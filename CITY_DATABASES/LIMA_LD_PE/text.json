        "wiki": "The Plaza Mayor or Plaza de Armas of Lima, is the birthplace  of the city of Lima, as well as the core of the city. Located in the Historic Centre of Lima, it is surrounded by the Government Palace, Cathedral of Lima, Archbishop's Palace of Lima, the Municipal Palace, and the Palace of the Union.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Plaza de Armas is surrounded by the Jiron Junin, Jiron de la Union, Jiron Huallaga, and the Jiron Carabaja avenues.\nIn 1523, King Charles I of Spain mandated the Procedures for the creation of cities in the New World. These procedures indicated that after outlining a city's plan, growth should follow a grid centered on the square shape of the plaza.\nOn the day of the foundation of the city, January 18, 1535, the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, conforming to established procedure, designated a location to build the plaza. Later, Pizarro and Nicolas de Rivera, the city's first mayor, toured the city's location and split parcels. Pizarro, taking advantage of his title of founder and governor, took a large parcel of land between the north side of the plaza and the Rimac river. The lot to the south of the plaza was designated to be a church, the western lot was to be the site of a city council, and the rest of the lots were divided among the rest of the conquistadors.\nThe 17th-century historian Bernab\u00e9 Cobo said of the plaza:\n...\"it is the finest and most well-formed [plaza] that I have ever seen, even in Spain. It occupies an entire block, with the width of four streets on one side and four streets on the other, and with all four sides it measures more than two thousand feet; it is very ample...\"\nSubsequently, the viceroy Diego L\u00f3pez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Velasco, count of Nieva, proposed the gallows, which had previously been located at the centre of the plaza, be moved nearer to the river to the location which is now the Desamparados train station. In place of it, a new water fountain was built at the centre of the plaza. The gallows were returned to the south side of the plaza on the Callejon de Petateros.\nThe first water fountain built on the plaza was constructed by the viceroy Francisco de Toledo, and was inaugurated on October 21, 1578. It consisted of a baluster and an elevated bowl, and in it had eight pipes through which water fell into the bowl on the next level. A ball at the top of the fountain dispersed water back onto the lower levels. The seal of the city was inscribed on this ball.\nThe water fountain was replaced in by the viceroy Garc\u00eda Sarmiento de Soto-mayor, count of Salvatierra, who inaugurated it on September 8, 1651. This fountain remains as the centerpiece of the plaza to this day.\nDuring the colonial era, the plaza served as a market, bull fighting ring, and the city gallows. The plaza also became home to the Auto de fe in which the inquisition occurred. The tribunal of the inquisition had one of its three courts located in Lima. The first conviction occurred on November 15, 1573 and this was the first heretic to be tried and executed in the new world.\nIn 1622, the Cathedral of Lima is completed. This church still stands today on the plaza.\nIn 1821, Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn proclaimed the Independence of Peru on this plaza. After this historic event, the flag of the new republic was paraded around the plaza.\nIn 1855, President Ram\u00f3n Castilla inaugurated the first public gas lighting system which were first installed on the light posts of the plaza. Also at this time, gardens were planted on the plaza as up until this time it was made of pavement. In 1860, the first rail ways for trams were installed on the plaza.\nIn 1922, construction of the Archbishop's Palace of Lima was completed. In 1938, the Government Palace was completed and in 1944 the Municipal Palace was completed.\n\n\n== Surroundings ==\n\n360\u00b0 view of Plaza Mayor, Lima\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCobo, Bernab\u00e9. \"Historia de la Fundaci\u00f3n de Lima\"\nBromley, Juan. \"Las viejas calles de Lima\" Lima: Municipalidad Metropolitana de Lima.

We did on of the best guided tours in the world: knowledgeable and entertaining... we started at noon and finished",

          "My opinion, for what it is worth, is that you can\u2019t visit Lima without visiting the Plaza. It is surrounded by impressive buildings and has a real buzz about it. There are plenty of locals and tourists (with a good police presence) going about their business. We were approached",
          "We visited Plaza De Armas as part of a Lima half day city tour. The Cathedral is well worth it. Absolutely beautiful. We also visited the very interesting Monastery and spent time looking at the plaza. This is a beautiful clean place full of interesting history. We recommend",
          "Lima as a city doesn\u2019t have a lot of architectural gems to offer as far as sightseeing goes, but this square alone has several beautiful buildings surrounding it. Really is the hub of historical old town Lima and a must visit in Lima. Instagram worthy!",

          "A variety of sights, sounds, dance with as many diverse visitors as there are displays of true and unique craftsmanship. Surrounding architecture and eateries punctuate the parque and one can actually appreciate the attraction to Miraflores. One unique, (odd?) note to add is",
          "If you've seen the Plaza de Armas and historic centres of Arequipa and Cusco you may as well skip this one. Too much traffic in and around Lima's historic centre is making it very unpleasant. The buildings are beautiful.",

          "So much nicer (clean/safe) than 20 years ago. Beautiful buildings and landscaping. The place was closed due to some event, but if you walk around the perimeter and look like you belong there, you might sneek in, as we did. That much nicer without the crowds! Would return",

          "Such a great spot in Lima - so worth your time. You get a green space Plaza with a fountain, lots and lots of locals (okay - and tourists), some magnificent buildings, and even a horse-drawn coach doing the rounds. It's the home of the Presidential Palace, the Archbishops Palace",
          "Right in the centre of town this is definitely a place to visit. There is a bit of hustle and bustle but the buildings are beautiful and is great to stroll around the plaza.",

          "Our tour bus and guide led us through the 16th century cathedral and the monastery. This is a colonial Unesco World Heritage site. The first stone was laid by Pizarro. Wow! We were not allowed to take pictures but as we toured we could hear the choir. The volumes in the world",

          "Very busy historic center of Lima. Certainly not enough to do or see here to warrant spending 45 minutes in a hot cab from the LarcoMar area. If we hadn't gotten lucky and caught the changing of the guard we would have been sorely disappointed. The square is surrounded by",
          "Fantastic plaza in the Historic Lima. The plaza is pretty safe since a lot of police officers hang in the main square. Although always keep an eye on your purse, camera and phone. Enjoy the photogenic area and do not forget to arrive before 12pm since there is a great military",

          "I don't think you need to spend a lot of time here but if you're only in Lima for one day you'll probably want to drop by as there is the cathedral and monastery close by. We didn't see the changing of the guard. We did see a lot of spiffing up for the Pope's visit later in",

          "A wonderful day with the bus would do it again as it's the best way to see so much in only a few hours. Even our guide spoke perfect English, so we're glad that we took this tour. Especially the main square with its architecture. Later on, I can highly recommend making a Pisco",

          "This is a lovely city center. Gardens are well-maintained. There are fountains and places to stop and just enjoy the sites. Architecture is beautiful and gives it a very old-world Spanish feel. You can hear church bells and see locals coming and going. The main attraction for us",

          "a place you will want to visit in Lima part of the old city and has a very spanish nature to it we went as part of a city tour but from thev amount of buses that passed the squre it must be on several bus roots so I would imagine very accessible from other parts of the city well",

          "All these places, Plaza, Iglesia y Convento, and Centro Historico are basically the same thing. Its sort of a required stop on any tour of Lima aside from the Cliff along Miraflores by the sea. This is one ride to an island of relative safety in a sort of dicey part of town",

          "The day we visited there were protests so getting into the square was hard. It's a proper look into the power base of Peru with Government buildings surrounding this spacious and classy square. Besides a few good photos there's not a lot to see.",
          "This area is worth taking time to explore. There is so much to see that you can take 2 hours or the whole day. Our family enjoyed walking around the plaza and seeing the historic buildings. We were there as it got dark and the buildings are beautiful in lights as well.",
          "Well worth the visit, but only if you've done a little homework and are ready to digest more of what you are seeing than the average tourist. This place has over 500 years of diverse history. From the Conquest, Consolidation, the Inquisition, all they way up to today. bring a",

        "wiki": "The Parque de la Reserva (English: Park of the Reserve) is a park located in downtown Lima, in Peru. Built in an irregular shape, it is located between two of the city's principal streets, the Paseo de la Republica expressway and Arequipa Avenue.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt has an area of eight hectares and is built in a neo-classical style. It was designed by the French architect Claude Sahut and is home to many sculptures built by Peruvian artists.Before construction, the land on which it is located belonged to the nearby Park of the Exposition before the area between 28 de Julio Avenue and Larrabure y Unanue Street was built over. In 1926 construction was commenced as ordered by the president Augusto B. Legu\u00eda. It was named of the Reserve in honor of the last soldiers who fought in the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos, and the Battle of Miraflores. The park was completed in 1929.\n\n\n== Magic Water Tour (El Circuito M\u00e1gico del Agua) ==\nThe Magic Water Tour, inaugurated July 26, 2007, currently comprises the property of the Park of the Reserve. The project was initially criticized because of its costs and design, and that it constituted a complete renovation of a historically significant park. Additionally, others objected the charging of entrance fees to a public place (S/.4.00 for ages 5 and above, as of Jan 2011). Proceeds from this entrance fee were once being used to renovate the Municipal Theatre of Lima, which has since been reopened. By March 1, 2008, the tour received its two millionth visitor. \nThe Magic Water Tour is currently the world record holder for the largest fountain complex in the world, consisting of 13 distinct fountains, many of which are interactive. All of the fountains are lighted at night, many with continuously changing color schemes.The largest fountain in the Park of the Reserve, named \"Magic Fountain\" (Fuente M\u00e1gica) contains a jet which forces water to a height of over 80 m. Additional attractions are the Tunnel Fountain of Surprises (Fuente T\u00fanel de las Sorpresas), a 35 m walk-thru tunnel of water ; the Children's Fountain (Fuente de los Ninos), a walk-in automated fountain; and a tunnel connecting the two sections of the park which contains an exhibition highlighting recent public works projects in Lima. The Fantasia Fountain (Fuente de la Fantasia), site of a regularly scheduled laser and picture show, is 120 m in length and contains jets that are synchronized to music. A video showcase of the fountains, in Spanish can be found here\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Get a spot right in front (middle) of the fuente, otherwise you won't be able to see everything. It's 15 minutes long and only interesting if you haven't seen anything like it before. I guess if you have kids it's great for them. It's a decent pass time for an evening in Lima.",
          "Some Lime\u00f1a friends of mine took me here and we had a magical evening together. Great photo opps and simply a great time to be had. Parking is a bit of a hassle, but was worth it, we all thought. I recommend going at night.",
          "A beautiful display of lights, colour and water. Definitely worth the trip to see it. It\u2019s just as easy to see by yourself rather than doing it on a tour, cheaper as well. Get an Uber there and back plus the 4 soles entry and you have saved a lot, asleep you get to spend as",
          "This park is simply amazing, well maintained and full of Peruvian artistry at its best. When I watch the light show on the water fountains I can't help but think that these Peruvians are a very proud people and I really like their culture. Do not miss a trip to this park and",
          "It's better to visit this place by your own instead of a tour guide. You should have more time to spend each fountaine and stay the time you want. Guide tours only give you few minutes to admire dancing waters.",
          "Go at dusk to see the fountains in daylight and then after dark. I think this was better than Las Vegas",
          "Cost s/4 or a bit over $1 usd. This place is super clean. They light it up at night. I would recommend dinner near their north gate. They have many stands there for food. (Stand 12 Lucha is the one we went to :D) The stands are just south of their stadium. Then I would go to",
          "So many people came out to enjoy the water fountains in the park! The fountains are large and plentiful. We enjoyed the hour we were there experience the sights. The main water show was good as the colors of the lights were fun to see. The music and lasers were not that",
          "The Magic Fountains are a nice way to pass some time in the evening. There are quite a few fountains that light up in squence and really are beautiful. The night I was there the music wasn't working so I could only go with a 4 star review but I would definitely go if you are",
          "Nice Park with excellent water fountains. The light shows they have are very good. We were there on a Sunday evening and it was quiet crowded. Especially great if you go with children. Take light jacket as it gets chilly with the mist.",
          "e walked in for an evening show (entrance only at Gate 3, 4 soles/adult), they have it every night when the wind allows. Nice, colorful show, the smaller fountains will have each something different to add. When with kids in Lima it is a must visit, a good IG and selfie-spot for",
          "went without my wife first time while in Lima then went to machu pichu got stranded in cusco and missed flight in lima . had 8 hrs wait for trip to US . Brought my wife again 2 days later to see this while waiting at chavez int airport entrance was one dollar",
          "Really amazing show and lots of different fountains around. An absolute must in Lima. Make sure to get there early to secure a good spot for the show!",
          "We had no idea what to expect from this attraction, other than it involved water fountains. We arrived early for the show, and spent about 90 minutes walking around the park to see the fountains and gardens, which are spectacular. When it got dark, we walked to the large",
          "The park has many fountains and each of them also has many features of its own. Access to the park was easy. Signage was also good. The food outlets were very limited.",
          "It was just amazing loved the show worth seeing entertainment for everyone young and old just brilliant",
          "The park is large so it will take about an hour to walk the whole thing and see all the fountains..7 as I recall. The real show us the huge fountain that once an hour presents music, graphics, and lights in the water. Certainly worth the effort to see",
          "The Circuito Magico del Agua is a wonderful way to spend an evening in Lima. The water show rivals anything you'd see in Vegas, is a fraction of the cost, and is family-friendly! I loved every moment of it and would highly recommend it to visitors of Lima!",
          "went at night to see the show around 8:15pm. it gets pretty crowded. the show is nice, with projections on the water and images of peru and its culture. there are many vendors of churros, popcorn and apples which are very inexpensive. the entrance for a foreign tourist was four",
          "Stand far back to watch the light and water show for maximum viewing. Bring towel and change of clothes if you go into the interactive fountain.",
          "This is a spectacular park of fountains and water features accompanied by music. It is best to visit at night when the features are illuminated. We go whenever we have overseas visitors but it is always popular. Wonderful for adults and children and inexpensive too Any city in",
          "It\u2019s just a mile or so from the historic city center and only 4 soles each to enter the park, which has 13 water features some of which are interactive. The park actually has the Guinness record for world\u2019s largest fountain complex in a public park and the tallest fountain of 80",
          "to hang out and to a have a good time just walking around, a nice stop to cool down after a long walk.",
          "Our friends had recommended that we visited this park. It is stunning not just to admire the amazing water fountains with the lights and music but also the beautifully kept grounds with flowers and activities for kids. No wonder so many families were heading to this park to",
          "very beautiful this place It has a spectacular setting very nice fun I suggest it for everyone Thank you",
          "We had a great time walking and observing the exhibits of water fountains and geysers. Fun night guy and very accessible",
          "Great place. We really enjoyed walking around the park. Safe, clean and fun place to visit. The water show was good too.",
          "The fountains and light shows are fun and the park invited to walk around for some time. I think we spent here roughly 3h?! By taxi from our hotel in Miraflores this was 20 soles. Good programme for an evening as we wanted to do as much as possible, well recommended.",
          "We took a taxi out quite a ways but were pleasantly surprised. The main show goes on 3 times a night but throughout the night there is plenty of things to do and see.",
          "I was blown away. This is a park with 10 unique water fountains set that attracts lots of locals during the day and more at night. It\u2019s an entertainment venue woh playground area for kids, food and benchs for just sitting and enjoying. And then the show... water, music lasers",
          "The fountains of the park are very nice (there are better fountains around the world, of course), but what we really liked was the fact you can interact with them. Our kid loved, despite the cold weather. I imagine if we went in summer times, how good it would be. It`s a little",
          "Great place to visit. Entrance fee is not expensive, but be aware of your return to the hotel, lot of traffic almost impossible to use public transportation. Before you go make sure you get a good plan to return back to your hotel.",
          "The park where the fountains are was well laid out and spacious. The fountains themselves were pretty but with the exception of the 15 minutes laser light show the attraction was mediocre. Our bus ride back to our hotel was 90 minutes long-Just about as long as the visit to",
          "Though quite a treck away from Mirafloras it is worth it. Entrance to the park works out at about \u00a31 per person (BARGAIN). It's a park with a lot of intresting fountains. Some your able to interact with (one that creates a walkway for example). There is also a water, light and",
          "I've been there 4 times, and is perfect for a family or a couples day. The views of the fountains are amazing, there are a lot of things to do. You can eat almost everything, Anticuchos, picarones, Ice creams, peruvian desserts, peruvian food. The place have a few trains for",
          "A water fountain park, with a show that is a display of water and lights to music. 4 sol entry fee. Small playground for children. Easy to walk in and worth a visit at night to see the lights more clearly.",
          "The water fountain park is a little out of the city center, but definitely worth the trip out there. We took Uber, and it was only around $5 each way. Plan to get there when the water show is going on. Either before or after the show, you can walk through the park and enjoy",
          "In a city where is difficult to find public attractions, this park is a jewel with good architecture, technology and security.",
          "The best fountain show we have seen! It is fun to walk around the park to see all the fountains and then watch the 15 minute show. The only problem we had was getting an Uber back to our hotel as it was so busy outside the park. Still it was worth the visit and felt safe even",
          "The action begins at 6:00 pm, an impressive play of lights and water where we could take very nice photos, it is a simple place to reach on your own, very close to the Miraflores neighborhood.",
          "This park lights up on the afternoons, check days it\u2019s open but when it is there are fountain shows and projections into the mist, there are many different installations with a large variety of stalls out front and dotted around in the grounds! It\u2019s about $2 aus to get in and",
          "This is a very interesting and beautiful park to visit at night. I felt safe and there were many people from babies to seniors. If you get a chance to go to this water park, do it!",
          "Beautiful and massive water and fountain show featuring music and video display over light shows. You have to see to believe how great it is. There are many many fountains in the park and admission is reasonable. Much better than Bellargio's fountain.",
          "In Lima, make time to see the Magical Water Fountain Circuit. More than a dozen water fountains with differing shapes and styles. The main fountain ran a 40 minute show of images projected through the water spray. Very cool. Make time to go!!",
          "Very colorful nice walk around the park. A nice evening to see the light and water show. There are a few fountains around and structures. There is also a playground for children. Nice for a family to go to. There are small stalls for snacks and drinks, places for you to sit and",
          "I had a wonderful time here. A great place to go at evening/night time. The fountains are beautiful but not too extravagant. The atmosphere is great here, great for a family with kids or a date night. You'll love it here.",
          "It was an unforgettable experience, the day I went with my partner was a very quiet holiday and all the colorful fountains that could be seen at night.",
          "Beautiful light, water, music and audiovisual show for less than two dollars a person. You can\u2019t go wrong.",
          "If you are in the area in the evening, it is an inexpensive park to visit 13 different water fountain configurations that are lit up. A 15 min video/laser show to music is projected onto sheets of water at 1930, 2030 and 2130 Tues- Sun.",
          "Visiting this Foutain Park was part of a tour. It t is considered biggest water fountain park in world by Guuiness Book world records. Its worth seeing!",
          "Better than expected! Spend time to see all the 13 fountains, they are all pretty but the choreographed water show at fantasy fountain is spectacular, a creative and colorful way to showcase Peru!!",
          "The sound and light show is worth a visit, Lots of different fountains to be able to interact with. Children have great fun there.",
          "We visited this park during the day, not at night, however it was still a very nice experience. The cost was 4 sol each. There are many fountains and space to relax and watch the water and the people. Plenty of bathrooms and food.",
          "It\u2019s best to visit at night as the fountains are laser illuminated with spectacular images projected through the water particles. The fountains are many and there is so much to entertain all the family, especially the kids. The main show goes for about 15 minutes and is",
          "The fountains were wonderful the park was beautiful. Our tour guide was very informative. Well worth the 4soles entry fee",
          "Can't forget the experience. Must visit even for people who have seen other water fountains. Don't miss the show at the longest fountain. We went with a guide which was totally unnecessary",
          "Amazing place with 13 illuminated at night water fountains. A light and sound show starts every day at 7.15pm, 8.15pm, 9.15pm and 10.15pm, lasting around 10 minutes. Moreover the parcel is easily accessible with the Metropolitano. Note a little entrance fee of 4Sol per person.",
          "Nice walk around the park. Try to see the show with the story of peru. The first starts at 19.30 The ticket costs 4 soles",
          "Whenever you are in Lima, this is a must! Hundreds of fountains and colors perform a gigantic water show at the sounds of classical music. The water curtain from the fountains is even used as a projection screen on which you can see dance performances, the downtown of Lima and",
          "It's a good place to visit with family or kids. The labyrinth is a very good initiative to have fun!",
          "We went here as part of a tour. Went here first and then to a dinner and show. I would recommend you visit by your self. The tour limited you to only about 30 minutes. Very inexpensive to attend. Do not miss the laser show in the middle of the park. There is a starting point and",
          "The tour circles the Historic district, but NEVER STOPS so you can take a beautiful night shot - ONLY REASON I NEEDED A NIGHT TOUR IN THIS DANGEROUS AREA. Water park could have been really fantastic if you didn't have a guide who was so adamant about the three-minute rule for",
          "Beautiful park, worth to visit! Entrace fee for an adult - 4 soles. The best time to enter the park is obviously the dark part of the day. We did it somewhere between 6pm - 7pm. Very clean and lovely atmosphere!",
          "If you are visiting Lima you need to come here, it\u2019s AMAZING! The fountain light show is spectacular.",
          "Recently went here on a Sunday night and had a fun time. I don't consider it a must-do but we were glad we went. Probably would be more fun with young children. We only watched the fountains and walked around the park but you can also be more interactive and \"get wet\" by",
          "To end our day we came here, our chef recommended it as we had no plans yet before we'd head to Cusco the next day. It's quite fresh in Lima, so bring a jacket. The fountains and light shows are fun and the park invited to walk around for some time. I think we spent here",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the magical water circuit in Lima. I was truly surprised by the beauty of the place, particularly at night where you can visited a dozen different fountains with all sorts of different themes, amounts of water, and colors. It was beautiful to see",
          "These fountains are beautiful, whimsical, delightful. One outlier was the charming teapot. Edward Scissorhands, have you been to visit? The sound of the park is just one more reason to go: water falling, classical music playing, families admiring. I loved this!",
          "On vacation in Lima, we had a night to ourselves and went here on recommendation from our hotel. It was well worth the $4 entry fee. It's a beautiful park with a laser light show displayed through a computer controlled fountain. Very high tech and fun show. Great for a",
          "Came back for 2nd time. Is a beautiful park with interactive water fountains. Show projects on water fountains and music too. I believe show was better first time I was there 9 years ago. This time was good however it can be better. Kids lives this places it has a train that",
          "Local friends prevailed on us to try it and it turned out to be truly worth it. Tour guide was excellent, but I suspect it would be just fine un-guided. However you do it, be sure to catch the last exhibit for the timed light/sound show.",
          "This was the best thing we did in the city. The fountains are a must see. Our guide was very good. She recommend beef hearts in Cusco, which I ordered which were awesome. Variety of fountains, very good laser show. The condor laser was awesome.",
          "This parc is definitely worth a visit and 4 Soles entry is a cheap entrance fee. I saw the show at 7.15 but would recommend the show at 8.15 as it is already darker by then.",
          "Beautiful park and display of water fountains and lights. This is a must see when visiting Lima and is great for the kids. There is a light show at certain times and some interactive water fountain displays. Dress warm as the water from the fountains can make the air a little",
          "One of the best attractions ever. It's better going at night, it is also fun to go in summer at any time.",
          "The trip is short and I would recommend it for family, especially people traveling with children. If you don't have much time in Lima I recommend visiting other attractions.",
          "Go after 6pm! It really worths the wait! If you go in couple, visit the heart tunnel! So many flowers!",
          "We barely made it in before the show started because there was a huge line, but thankfully got in within enough time. Beautiful water show in the evenings, for only 4.00 soles per person. We really enjoyed walking around the park afterwards and it was beautiful. We ate",
          "We went around 21h00. Lima is pretty safe but the surrounding areas of this water park are not for evening Adventures and discovery! Basically just plan your evening trip to go straight to the park, enjoy the fountains, watch the 15 minutes show, and you can even buy snacks,",
          "Go by night and you will se a water show and and enjoy a beautiful park. In the summer you can refresh yourselve on some water founts.",
          "The park is very cool and big, it's perfect to take a long walk and see beautiful and funny fountains",
          "These fountains are pretty at night. You can walk along the pathways and in the summer the kids can play in the water and get wet. It's a lot of fun for them!",
          "This is a popular attraction for locals and can be crowded on weekends. It was interesting, but you may not be super impressed if you have seen the water show in Las Vegas. I would recommend doing this as part of a longer guided tour. I did the one that takes you to a",
          "The park itself is a cool and quiet place to take a stroll, but it gets incredibly crowded for the light and water show - which is just normal given that the show is visually stunning. Entry fee of 4 soles.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by the water circuit park. These beautifully designed fountains capture your attention and make a wonderful nighttime activity.",
          "There are many fountains and some of them you can even go under the water without getting wet or play with the water always without getting wet.The show is amazing with projectors projecting videos on the walls of water created by lots of fountains. Totally worth it",
          "Great value for four sols. We spent about 90 mins here and found it charming. Open Tuesday - Sunday but three times a night (currently 7.15, 8.15 and 9.30 but please check) the main fountains dance to music for 15 minutes. This is clearly a well-loved local attraction with lots",
          "If you have a free quiet evening in Lima with absolutely no plans, you may consider this attraction. As Bus 301 runs from our hotel on Larco all the way to Plaza San Martin passing by Parque de la Reserve, we decided to visit on our first night in Lima. The bus ride was long as",
          "Very beautiful and entertaining. It was chilly since it's winter there now from the opposite side of the equator. Definitely a place to visit when you're in Lima.",
          "A really nice place to spend hours during the night in Lima,this park is really cool with all the lights and music.",
          "My cousin brought me here. Although the water fountains were nice, i would have enjoyed it better if it was during the summer time. This would be best for younger kids. The water show included laser type rays on the water which paid homage to Peruvian cultures. Music was nice",
          "I tried to go here on July 6th as a part of a Lima at night tour, and when we arrived, it was not working. Seems like they could have just given us a ticket to return on a different date, but they wouldn't do that.",
          "We went in the evening when all the lights are on the fountains and were amazed to see different sculptures and flower arrangements. Later in the evening was the actual show where they projected scenes from the different parts on Peru onto the water itself. Very impressive and",
          "El circuito magico del agua it is a really nice place to spend some hours during the night in Lima, the place is really cool with all the lights and music and outside of the place you have access to different restaurants with criolla food.",
          "The wonderful, colorful fountains is a \"must be visited one\" during a Lima stay. It had a few sol admission-ticket (4sol/person in Jun 2019) but it would be worth even more I think. The only thing we had problems is to find the entrance - especially as we decided to take a long",
          "Many water sprays with color . It goes on around 7:00 pm when it gets dark out. It is on during the day light but the colors are not on until dark 7:pm",
          "Nice spot to walk around and see the fountains. Lots of people around and super easy to get a taxi back to the hotel.",
          "Best destination in Lima if you have free time in the evening. abt 8-10 soles by cab from city ctr- cheap ticket 4 soles /person, many food stands, fountains were numbered so easy to follow the arrows and the map. Be sure to go through the tunnel and see both sides of the park.",
          "One of the best attractions in the entire city, this was so good I went back 3 times to see it again! Bring a towel!",
          "I definitely recommend going on an evening where they do the water shows, as the displays were brilliant. It has a lovely variation of fountains and displays and was a great way to spend the evening.",
          "This is one of the few attractions that is good to see at night. There are many interesting designs of fountains and several that are best experienced with personal interaction. The laser show presented at scheduled times is impressive. It is a great experience for families and",
          "The park has a bunch of fountain and water displays. Some have high arch where they project scenes of people dancing to the music that's played in the background, Everyone just walks around and sometimes through the fountain arch's.... Very nice.",
          "Interesting place to get recommended at night, after a walk through the main square, its cathedral, headquarters of the central government and the city",
          "Honestly we expected something else. Lima has a hectic traffic and it took us some time to reach there from Barranco. We found it not worth to make that trip for a show which lasts only fifteen minutes. If you have already been at similar shows in Las Vegas or somewhere else you",
          "A ten minute taxi from the hotel, and we got to visit a lovely park area, with about a dozen different water features, some interactive. Then a 15 minute water,light and laser show, highlighting the history and culture of Peru. Excellent !! and all for 4 sol (one pound). Great",
          "Great way to spend an evening. The light show is at 7.15, 8.15 and 9.15, but even without the show, it's lovely to walk around enjoying the fountains - especially the walk trough and the jumping ones. Lots of places to sit and take in the views - the gazebo area is just lovely",
          "These fountains and the show that is put on are amazing! The water fountain is the backdrop for music and a laser light show that displays many Peruvian cultural aspects.",
          "Paid 4 soles each (5 and under are free). Has nice colorful fountains. Directions to each fountain were not that great. No display of proper times of fountain laser shows but i noticed them happening once every 15mins after the hour (615pm, 715pm, 815pm, etc). We took some nice",
          "I highly recommend visiting this park. The gardens are beautiful and it was peaceful. Although the light show is at night, you shouldn't miss being here in the day.",
          "What a marvellous experience this was. Stunning show with music, lasers and colour. Highly recommend as a must see attraction",
          "This place is just amazing how they been able to management to put together the lights and water display it\u2019s insane if you want to have fun don\u2019t think twice a try to go and see this Lima attraction 100% recommended",
          "The Circuito M\u00e1gico Del Agua, the Magic Water Circuit, is located in the Parque de la Reserva, inaugurated in the late 1920s. As the years went by, the park, where several important historical monuments are located, fell in disrepair and neglect and by the 1970s to the early",
          "We spent a couple of hours enjoying this park. The fountains are excellent. The park is well kept and easily accessible. The fantasia show is worth watching",
          "This is a MUST DO when in Lima. There is a water/light show that goes for about 15 mins every hour or so in the evening. Then you can walk around to see the many fountains in the park. Some are very stunning. There is a tunnel fountain you can walk through that was fun. Kids",
          "fun to go in large groups, especially the 14-22 crowd as it's a great place for social media photos. i recommend going at night.",
          "Go on your own, do not do a tour here. Is about $4 to enter the park and you can see all the fountains. Is beautiful!!",
          "This one deserves 5 stars. When you see the magical waters at night. You will never forget it. Here's the picture I took. That's nothing, compared to the water show they do. Where they change the color, and shape of water at the same time.",
          "You can totally do this place on your own. It's about a 40-minute taxi ride (worse if there's traffic, which there usually is in Lima) from Miraflores (the taxi should cost 20-25 soles each way), but this place sure is worth it. The fountains are beautiful at night. There is a",
          "The water shows were nice to look at. Can not walk/stand on any of the grass. Bathroom is a bit hard to find.",
          "Nice enough- fountains and colored lights, and the jaguar projection was amazing. Small compared to some in the US. Different- walk under the arch of water.",
          "We stayed in Lima for a few days as part of our tour. This place was recommended to us by our tour guide and it was well worth the visit. We went at night by taxi. It\u2019s safe, creative, just beautiful. I\u2019m glad we got to spend some time there.",
          "At first I did not know if it would be worth coming here just to see a fountain show (i.e., Las Vegas?). After coming to the Lima laser light and fountain show, I was very glad that I had came - it is much nicer than any other fountain shows. This Park has 13 totally different",
          "Fun and lively and affordable, this light water and fountain show shows off a unique Peruvian flavor and is a fun watch. But there\u2019s more than the show to do at the various fountains; a great safe night activity.",
          "This was very well designed. They projected both still and moving images as well as laser beams onto the spouting water. It was a short show (lasted 15 minutes) but I would definitely recommend it. The park also has a wide array of different fountains so it is worth visiting the",
          "This place was beautiful. I would advise only going in the day if it's warm as it's much more impressive when lit up in the evening. We saw it both lit and unlit during our visit as we went late afternoon - evening. The food is pretty cheap - although not healthy and very meat",
          "Having been here several times, it just doesn't get old. If you visit, make sure you stay for the light show in the evening. The park is realaxing and very clean. Parking is ample and clean.",
          "This was an unexpected stop and a nice surprise. The water shows were impressive and large crowds gathered, so arrive early to stake out a location so you can see all of the shows.",
          "Our hotel told us about this park which has a circuit around illuminated fountains. There are a couple of 30 minute shows each evening which include a laser show projected onto a large water fountain. Also includes a tunnel made of arches of illuminated water and fun fountains",

          "It's beautiful, it's cheap. It's full of locals going out with their kids. If you've ever been to disney land when it get dark, it feels very similar. Very festive, nice snacks available, beautiful fountains, a neat story played projected against huge walls of water. I think",
          "This park wasn't in our original itinerary. But since we heard lotsa good things about this place, tried to squeeze this in and visited the park at night. It was a colorful visit and was nice to see the laser show on water as well. A good experience & I would recommend the same.",
          "We heard many unfavorable remarks about Peru taxis, particularly unlicensed one and thus were very worried how to see this. The organised trip cost was \u00a335 for 4 hrs and absolutely no point to go in a conduced trip. When we arrived at Peru and downloaded Uber and Easy Taxi app",
          "The park is really cute we got there a little early so we got to see the park in day light and waited for the 1st water show! It\u2019s rly something they sell food we got us a snack really enjoyed the show and the park.",
          "We are glad we decided to spend an evening here. $7 for a taxi ride from Miraflores, super cheap to get in. It was super crowded with mainly locals but worth the visit. Very well maintained.",
          "It is a very nice park that costs only 4 soles, with beautiful fountains, colors, music and kiosks. Worth to spend some time there and just relax",
          "We took a taxi to see the fountain show. We got there early and wondered around. The fountains are fun and the grounds beautiful. The show was spectacular. This was the Belagio fountains meets Disney on steroids. It was truly pure magic. Even my teens were impressed. The show",
          "Nice fountains and water features (Good optio 4-10 year-old children, in my opinion) but very \u201ctouristy\u201d and crowded at night. There was a dog exposition going on that was interesting. Safety may be an issue... park kept announcing \u201cbeware of pickpockets during show\u201d.",
          "A lot of fountains with colors and music and is just 4 soles...! Great place to spend the afternoon, and scape of the messy Lima",
          "This show is spectacular! It is a combination laser light show and water show. The sound quality is very good and the timing of the lights is perfect. The various fountains are quite interesting",
          "It was a bit crowdy because it was Saturday, but we got to see the show from a good location, it's a place to have a nice walk and look at the fountains. Good way to finnish your visit in Lima.",
          "There are 12 fountains to tour and a nightly show that is offered 3 time. It's about $2 to enter and worth it. The show is about 20 minutes long and the water dances to music and a history based movie is shown on the water.",
          "One of the loveliest small museums my wife and I have ever seen. Learned much about pre-Inca culture and how it influenced the flowering of Incan civilization; the building itself and flowering bougainvillea; and a delicious lunch in the garden combined to make a sublime",
          "This is a definite must do in Lima. Words and pictures cannot do justice to describe the wonder. If you are limited on time, make sure to put this on your top 3 things to do.",
          "When our taxi driver recommended this place, we were unsure and didn't expect much from it. This is a great place to go for a date and is suitable for any age. They even have a playground for kids. They also have food vendors, so you can probably just have your dinner there.",
          "The fountains were very impressive with an array of fountains to see, walk into and through and the finale was really spectacular. We were there at the weekend when the crowds were huge. Would recommend for anyone visiting Lima",
          "Great evening activity in Lima. The water show was gorgeous, think Disneyland's World of Color, but Peru-themed! Was not as crowded as I expected. The park is not too large and you can finish it in about an hour and a half. For 4 Soles, it just can't be beat! Easy to catch a",
          "So many more fountains than I expected and only four soles for entry! Lights were beautiful. Fun to walk around and enjoy the park, come after dark and see the laser show.",
          "Super cheap entry with more than a dozen lit fountains and an amazing water show at one of them. Be sure you're in the right side of the projections. Great for kids too.",
          "Great night out! Amazing show! Great parking. Eager to help staff! You must visit this park at night if you are going to Lima.",
          "Cheap night out and surprisingly great. The music, lights and fountains make for a great evening event. Make the effort you will be surprised how enjoyable it is. This is definitely a must see while in Lima.",
          "This magic water shoots better than any fireworks we have seen ! Water that creates holographic images and looks like it\u2019s burning ! Truly something no visitor to Lima should miss. The admission fee is ridiculously low and seniors even get in for free! What a feast!",
          "A must see on your Lima visit. The fountains are very beautiful and the light show is magical. Make sure you plan your visit to capture the light show, you will be awed.",
          "It was great actually, quite cheap and beautiful beginning to end. Loved the water fountains and the lights, the music, everything was on point. Loved it",
          "For 4 Soles you can watch a light and projection show in a font. It's very different and beautiful, and a good option to spend the beginning of the night in Lima.",
          "What a great end to our 2 week trip to Peru. We had been to the Amazon, Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu, Cusco and Lake Titicaca. Our plane back home was at 2 am so we had some time to kill before our flight. We went to see the magical fountains at night and they were all lit up.",
          "I decided to write this review while realizing that I may have to go back to look at the show again. Apparently we had been watching the show from the side angle while it is to be seen from the front... and we were in awe already. It is spectacular! The park has many other",
          "Lovely lights too much to see and very enjoyable and well recommended Never seen such a spectacular light show !",
          "Lovely atmosphere in a lovely park with nice fountains and nice light installations illuminating the park greatly.",
          "It was on my list to see. Maybe we had a chilly evening, but we spent there no more than 30 min max. Lots of families, lots of couples, lots of water. But for me it was a waisted time. If you have better plans for your time in Lima - you may easily skip this park.",
          "\"Absolutely mesmerizing\" was this long fountain row composed of \"quite a number\" of individual fountains with each shooting up into the air for what I would guess to be somewhere above 50 feet while the colors of the fountains were also changing from like minute to minute",
          "Amazing place to spend the night! Love the lights and music. There are still many taxis waiting outside at the park closing time. So no worries to get back to your hotels afterwards.",
          "Definitely the best is going during the night or in a very sunny day. I strongly recommend to go with at least an additional T-shirt if you want to play with the fountains. And avoid grey days, sometimes can be cold.",
          "Incredibile show of dancing water... the fonts, the music , the light ... must visit Its fun and actually romantic ...",
          "There are various fountains in this area. The high light of this is the musical fountain. The children have a wonderful time running through the fountain. Also there is a toy train which goes around the park.",
          "Was on a business trip in Lima and stopped here as a fun activity in the evening. Lots of families! We went for the latest showing. Fountain show is beautiful and lasts about 20 minutes. Nice place to walk around. Not much more to do for more than an hour. Don\u2019t pay more than",
          "This was a great show. We loved it. It was the Perfect ending to a perfect day in Lima. Thank you Integrity Tourism for including this at the end of our day.",
          "Nice place to visit specially if you have kids. The show is very relaxing to see the water moving with the music....and the color is a nice addition. It can get crowded so try to get there early.",
          "Imaginative use of water and lasers creates a story quite different to anything we have seen before. There are thirteen fountains in the park one of which is an arch of water you can walk through ( be prepared for a few splashes). Situate yourself at the main display at least",
          "Surpassed expectations! Well worth the visit. Enjoyable for all ages. Take the time to explore the park before or after the show!",
          "Only 4 soles and very close to the bus terminal, national stadium which is easy to catch. The show is worth watching. It goes for about 15mins and I recommend getting a spot 15mins before the show. The show is on the long line of fountains so pick one in the middle",
          "The multimedia light show starts at 7:15pm and was amazing. There is some entertainment for kids like fountains to play with the water and a little train. Also there are local food (like anticuchos or picarones) and chicha morada for sale. I went by myself but saw some tourist",
          "So many fountains in the Lima Park - the kids and adults alike lkved the interactive water fountains and the show!",
          "We ubered up to the park from Millaflores just before 8 and we\u2019re happy to find out that a light show started at 8:15. I think they run every hour. Great experience for only 4 soles a person. The lightshow is really fun and lasts about 15 minutes. We spent another 1.5 hours",
          "We had a slight idea of what to expect here, and it ended up being a magical night of water, light, and sound. You'll be doing yourself a favor to visit.",
          "We took a 50 day South America cruise with a stop in Lima, Peru. We booked the excursion through our cruise line and we were not disappointed! This is a beautiful place with so many artistic fountains to enjoy. Lots of creative fountains and multi-colored lights. My favorite",
          "We strolled though this site with our teen and tween sons and had a great time. No matter the age, everyone will love this wonderful attraction. It\u2019s very reasonably priced, vibrant, and charming. Make sure your visit spans day and night so you can read the signs and see the",
          "One of the most beautiful park in Lima, big and comfortable, excellent decoration and the show is just magnificent. This is a place in Lima in which people form PERU and abroad must go.",
          "it really is a nice park with beautiful laser show. Nice to go with the younger children by day and older children by night.",
          "A great place to end a night in Lima. The water fountains light up at night and there is music playing throughout the park creating a lovely atmosphere. We only spent about an hour here, but it was only 4 soles a person!",
          "The park was hot, dark & thronging with tourists & local Peruvians the night we were there. Schools had started back the day before after the long holiday & families were there en masse. Literally thousands, most of whom luckily were going to the football stadium nearby, so we",
          "The show was so cool! It lasts about 15 mins, but make sure that you also make time to walk around the large park which has 12 different fountains to look at. Admission was cheap (S/ 4). I would recommend getting a cab to drop you off and then find another one to pick you up at",
          "They put on a good show and the laser light show is outstanding. I would suggest going with a tour company as it is safer.",
          "Great place to go in the evening to have fun with friends. The water and light show is a unique experience. Lots of walking, but there is a little train that you can ride when you get tired (extra fee).",
          "Nice video shown in water. Starting at 8pm. I recomend to come on summer time, with warm weather at night.",
          "Its amazing what you can see there, mostly at nights. Dont miss the opportunity Its not that expensive to go. And each night they do have a very awesome light show",
          "The place has a very nice location and is well maintained. Peruvians are lucky to have this place. Although it\u2019s pretty the show isn\u2019t very good. It doesn\u2019t follow a story just images and the volume is way too low. It wasn\u2019t so pleasant to watch the show when a lady is screaming",
          "Very creative and beautiful parc during the day, but it truly comes alive at night :-) Easily reachable by bus or taxi and a must see when you're in the Lima area.",
          "The light show is amazing, and brings every one together, it is great for all ages, but the kids would love it. Make sure u bring a raincoat as u might need it on one of the attractions",
          "Lima has a lot of small parks and green squares but this one really surprised us, entrance is paid but well worth the visit.",
          "One of the things on my predetermined list to do in Lima was to check out the Magic Water Circuit, a big park in the center filled with colorful water fountains and music playing. Honestly, I was looking more forward to this than the infamous Plaza de Armas and it did not",
          "simply magical, a must go if happen you are in town around the hours that the show is on, cheap admission ticket.",
          "The park with its fountains is a fun for all activity but make sure you know when and where the laser and light show is.",
          "Superb park with inexpensive tickets. Would definitely recommend going at night to see the lights. To be honest, wouldn't stay there for too long--once you walk around the park there's not much else. But the water fountains are incredible.",
          "This is definitely worth adding to your \u201cto do\u201d list. I had never experienced anything like it before. The images projected onto the spray of water were amazing. Seniors can enter the park free. Go early as the lineup to get in can be long.",
          "It is a very funny place!! I just loved it. I went with my husband and we couldn't stop laughing. It was awesome.",
          "As our driver Jorge maneuvered his car through the traffic, our tour guide Jordan gave us a brief history of Peru. He emphasized that Per\u00fa gets NO rainfall so we were kind if prepared for the crowds at this water park. But what we weren\u2019t prepared for were the number of",
          "We spent a pleasant evening strolling the park for an hour before the 7:15 show. It wasn't too crowded and the show didn't disappoint. There were lots of different colored lazers, images, and dancing water - the cheetah running accross the water screen was exceptional. Playing",
          "Popular and fun water fountains show with music and colour around Peruvian themes. A good introduction or good bye to the vibrant city of Lima.",
          "Almost a must if you stay in Lima 3 or more days. It will take 2/3 hours. Different, creative, very clean and in the evenings 3 dancing water shows (19:15, 20:15, 21:30) with classical and Peruvian music and images projected on the water fountains. Tkt. is U$D 1.20. I f you have",
          "Nice scenario during the night. This is one of those places where you can go with your partner and fall in love even more. Wonderful!",
          "If you want a real feel for Lima and it's citizens, then spend the evening at this venue. It was truly a remarkable event which we thoroughly enjoyed.",
          "This water fountain park didn't get as crowded as I imagined it to be on a hot Lima summer night, but I guess it was due to my visit on a weekday. Walking through the park and seeing the different lights & fountains was charming! If you're a family with little kids, this must be",
          "This was well worth a visit, the special effects were fantastic and it cost about \u00a31 per person and is free for over 60's.",
          "It\u2019s totally worth it. It would be better to go with your partner since it\u2019s very romantic. It is a must if you come to Lima",
          "Although it was very crowded, we had no trouble seeing the laser/water show which lasted about 15 minutes. There is plenty more to see besides the show and beautiful picture taking opportunities. The entry was 4 soles with shows at 7:15, 8:15 and 9:30.",
          "A great way to cool off after the heat we've had in Lima recently. I had so much fun (as an adult lol) but I felt like a kid, I loved it!",
          "To pay around 1\u20ac for this park and the show is priceless. Nice show of water and light. One of the nicest things to do in Lima, specially if you travel with children.",
          "This is a cheap and economical excursion! So wonderful to see so many local families enjoying the fountains and the park! The grounds and fountains were beautiful. We had a tour guide but honestly the admission was very cheap and a tour is not necessary just get a cab and go and",
          "I went there in the afternoon because I have a tight schedule and could not go at night. It was a mistake. The park only open at night. I saw the display of light from the far side when I took the taxi passing by and thought it is worthwhile to check it out.",
          "At only 4 Nuevo soles, this is cheap entertainment. The park was full of families enjoying the cool of the evening. The fountains are nice, but the big draw is the show that is put on 3 tines a night, Tuesday to Sunday. With lasers, coloured fountains, and video shown against",
          "It was very nice to go at night, the entrance fee is very affordable and going in a taxi Uber or Cabify is much better than spending money on taking a tour. The weather is just excellent. Going on a weekday is much better and you will see the fountains, they are unique with the",
          "Specially if you are with with children they will also enjoy it. Go with confortable shoes you have a long walk thru the fountains",
          "It is one of the 10 top and must visit place while in Lima, you can\u00b4t miss the wonderful place special time to visit 08.00 pm in summer Dec to March bring your towel or short form Apr to Nov bring something to cover or change clothes is you do not wet you did not enjoy it.",

          "Great place for groups of all ages. 3, 15 min shows per night (except Monday) & lots to see & do with interactive water exhibits in a beautiful park.",
          "I caught the 7:15 show on a Saturday night and loved it. It lasted about 15 minutes and was very impressive. I saw the fountain show in Barcelona and think I prefer this one as it had more variety. It was very crowded with families when I was there. Traffic was pretty bad",
          "It is very well managed but extremely missable. We went on a Sunday so it was very crowded. It's more for kids under the age of 10.",
          "It\u2019s a great tour if you have kids, at night they have a light show with sound and image very nice display",
          "This is one of the largest wter and fountain displays in the world and it is a MUST SEE and visit. Inexpensive to enter, it accommodates lots of people for the 3 shows every evening. You can even walk through the water fountains which are all computerized. It has one of the",
          "Experienced the different fountains and laser watershow with a tour company that started at Larcomar shopping centre - open bus on the upper deck with 2x USB charging ports per double chairs. WIFI enabled but you needed the password to access (not freely given). Traffic in Lima",
          "Nice and entertaining. A thing that gives Lima some sort of city look. Worth seeing even if just to rest from the noise, pollution, dust and disorder reigning in this loosely organised mess of a city.",
          "The water fountains are magical and well worth a visit. The park is full of a variety of different areas making for a very pleasant evening",

          "Very, very crowded on a Sunday. Think of the Bellagio fountains in Vegas and then triple the crowd. Not really a fountain show but a laser light show projected against a curtain of water. Again, a nice visit, but no not a must see.",
          "It is a great place during summer. You can enjoy the water show and show lights, it is a great atmosphere for friends and family.",

          "Great time to spend with family and friends. They have a small fair with machiines, food. The water show is about traditional dances and the areas of Peru. Pretty amazing",
          "I'd definitely recommend a visit here if you have the time one night. Its nice to have a stroll around the park and is cheap at only 4 Soles. Also very popular with kids. Its also dog friendly. The light shows can be see at the main fountain area where there is a large fountain",
          "Such a gem in Lima. We were there during dusk and it was such an amazing transformation of the space!",

          "We enjoyed the beautiful water show. The park itself was so nice with different type of water fountains. We took an Uber Pool from our hostel and it was 8 soles for two persons one way . I think the entrance was 8 soles for two persons which we thought was really cheap.",
          "A world class water park. Surprisingly awesome. Well worth a visit at night. Make sure you plan to spend at least a couple of hours.",

          "What a pleasant surprise the water circuit park was! I was expecting 1 musical fountain but was amazed by a park filled with different fountains. Our tour guide gave us a brief background of the fountains which added to the allure. My favourite was the tunnel fountain under",
          "We went there as a part of a tour package. It was overwhelming to see the number of people that showed up. It's located fairly close to the national stadium (not sure if that's relevant) But the water show was amazing-make sure you arrive on time and secure your belongings--it's",
          "Even if we were a small group, it had still a romantic touch, especially as we had some free time to walk around after we've had our guided tour with Sebastian. He did a good job as this park is not only show but also history of several important people back in the past of Lima.",
          "Our last minute decision to attend this $4 sol show was a great find. We got there by taxi from the hotel. The enclosed park was beautiful, clean, safe, had manicured gardens, and offered entertainment at every corner. Two main shows with classical and traditional music and",

          "No rain in Lima for a very long time, but you can still get wet. Took 16 teenage boys who really enjoyed it. We did not stay long enough due to time pressures. Less than $2 per person was well worth going in. Get in at 7.15 or 8.15 for the show.",
          "Visited with several friends. Saw the 8:15 light/fountain/laser show. Lots of people but didn\u2019t feel crowded. Fun 2 hours.",

          "One of the coolest things I\u2019ve seen. If you come to Lima come see this, it\u2019s amazing! It was breath taking.",
          "One of the best things to see in Lima. The gardens are beautiful at night with all the fountains but most people go for the water show to music. It takes about 15 mins standingto watch. The whole park on both sides of the road took us about an hour to walk round. We booked a",
          "I visited the park at night and had the opportunity to see the fountains lit up in colors. The spectacle is fun and would recommend this place for families with kids 100%. I spent around one hour there.",
          "I did not know what to expect when coming here, but it was a pleasant surprise. The 10+ fountains are just amazing to watch and sync with music perfectly. It seems to be a cross between the Bellagio in Las Vegas and the Disneyland electric parade show. The fountains are a great",
          "One hour to explore the fountains and then enjoying the show in the evening is a fantastic idea. If you go in the morning, take a bathing suit and have fun! There's food, dressing rooms, and drinks.",
          "The show was great. Lot of fountains to see - a must to go at night. There are two fountains where kids can play in -plan on telling your kids no or bring a change of clothes for them. There is a kid's play area with rides and huge jumping castles. A few small food stands,",
          "check in advance at what time in the evening the water show with music, film and lights takes place. This avoids having to wait for hours for the show to start",
          "I thoughts this would just be fountains dancing to music but actually was images from the story of Peru projected into the fountains which were very hard to see as they was not well defined it could of been the angle we was watching or the light from all the street lamps, ever",
          "We were with a tour group and we\u2019d all just finished hiking to Manchu Picchu. Our guide recommended we see this display. I went along with the group but I was overwhelmed with the sight and backstory of the park and show. It\u2019s a must see.",
          "Really enjoyed our evening here. Totally amazing fountain displays. Best to arrive just before the show, (7.30pm, 8.30pm or 9.30pm)",
          "People usually leave out Lima downtown area during their visit and hang around Miraflores! I'd Highly recommend going to plaza de armas and the adjoining area - this should be coupled with a trip to this garden of fountains. The light and sound show begins at 7:15 pm, however,",
          "We went here with a group off of a cruise ship, but I would recommend going on your own, so you can take your time and enjoy the park, especially after dark. It is a sizable park with dozens of illuminated fountains, some of which you can frolic in. Several times in the",

          "Visited as part of a guided tour and was overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of the display. Go to the toilet before you go as once you are in you are in. Well worth a visit you will love it but not the after show exit. It's Barney at the best of times in Peru but this goes into",
          "After walking around and seeing each one of the fountains, you can't miss the main show. I went between week, not much people around, 3 scheduled times for the show. Is better if you watch from distance so you can see the 3 \"screens\" on water at the same time (learn that on my",

          "When I walked in, I thought \"Wow, this place is cheesy!\" But I really liked it. At only 4 soles, it must be heavily subsidized. Should be much more expensive. Very cool place!",
          "We decided to walk there from Plaza de Armas and it was quite a walk! However, it was definitely worth it! The magnitude of water, light, music is simply stunning! A lot of ppl but if you disregard it, it's a super romantic place! The show lasted about 20 min and then most of",
          "We enjoyed our visit once we finally made it through traffic. The fountains were all lovely and the show was worthwhile, as well. Unfortunately, we did not immediately catch on to where we needed to stand to see it so we missed part of it. Admission is free if you are 65 or",

          "I enjoyed this so much that when we returned to Lima we went again. On Thursday they didn't have the main attraction because they were upgrading their technology but it is still such a lovely park with fun exhibits and a relaxed feel that it was still worth it. It is very",
          "I didn't have too high hopes for this park after seeing the generally average lack lustre parks around Peru but this took my breath away. This would have to be my No.1 thing to do in Lima. Every fountain is unique and impressive in it's own right. But at night when the place is",
          "This must be the bargain of the city with entry at only 4 soles (under \u00a31) and makes for a really fun evening. The park has around a dozen illuminated fountains some of which are interactive, allowing you to walk through, and some just for show. The centrepiece is the Fuente de",

          "Enjoyed the show. Try to be there at least half an hour before to get the best spots in the middle. However, we were on second row and still able to see everything very well. Nice show, only disadvantage is the lack of good restaurants in the area. Some that are shown on the map",

          "My husband, six year old son, and I visited on Wednesday, September 12. We had a great time! The show was wonderful! I loved how they represented Peruvian culture during the water show and the fountains are very pretty too. The entrance is very cheap - I think it was 4 Peruvian",
          "I went with some family. I didn't like the queues you get to enter, but I guess it's the same all over Lima, anyway, you get different \"stations\" and there's a central show at certain time. I guess it's worth seeing if you have some two spare hours while waiting for dinner.",
          "Nice place , very clean , very organized! People in Peru seem to be very happy and educated, no vandalism ! The Park is normal, the show is cute, nothing much , but entertaining !!",
          "Amaizing place to take a photoshot sesion, for families, couples, quincea\u00f1eras. You need to pay 4 soles each, and if you have a car 10 soles for parking flat rate. Its better at summer so that way you can play with some fountains, into them.",
          "Definitely must go if you have extra night in Lima. The entrance fee is s/4soles. There are many fountains. The music-coordinated with water at 8:30pm and last 30 minutes. Check the show time after you get in. Information has someone speak English.",

          "For 4 soles you can't go wrong really! The place is massive, quite enchanting, great for photos and they do a 30 minutes fountain laser light show from 7.15 every half hour. There are cheap food vendors, burgers and sandwiches are 5 soles and other sweet treats",
          "We were recommended this place by our hotel and it also features in the lonely planet guide book. There are many tours that will take you round but we got a taxi there from miraflores for 20 sol each way which was better value for us. Entry was only 4 sol. There are 12",
          "This is a somewhat out of the way water park but withing the city limits close to the center. It is one of the popular spots in Lima for the general population but very well mounted with a pretty facinating infrastructure. The use of lights and water is outstanding. Worth",
          "We hadn't really planned on visisting but our guide recommended we visit on our way back to the hotel after a day trip. The park itself is lovely but the actual show is superb. The laser display was awesome and well worth a visit.",
          "Very entertaining and amazing light show with the water. Highly recommend this for everyone both young and old. You can avoid not getting wet if you don't want to. Make sure you go at night. In the daylight it is not the same experience at all. The lights all change colors",
          "If you are going with kids, be sure to take towels and 1 set of sandals and clothing extra. Recomended time in any sunny day: 2:00 - 8:00 pm If you are going in couple or group friends, recommended time since 5:00 p.m. until the place is close. If you don't like so much crowd",

          "An amazing show. Fun for all ages, beautiful park. Not just a \"water show\". Incorporated many aspects of Peru through video-like image projections, sounds and unique fountain displays. Go to the early show if possible. Apparently the later crowds are a bit more rowdy. We went",
          "We went on a Saturday night and this did not seem very touristy. There are 3 times for the show. We arrived about 30 minutes before the first show, paid the small entrance fee and made our way to the center of the attraction and luckily found a small spot in the front. The",
          "We found online this was a \u201cmust see\u201d if you only spend one day in Lima. The park is fun to walk through and the show is something but not that spectacular (3 show of 15 minutes on fixed timings). I imagine it is great fun with kids during a hot day.",
          "This looked like a romantic place to me. It is much better if you could come here in the night. I like it so much.",
          "Although this place opens in the evenings once you see the display reflected on the main fountain you\u2019ll understand why you need to see the fountains at night. A great place to go with families or couples.",

          "We booked a tour that included the water show and a dinner show. We went to see the fountains first and were impressed with the number of fountains and how beautiful they were. The laser show was one of the best I've seen.",
          "Tons of interesting fountains, and even a few interactive ones. This would be the best place ever in the summer - to cool down. The fountain show was pretty cool. The best thing about this attraction is the low price - I think it was only a few bucks. Glad I saw this",
          "The fountain circuit exceeded my (relatively high) expectations. The park was incredibly clean and well manicured with flowers. There was a neat variety of fountains. Some were large pools, others allowed you to walk under a tunnel of water arches. The light show included",
          "This is a great activity for visitors. While it doesn't connect to the Peruvian culture at least directly, it's a very unique and enjoyable (especially nighttime) activity. Adults and children alike will enjoy this 1st class collection of fountains and their displays. Entry for",

          "It is a nice park with fountains and lights and lots of locals. Not a bad way to spend an evinced but it is absolutely nothing unique about it. Prices are reasonable. We were there an hour. Felt very safe. One tip is do not hire the taxis at the exit gate. They want 30 soles",
          "The entry fee was only S4 but we got about 90 minutes of entertainment here. There are lots of different fountains, some of which you can go through to or underneath. The lights and music are continually changing, which makes it more interesting than your average fountain.",
          "This is a bit of surprise in a city not particularly well known for modern delights, and in the middle of the desert. But a welcome surprise. Come to cool off or to enjoy the delightful water works, to meet friends or as part of a larger adventure. Well done, Lima!",

          "There must be well over a dozen water fountains, very creatively designed and fun for everyone - walking through a tunnel of water or the dancing fountain where the kids all get soaked. Star of the evening is the laser show, definitely don't miss it!",

          "We had a long lay over in Lima before heading home so we left our baggage at the airport and took a taxi to the fountains. I wasn't expecting much but it was actually very impressive! We arrived just in time for the big multimedia production and then wandered around the other",
          "We took a taxi to visit at night, traffic was very bad but there are more then one show a night and only very cheap entry and free for over 65's. Lots of different water features as well as a main show. Water tunnel worth walking through. Show is around 15 to 20 minutes. Nice",
          "It's a good show but not great, particularly if you have seen others such as Belargio. Much more spectacular at night and a very small entry fee.",
          "Being there, in Lima, deserved to pay a visit to this fountain night show. Isn't as fabulous as their similes in Europe, but worth your time being easy accessible from the close by better places to stay in Lima. Check the schedules for the shows to get there with some time",
          "Nice activity... it is beautiful and well done but the projection on the water is not as awesome as it could be... a little bit amateur ish.... it is big and for 4 soles you can\u2019t go wrong but it is 30 maybe 40 minutes max !!! Nice but it is not a must... if you skip or miss it",

          "You can\u2019t go wrong for a $1 to get in. They\u2019ve made an effort with this place. It\u2019s full of families and couples. It\u2019s a great place for a first date. The water features you can interact with are the best. It\u2019s worth an hour of your time to see.",

          "Went on the recommendation of our Intrepid guide Norma and loved the experience. We walked there and back from the Sheraton. The 15-minute show was a mix of images played on to the water, laser lights and the fountains - this was a colourful extravaganza celebrating Peru. Was",
          "Extremely surprised with the organization and well done presentation of the water show. It was a pleasing experience!",
          "With only 1 night in Lima this was our host's recommendation and it's definitly worth a visit. Not too touristic, nice fountains and how the light plays with the water, not too expensive and nice to enjoy a walk during the evening. We came here by taxi from Miraflores and paid",
          "I spent about two hours (5-7 pm) in this park \"Parque de la Reserva\" to watch the fountains, which are lovely in daylight and even more stunning after dark! The combination of water, music and colours feels magic indeed (cf. the name \"Circuito M\u00e1gico del Agua\"). This is a",

          "The fountain complex is fairly big in size. There are multiple fountains doing all sorts like lasee shows and theres even a fountain maze which is a lot of fun. Expect to get wet if you're braving the latter, dont worry though there are changing rooms. Its a family friendly",
          "A fountain of water and a light show in and around. Many fountains with different lights and music. Beautiful to see in the evening by dark.",

          "This was a totally fascinating and unexpected attraction in Lima. The special effects with the videos projected on the water fountains were spectacular. Free entry if you are \"tercera edad\"",
          "It's a Very emotional experience, a totally must see. The food in the park is also very good, with cheap snacks and chicha. I highly recommend the Labyrinth in the water, one of the attractions there.",

          "We visited the fountains as we were traveling with our kids, ages 8 and 12, but we certainly were not wowed by the experience. The Disney water show is 20 times better, but it was an enjoyable way to spend an evening. It was also very relaxing. Do leave time to visit the vendor",

          "Very romantic place for couples during any time of the day. The crepes were amazing, and I saw lots of couples enjoying the sounds of the ocean in each other's arms. I wouldn't suggest relying on the bathrooms though - not a fun experience (No TP, toilet seat, and the toilet doesn't flush well...)",

        "wiki": "Huaca Pucllana or Huaca Juliana (possibly from Quechua wak'a a local shrine to a protector deity, a sacred place, sacred, pukllana game) is a great adobe and clay pyramid located in the Miraflores district of central Lima, Peru, built from seven staggered platforms. It served as an important ceremonial and administrative center for the advancement of the Lima Culture, a society which developed in the Peruvian Central Coast between the years of 200 AD and 700 AD.\nWith the intended purpose of having the elite clergymen (who politically governed several valleys in the area) express their complete religious power and ability to control the use of all the natural water resources (saltwater and freshwater) of the zone, a Great Pyramid was constructed in the Huaca.\nAs a whole, the structure is surrounded by a plaza, or central square, that borders the outer limits, and by a large structured wall dividing it into two separate sections. In one section there were benches and evidence of deep pits where offerings of fish and other marine life took place in order to attain the favor of the gods. The other section is an administrative area. This area contains various small clay structures and huts made of adobe\u2013with some walls still standing\u2013whose function seemed to be to act as the courtyards and patios of the enclosure which is over 500 meters in length, 100 in width and 22 in height.\nOther remains have been uncovered belonging to the Wari Culture (500 \u2013 1000 AD), which was a direct influence on the Lima Culture society towards the ends of its time period.  Of particular note are the remains of the \u201cSe\u00f1or de los Unkus\u201d (The Lord of the Unkus), which belonged to the first tomb within the ceremonial center to have been discovered completely intact.  This tomb holds three separate burial shrouds containing the remains of three adults\u2013two of which have masks\u2013and those of a sacrificed child.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\npucllana.perucultural.org.pe (in Spanish)\nOfficial Webpage for Huaca Pucllana\nSee a 3D model of the ruins",

          "Large groups of tourists being taken round by a guide so you cant always hear what is being said. have to admit i was none the wiser at the end of the tour around a large pile of bricks",
          "Unfortunately the site itself was closed on Tuesday. However since it was our last day in Miaflora district, we walked to the site anyway, the guards let us take some pictures anyway since we told them that we were going to eat at the restaurant that is right at the entrance.",
          "This is a protected site so you have to go on a free organised tour. The entry ticket price is very modest too and the gift shop is great value. There is also a cracking (fine dining) restaurant here too for after the tour, with views across the site. This is a great find in",
          "I went in the evening for a quiet dinner. The ruins of Huaca Pucllana are lit up wonderfully. The food, while pricey, was very good. A small percentage goes towards restoring Huaca Pucllana, but it remains pricey. You typically need reservations--so be careful and call in",
          "Everyone is familiar with the Incas but the Limos tribe were in Lima 1500 years ago. This site, which was largely neglected for years, was excavated in the early 1980s and work continues today. You cannot just walk the site and take pictures but need to pay the 15 soles",
          "The site itself is worth seeing. You have to know that it's mostly re-creations, which isn't their fault - this is principally due to the site having being used as a motorbike area in the past and thus tearing up the original. What I didn't like, however, is that you must use",
          "The history (what they theorize about) is interesting, but the tour is really too long. You see pretty much the same things throughout and could enjoy it far more on a self-guided tour at your own pace. This isn\u2019t allowed so you have to wait for the slow people in your group and",
          "We were amazed by the setting amongst the Inca ruins but with that said the restaurant did not disappoint. The staff were incredible and knew immediately when we needed anything. The menu has an array of dishes for everyone and the extensive wine list was amazing. The Sommelier",
          "These are very ancient ruins predating the Incas and are worth a visit. We went on a Sunday and had to wait until 9.40am to enter, despite there being no queue, and arriving before 9am.",
          "Interesting place to visit, but too much dust! You are requested to join the group with a guide, which is OK. Guides are knowledgeable.",
          "The location was stunning but the food and drinks just didn\u2019t do it for me. My seafood was very over cooked and gummy.. both the crawfish and scallops. There was nothing special about the menu and I found this shocking with the attention to detail and creativity I\u2019ve experienced",
          "The restaurant with the view of the pyramid lit up at night (ask for an outdoor table) was one of the highlights of our trip. Great food and amazing atmosphere. Tour should have been Spanish & English but just in Spanish. Still got the gist of it. Much is rebuilt. Interesting",
          "Took the English tour, the guide was fluent and clear. The place itself is pretty big and interesting, an ancient archeological site in the middle of the big city. The tour is very educational - apart from seeing the site, it gives you a background about ancient cultures way",
          "We came across this because o a recommendation from our accommodation. For S/12 you get a guide tour of this pre-Incan pyramid and complex.",
          "A lovely piece of history to take in, just be careful to wear shoes and clothes that you don't mind getting dusty.",
          "Very interesting place. If you like adobe brick architecture then this is your place. Ticket prices are very reasonable compared to other major sites. 12 soles for adults. The only downside is that you have to go with a guide and they only leave every 30 minutes. About an hour",
          "A city within a city. This place is out there or indeed in there. Would have been nice to spend a little more time but we were on a city tour.",
          "We waited for around ten minutes for an English speaking tour which lasts about 45 minutes. There is also a small exhibit of artifacts. Half price for seniors! Wear closed walking shoes but gets quite dusty.",
          "It is a very old place that was built by mud bricks many many years ago. A great place to walk around",
          "We were in Lima on an organised tour and only had Easter Sunday to visit. There is a second Huaca in the city but after speaking with our tour manager as to which to visit in our limited time, he suggested Huaca Pucllana as it was bigger and you got a guided tour included. We",
          "Great price nice tour liked the examples of food eaten by the early Lima culture . 1 hour tour included in price good English splenic guide",
          "This was one of the first attractions we went to in Peru, after checking out sites that were closer to our hotel (Parque Kennedy, Larcomar, Kissing statues etc). Doors are supposed to open, but the actual tours didn't start until at least 9:30 so maybe they were waiting for",
          "A very cool place to visit. Our guide was very great and answered all of our questions. The temple was such a site to behold.",
          "Huaca Pucllana is a great site to visit if you\u2019re short on time and only in Lima for a few days. It\u2019s close to the heart of Miraflores so easy to combine with other touristy activities. Having been to Huaca Pucllana many times over the last twenty years, I recently did it with a",
          "I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m reviewing the restaurant or the ruins. The restaurant was amazing. We had several seafood dishes and desserts. It was all wonderful. The setting/location was amazing as well. We were there at night so that the lights were illuminating the temple. There",
          "You can only visit the ruins with a guide. The cost is modest. What was unfortunate was the limited information the guide had to offer. Her English was also limited. However any good tour book fills in the blanks. Couldn\u2019t help but appreciate the labor the pyramids required or",
          "Nice location in a historic landmark with very good food. Beautiful casona. Very good classical ceviche. Try the cabrito and the pavlova to close.",
          "Excellent menu of Peruvian dishes with attentive service, in a unique atmosphere. Huaca Pucllana is worth visiting every time we are in Lima.",
          "Very interesting ruins in the middle of the city. Tour was inexpensive. The on-site restaurant was fantastic for both food and atmosphere, but the service was very slow and inattentive.",
          "Unfortunately, our city tour only included a drive-by of these remarkable ruins. But they were nonetheless impressive. Another remarkable civilization.",
          "Restored and well-maintained ruins in the centre of Miraflores are excellent. One hour walking tour takes you through the ruins for 12 sol. For the price of a latte we learned about the Adobe pyramid and human sacrifices that occurred there. See llama, guinea pig, and corn",
          "A short walk from Miraflores area is an interesting pre-Inca ruin. The tour was an hour walking through the site. Very informative.",
          "Well, It is an amazing site, i have seen some Inca ruins and similar sort of places but this is absolutely unique. The price for adults is 12 Sol. There is a walking tour constantly running in the site which is included in the price. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and",
          "Super cool just to drive by and see ruins popping up out of the city. Even if you don\u2019t stop to walk around it\u2019s great to drive or walk by. Even at night it is well lit.",
          "Lima has a large number of historical ruins, known locally as Huacas, which can be spotted in many neighborhoods. They are generally fenced off, but that is the extent of the preservation. One of the major exceptions is the Huaca Pucllana, in Miraflores district. This adobe",
          "Very interesting place surrounded by houses. The fee is 12 Soles per adult. You have to take a tour (English and Spanish spoken) to visit the site. The tour takes about an hour and is very informative. Definitely worth it!",
          "This ruin is being excaved right inside the modern city. The guide was really interesting, I was amazed at the building of the structues with clay bricks that were earthquake proof.",
          "An awesome site of ruins for just 12 solves a head! Be sure to go with a guide and wear your sunscreen. Very educational.",
          "This pre-incan pyramid (200 to 700 AD) sits right in the centre of Miraflores. The entry fee is 12 soles for adults during the day (9am - 5pm) or 15 soles for a night visit (7-9pm). If you visit at night you can't walk to the top of the pyramid. You get a guided tour in the",
          "PLEASE GO AT NIGHT, this place was magical at night, I visited the place twice and there is no comparison with the night time, the place is absolutely beautiful. The food was great and everything else as well, you\u2019ll spend about 120 dollars, for two people.",
          "Such an amazing archeological site right in the city and they are not done excavating. According to the tour guide, it will take another 35 years to complete the excavation.",
          "An amazing structure to see in the middle of it all. Walking distance to Miraflores Indian Market too. They found a tomb of 4 Chinese men at the base of the structure. There's washrooms and a bougie looking restaurant next to the entrance. Guided English and Spanish tours all",
          "Built per-colonozation and certainly more accessible than other Peruvian ruins Huaca Pucllana offers a guided tour packed with historical facts but unfortunately not enough shade. Currently still in discovery and also being rebuilt in areas one does question the authenticity of",
          "This was a very interesting visit showing pre Inca history for Peru. It consists of a pyramid made of adobe bricks and pre dates the Inca's. Our tour guide did an excellent job explaining how it was built and the events surrounding the structure. There were two small boys in",
          "In a few years it may be worth a visit but at the present time, it is being restored and did not appear to be easily accessible, so you might plan on some place else. The site is large and from outside the fence did not look interesting.",
          "Very interesting place, with an adequate guidance. There is a very good restaurant within the location.",
          "More information then needed. Spent too much time there walking in the sun. The guide was very knowledgable.",
          "Beautiful ruins in the middle of the city.. you can\u2019t climb them though... nevertheless a nice place to visit.",
          "We walked from our hotel in Miraflores. Very easy access and very cheap entrance fees. The tour was very informative and is included in the entrance fee. It was a plus that they were building the platform for the 2018 World Presidents Summit!!!! Very nice ruins in the middle",
          "A ticket for an adult costs 12 soles and has a tour included. You can have one in spanish or in english. During the tour you will walk around 1km and get to know the history of the place and also watch some domestic animals and plants the cultures used. It's astonishing how",
          "It's pretty cool to see these ruins int he middle of the city, we were on a bus tour that took us there but wasn't very far away. There are better ruins in other parts of Peru but this is right in the centre and worth seeing I think.",
          "Worth doing unless you are going up into the Mountains = so many better historical sites to see outside Lima",
          "Since it is in town and not causing you too much trouble to go, it\u2019s worth going . You will spend about an hour in the guided tour by the things you see and learn enrich your knowledge of the culture in Peru. We thought we had seen enough ruins in Machu Picchu and scared valley",
          "We showed up to the normal greeting of is it English or Spanish speaking. The English your talked about the history of the excavations, the future, what the different sites were used for. All very informative. Worth a visit",
          "The ruins of Huaca Pucllana are in a very central neighborhood and they are spectacular since nobody could imagine something so ancient like Inca's ruins could be in the center of Miraflores which is a very touristic neighborhood. The ruins are taken care by the restaurant of",
          "We went here for dinner and the site. The restaurant patio is beautifully decorated. The food is very traditional. Great for a romantic night out.",
          "Our reservation was made for us by the travel company that made our arrangements for our stay in Peru. We were provided with a prepaid meal, Option #3, so we never saw a menu, which I would never do again at a fine restaurant. We were told that there were no patio tables",
          "After lots of Inca sites, this is different- all made of mud bricks. You must use the guided tour (and wait for English..). The explanations were not the best, there were unanswered questions. I am not an archaelogist, but I was suprised, that there is no clear marking",
          "We arrived thinking that a tour needed to be booked but it\u2019s all included in your 12 soles entry fee, which is an absolute bargain! They offer the tour in English and you are provided with all the information you need. Well worth the money spent and the view from top gives you a",
          "It is a really well known place in San Isidro. It deserves to be visited. It is in the middle of a commercial area and history behind it is amazing. Students get discount",
          "A vast mud brick temple, built to withstand earthquakes, dominates the site. Well marked paths allow visitors to explore the area. Guides are available - and very useful - to explain the history, construction and use of the site. Immediately adjacent and with a terrace",
          "Restaurant has some very delicious food, eat at the deck and enjoy the view of the historical site. Price may vary between $8 and $20 per plate.Saturdays and nights are busy, they accept reservations. Ruins are very beautiful and you can still see some archaeological work being",
          "We visited during the day and were amazed at how well preserved this site is. They were also restoring some of the portions of the structure. At night we returned and ate at the restaurant. The site was lit beautifully and the food was tasty.",
          "Visited Huaca Pucllana one morning while in Lima and had a very informative and fun visit at these ancient ruins in the middle of Miraflores. The site is an ongoing archeological project as quite a bit still remains covered by dirt. But what has been exposed and is displayed",
          "Yes, awe inspiring not only by day but also in the nightlight floodlit and adjoining the beautiful restaurant of the same name. Some prior research helped us appreciate what we were seeing. Huaca Pucllana in the Miraflores area of Lima was a pyramidal temple built pre-Inca",
          "We had a very interesting tour of these pre-Incan ruins that lasted a a little over an hour. The guide knew his stuff and was good at answering questions.",
          "It's right in the middle of the city buildings, definitely an interesting place to visit in Lima, the tour had a great guide. Don't make the same rookie mistake I made and bring sun screen and something to cover your head from the sun, it can be very hot during the day",
          "Definitely do the tour, it\u2019s worth it. Went with a group of my MBA school classmates for a cultural project - glad we picked this activity!",
          "On the tour, we walked past some plants that were grown here, as well as a bunch of little sculpture representations of how the Incas made their mud bricks. Saw some interesting bird life as well. It is very big and our tour guides were very informative. I just wish I came while",
          "My husband and I had one day in Mireflores and decided to do this site, walking from our hotel. We were told it would be a 15-20min wait for the English tour to start so we grabbed some water from the restaurant. I admittedly didn't like the tour. It was hard to hear her unless",
          "We visited Huaca Pucllana in March with my Husband and 7 year old son. We had an amazing and educational experience. The ruins are right in the middle of the city which is pretty cool. We learned a lot about the culture of the people who lived there. It was very hot as you",
          "1,000 years before the Incas the locals were building this place using just mud bricks. Many have survived 1,500 years and the addition of moulded copies to fill in the gaps has been done very well. Sol 12 entry includes a guided tour in English. All in all an hour very well",
          "Good and interesting place. Really well preserved. It\u2019s a ruins in the middle of the city, it is worthy to visit it as they will explain all the history of the place and cultures that passed through that temple.",
          "These ruins in the middle of the city look so fake. The foundations are definitely real but the higher you go the more you see they\u2019re restoring it. Looks like a diorama project compared to Machu Picchu. Pretty basic and nothing too exciting. Maybe at night it\u2019s better?",
          "We had only one night to spend in Lima with a French relative who lives there. He invited us for an exquisite dinner of Peruvian specialties (two kinds of ceviche and octopus) at beautiful Huaca Pucllana Restaurante, which is set among amazing 1,500-year-old pre-Inca ruins. He",
          "Certainly a step back in time -- an ancient temple area in the middle of Lima. The entrance fees was 12 sol for an adult. You must walk with a guide in a group. There are English tours if required. You must stick to a specific path. Our guide was good. Plenty of photo oops, but",
          "I made the mistake of going in the AM with no sunscreen....got burned in the fog The tour guide at site was good. Bilingual, as European, Asian, and Northamericans were plentiful on tours. Stay for lunch in the neighborhood....nice area.",
          "This place should be more famous! It is an ancient ruin located in central Lima so you don\u2019t even need to plan a long trip. It has a restaurant that the exterior part is just besides the ruin (huaca) so the view is amazing. Service is great and the food is very good too. We",
          "We had just one day in Lima and since this was walking distance from our hotel, we decided to check it out. It's a cool site. We enjoyed the tour before we walked to the beach and then head to the airport.",
          "I had day off and wanted to see something interesting but didn\u2019t want to go anywhere far - Huaca Pucllana turned out to be the right place for my goal. 1 hour guided tour and some time spent in the adjacent museum was great and enriching experience.",
          "This large ruined Inca temple site in Lima is well worth a visit. It is essentially a huge pile of mud bricks but you can see the extent and size of what was a massive open-air temple. You can walk around most of the site. There is an interesting little garden area where native",
          "We visited the site after visiting most of what the city had to offer. The tour is ok. Up close to site, interresting but was just ok. The construction is quite a feat itself.",
          "If you are staying in Miraflores you can walk to Huaca Pucllana. This Pre-Inca Ruins offer a glimpse into the incredible history of Peru and are a must see if in Lima. After a very informative tour (included in the ticket price), we had a drink and a wonderful lunch in the",
          "We were wandering around Miraflores and kind of stumbled upon these ruins. As you approach you see a huge pile of sand where the ruins have not yet been excavated. We stepped in briefly then decided to return for and evening tour and dinner at the restaurant. The ruins at night",
          "My husband and I had planned to briefly stop by the Huaca for some pictures of the contrast between the pyramid and the surrounding cityscape. We instead took the plunge and paid for a tour (in English). Although we had to wait briefly for the tour to start, we were very happy",
          "unbelievable atmosphere and excellent food. been here a couple times and always want to take visitors. well worth it!!",
          "Very nice archeological place. The entrance fee includes a guided tour that is quite good and informative, if you are in Lima don\u2019t miss it!",
          "Huaca Pucllana is located the Miraflores district in the center of a city neighborhood. The city wanted to put a road through the middle of it. Luckily Lima citizens who care about their history were able to stop the project. Our tour with Sofia Herrera Grimaray from AGOTUR",
          "They accept Credit Card!!! 12 soles per person for day tour. The tour has animals and plants that are native to Peru. Tour guide was a bit dry and lingered at different checkpoints way too long. Interesting site but also made me question what historical things are worth",
          "Ancient pyramid like structure built with adobe and clay bricks neatly stacked with no mortar is amazing . It was built around 500 A.D by pre-Incan Lima culture. It is located in the Miraflores district. We took a long walk to this place from our hotel. Find out the opening",
          "These ruins belong to an ancient civilization that preceded the Inca. You are able to climb some of the structures. I would recommend taking a guided tour of the place which it is found in the middle of Lima.",
          "Historical site in the midst of the city, and after touring it there is an excellent restaurant and bar to enjoy. Lima\u2019s hot summer days make the Peruvian cocktails very much appreciated afterwards with views of the Huaca in the background. Quiet and tranquil.",
          "The Huaca Pucllana site is managed in a highly professional way with all tours escorted by guides (Spanish and English language) who provide an excellent explanation of the site's construction by people of the Lima culture. For us this visit provided an understanding of how",
          "Apparently there are many such ancient mound ruins in the middle of Lima. Incredible to find such ruins in the middle of a modern city. It's made of adobe bricks and quite impressive. Very informative guide, very accessible. Worth the visit if you are in the area",
          "Wonderful to find such an important archeological site within walking distance of the hotel. The restaurant next door was wonderful and it was delightful to be in such a beautiful setting as we enjoyed dinner",
          "This is an absolute must - see right in the center of Miraflores. It is an ancient both administrative and religious complex that was built thousands of years ago, with handmade mud bricks. It was only excavated beginning in the early 1980s, and continues to this date. You are",
          "Amazing amount of bricks and structure. Not bad for in the city, but there are more impressive Inka structures elsewhere in Peru",
          "It's a great place for a bit of easy pre-Inca history which has been found intact and 50% restored . The rest is under what looks like a mud hill. There are frequent tours in English and Spanish but unfortunately found the tour too dumbed down. Could make it much more",
          "We went here to visit the restaurant that overlooks the ruins. You can still see the hand prints from the people who made the bricks. It was easy to get to from miraflores.",
          "It is full of history, but a bit boring. Very interesting for archeologists and history lovers. The hill is an advantage, because there is a nice view from the top. The tour could be more modern.",
          "I've been coming to this Restaurante for years and the quality is always there. Ask for a table on the terrace in order to enjoy the great view on the Huaca. Food is very good and service very dedicated. Will come back soon.",
          "Interesting to see this in the midst of the neighborhood, we didn't tour the ruin, but ate at the restaurant on our culinary tour. Not a reason to visit Lima, but an interesting stop if you have time and are in the area...",
          "English speaking guides are great. If you are in Miraflores you can either walk or take a uber. Very well restored.",
          "Lovely setting and great food. Was a touch touristy as they seat 100+ for dinner. The meal sizes are quite large. I had cerviche for entree and it was the size of a main. A nice experience.",
          "This place is amazing. Getting there seemed a little tricky at first but we took an excellent free walking tour (google fwtperu) and the guide helped us learn how to use the main bus line (the Metropolitano). Once we mastered this it became a lot easier to get around Lima. A",
          "well talk about pyramids this one is huge and for me prior to this trip unheard of but it is massive near the centre of Lima and a must see if you get a chance the entrance fee is minimal the scale of it is massive really just take a few hours and go and see it",
          "This ~600 AD site has been under excavation for 36 years. We have seen ruins all over Peru and in many other parts of the world. This was one of the most boring we have ever seen. The guide had zero personality and no one even bothered to ask her questions because she seemed so",
          "On our way to Machu Pichu we stayed in Lima. A friend recommended Huaca Pucllana restaurant which is located on the premises of the ancient Huaca Pucllana ruins. The restaurant\u2019s ambience is wonderful and the food was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful.",
          "Cheap and central....cost is 12 soles to enter during the day and included an English tour guide. The guide was fantastic and made the whole trip interesting. The ruins are still being excavated in parts and look in good condition. Surrounded by shops/ apartments and traffic",
          "Fancy...didn\u2019t meet our expectations with the food. Maybe bc I\u2019m not a fan of guinea pig. The ruins and informational center were nice. We got there a little late for our reservation, and were told,\u201dnow u vait!\u201d Lol.",
          "This is not my first time, I always like to come back to try the experience. Great service, staff very nice and amazing view from my table outside to the Huaca! I definitely recommend this restaurant to try Peruvian fusion.",
          "Very interesting to see the ruins of a pre-Incan civilization in light of all the attention that the Inca culture/history receive. Interesting to see the difference in the construction techniques and get exposed to these cultures. Our guide was not the best and probably could",
          "We went there for the view of the ruins during dinner, and had a confirmed reservation for the terrace, but when we got there the outdoor seating was closed for a \"Micro Insurance\" convention. Bummer, but what could we do? I had the Loma Saltada, which was good but not great,",
          "Your visit includes a helpful discussion with the tour guide who shows you the areas to visit, within the complex.",
          "Quick introduction to Lima culture (1000years before the Incas) that reigned in Lima. They built the Huaca Pucllaba as a ceremonial square and also the residence of high priests. You\u2019ll have to pay for entrance (12soles for adults) which includes a guided tour. On-site",
          "Great trip around the pyramid site , guided tour with lots of information , take plenty of sun protection & water as the site is all open & lasts for approximately 1 hour",
          "When in Peru this restaurant is a must. The view of the ruins\u2014Huaca Pucllana is one of a kind, the food is outstanding\u2014try the roasted goat and the restaurant supervisor, Brian is a fountain of Lima foody knowledge. This is a great way to while away an afternoon or evening",
          "Try to visit this archaeological gem in the middle of Miraflores district. It is obviously not as impressive as the Inca ruins but just knowing it dates back to the pre-Inca times and it went unnoticed by the Spaniards and until not too long ago was all covered up is",
          "Excellent place to visit and spend a few hours. If you're staying in Miraflores district it's a nice walk to get here, depending on your exact location roughly 20 minutes to half hour. Entrance fee but this includes fully guided tour, English or Spanish. Detailed knowledge not",
          "This site is absolutely amazing when you consider it is over 1000 years old. The history and reclaimation efforts are nothing short of stunning. So much more work to do to reclaim the rest of the site. One can only imagine what hey will find!",
          "Lots of artefacts to see here. Quite a spectacular site When you enter you have to have a guided tour. Worth a visit as there is so much history to appreciate here",
          "Very nice attraction. You must pay to visit though. You will visit with a guide. It is only 45 mins long and you cannot stay there without the guide to take more time to observe. Good guide, had a good knowledge of history.",
          "This restaurant is located within the curtilege of the pre Inca ruins of Huaca Pucllana. Going after dark and sitting outside on the covered terrace is certainly atmospheric, the ruins are illuminated and provide an impressive backdrop for diners. The service is impeccable.",
          "We went twice while in Lima, once on a food tour and the second time on our own. Sadly the tours of the ruins were not running on Sunday nights but the food and service at the restaurant there while looking at the ruins was incredibly special. The restaurant makes the most of",

          "Very interesting piece of history. Guided tours are mandatory and price of entrance is beyond reasonable. Day tours take you up the pyramid while night tours do not. You'll spend about 1.5 hours max if only going to the ruins. Something nice to do if you are in Lima.",
          "A must to visit and learn about Lima's culture and history.",
          "Awesome! Guided in English, excellent tour. MUST SEE!",
          "Interesting historical spot that's worth a look",
          "Very nice place with a Restaurant with good view and a museum",
          "I was looking at what to do my last day in Lima. The owner at our bnb recommended to come and check this place out.  It was very interesting to find this place in the middle of the city.  For the price and length of the tour is worth checking out if you are in the miraflores area.",
          "Worth a visit if you're in Miraflores. You are only allowed in as part of a guided tour (included in ticket price) and expect this to take around an hour. There's not much shade so bring water and a hat if you struggle with direct heat.",
          "So covenient to go. Restaurant is pretty expensive though",
          "Really high quality food and the view of the ruins at the restaurant, some of the best food i have tried",
          "An archeological site in the Lima city",
          "Religious historical places. There is a nice restaurant in the center of the historical Huaca Pucllana. Pisco sour is so good. Yellow potatoes salmon. Corn and cow heart. Guinea pigs food. Dessert Cacao plants. Algarrubina drink.",
          "No English tour guide after 5. The Spanish speaking guide was kind enough to also dub in English at times.",
          "Really great excursion. Worth visiting. Guide is included in the price of the ticket. Guided tours are available both in English and Spanish. New tours starts approximately every half hour. Also at the end of the tour, you can sit in the \u2026",
          "Amazing resto with an even more amazing view",
          "If you are into history its certainly worth a visit, our guide wasn't the best and not particularly engaging but some nice photo opportunities",
          "Good during the day. Wish we could have seen it at night. Nice dogs. Must-see in the area.",
          "You must go!!! The entrance is less than 5 dollars and includes a tour guide... Spoiler alert: you cannot visit the pyramids without tour guide. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a discount for students and teachers no matter the nationality which I think is \u2026",
          "This is a pretty cool place to visit. If you say you are a teacher or a student they accept you without an Id. It seems the guide is hoping to get some tips, but it is an interesting tour. Bring sun screen or a hat because you are outside most of the time.",
          "Pretty interesting archaeological site in the center of Lima. The tour is solid but after a while it becomes just more of the same. Still would recommend visiting though.",
          "Must be with a tour guide when you go, but it's worth the trip. Learned quite a few things there.\n\nTours are provided in English and spanish, free of charge as it's covered in the admission. Don't miss this!",
          "Authentic Lima culture presented by a very nice fluently speaking English tour guide, for free!",
          "An active archeological site, pre-Inca, dated to between 200-700 AD. Its is found in the middle of Miraflores/San Isidro district... not very well known, so its usually not very crowded (which is a plus). Found the included tour very interesting and worth the s/.15 general admission.",
          "We walked here from our Miraflores apartment. The history is rich and the architecture is intriguing. Our guide had excellent command of English and allowed frequent questions and stops for photos. Definitely worth a few hours.",
          "We took a night tour and it was actually much better than I expected. The place is well lit at night, at least the ruins are, and the tour in English was easy to understand.",
          "Interesting archeological site within Lima. I recommend taking a guided tour. Restaurant directly next to the site with a good view, especially nice in the evenings.",
          "Guide spoke English and was very friendly. Ruins were great to see as we still try to understand what happened hundreds of years ago.",
          "I went here on recommendation. I was not disappointed. The restaurant is large with outside/patio seating as well, with the ruins as the backdrop. Great for large groups. The service was great. I think they serviced the best Pisco sour I \u2026",
          "Big history about it. Beautiful place but no need take white shoes..",
          "Great place to learn about and see ancient ruins. They even have two Peruvian Hairless Dogs \"guarding\" the pyramid. This site is huge and the preservation does a great job to recreate the life that existed in this area.",
          "It is an amazing site, i have seen some Inca ruins and similar sort of places but this is absolutely unique. The price for adults is 12 Sol. There is a walking tour constantly running in the site which is included in the price. Our tour \u2026",
          "We had a group meal! Fantastic service for 70 persons.  \nFood was outstanding for set menu and view spectacular!",
          "We ate at the restaurant atop these pre-Incan ruins. Yeah. It was a bit surreal, but the food and service were top notch. \n\nThe breaded crab claws were my favorite single item on a guided 4 stop Lima Culinary tour. They also had excellent juices and cocktails and a decent beer selection.",
          "Very very cool\nWhat's interesting is that this place is still under revival efforts. Highly recommend checking it out if you are in Lima and emsure you make a reservation at the restaurant that is attached to it so that you can have dinner \u2026",
          "You can enjoy this historical spot in Lima. The entrance fee is 15 soles per person. For students it costs 7.5 soles. The guide was so helpful that I could learn a lot about Lima Culture.",
          "Very interested. In real it is  pyramid made from bricks about 1500 years ago. And  not only. It is a guided tour with profession guide who makes the guide separately in English. The is a huge territory with workplaces and harder and zoo \u2026",
          "The guide was very engaging and the site has rich culture",
          "Pre Inca construction is awesome! Visit the restaurant for dinner among the ruins.  With the lighting, it's magical.",

          "The most important archeological place in Lima.",
          "Very impressive pyramid in the middle of the Miraflores district. The view from the top is really stunning. The entrance fee is $5 per person but it does include a tour guide. The tour last for around an hour and the content is pertinent. Definitely a place worth to visit while in town.",
          "Well preserved ruins in the middle of a residential neighborhood,  what a contrast.",
          "Buen centro arqueol\u00f3gico. Merece la pena. It's worth it to visit. It's necessary with guide.",

          "My family and I loved this beautiful place. It's full of history and mystory.",

          "just a place to see old civilization.  guided tour only.   it was alright",
          "Great archeology Attraction!!, The nightly tour is also a very appealing",
          "Whilst on a guided tour during the day, our guide casually mentioned that we should check this place out as we drove by it. My word, it was the highlight of Lima! We loved it - amazing tour which costs next to nothing. For the best part of \u2026",
          "The place is well kept and the touring guides know a lot about the subject. The animals kept however are totally unnecessary. If the Incan people can be shown by dolls, so should the animals. The cages are super small and the animals have 0 \u2026",
          "Very knowledgeable guides. Wear sunscreen and a hat.",
          "Amazing place in the middle of Miraflores. I recommend visit it and support the research. The guides are very friendly.",
          "The place is very nice and the guided tour is just great and helps a lot to understand what it is.",
          "how can i go there from  Plaza de Armas - is there any tour company i can contact / or i can take a taxi to there / and are they open all the day and every day ... pls",
          "This is a great place to visit if you're in the area. The tour guides are very knowledgeable, and are easy to talk to. You also have some nice views while touring. The only detriment is that about 40% of it is reconstructed -- but, this is to be expected with a 1,300 year old structure.",
          "Historic archeological pyramid temple complex. Included in price is a 45min tour (English/Spanish) with nice explanation and a small botanical garden tour",
          "Tours are a little long, but deffinetely worth the visit",
          "Big archeological site in the middle of the city with a very informative tour.",
          "Large pre Inca site, made up of millions of mud bricks.",
          "Location and service are incredibly good... waiters and host do a great job, and the view  and 'ambiance' at the terrace are incredible. Food could be better though... it's an average high-end taste... which is good... but will definitely \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning energy from this place. Make you want to sit in the corner and just soak it in.",
          "First place I ate at in my recent trip to Peru. Fantastic food and such a beautiful place to eat at.",
          "Tour guide was not able to contextualize the grandeur of this museum/archeological site. Quite disappointed actually as it should have been spectacular.",
          "Worth taking the time to visit. The tour is about and hour. The tours during the day are in English or Spanish. Our guide did a great job. If you are hungry the restaurant is very tasty (see separate review)",

          "Very well organized tour, very impressive to see a ruin in the middle of the city. Highly recommended!",
          "...made our way there from our hotel which was approx 30 mins walk, the main entrance is in Elias Aguirre Street, not in Calle General Borgono unless you want to go to their restaurant. entrance fee is 15 soles each (\u00a33.50). there is then a \u2026",
          "The place greatly improved since my last visit in the early 2000\u2019s. Tours bring the structure to life. Nice and cute farm and garden. Very exposed with little shade; bring a hat!",
          "Very commerical. Food was average. Lima has better options for tourists. Service was poor",
          "Amazing place with a lot of history and demonstration of building architecture. It says there is a mini zoo inside, buy you can visit it only in the day.",

          "Incredible work by indigenous people .So sad so many other places were destroyed by the invading Spanish",
          "These ruins were absolutely stunning and still quite intact. There are parts that are still being excavated, and therefore blocked off, but we were really able to get a picture of how the pre-Incan civilizations - like the Lima and Wari \u2026",
          "Some of the oldest ruins from Peruvian history, take a peak into the traditional sacrifices and ceremonial traditions. highly recommended when in Lima, But it\u2019s no Machu Picchu. Staff are great will gladly answer any questions you have and offer Spanish and English. One of the best places to hit up in Lima for travellers.",
          "It is one of the old place, this place also called as temple.",
          "Fine. Guided tour only. Not super interesting. About an hour long.",
          "Bottom line up front: Don't overlook this place.  Awesome spot to visit if you find yourself in Peru. The tour was cheap. $4 USD to be exact and lasted about one hour. Tour guide was funny and kept the crowd entertained while informing at \u2026",
          "Very interesting.. had no idea about the pre Inca history until I visited.  English tour was great and included in entrance fee",
          "Very nice ruins in downtown Lima. Worth the visit Interesting guided tour which is mandatory and lasts about 1 hour.",
          "A very interesting expierience in the heart of Miraflores. You have to buy the ticket, but the guide is free and they do have English speaking guides. The place is closed on Tuesdays. Definately worth visitng if you're in the vicinity. Asside from the temple ground they have a selection of Peru animals and endemic fauna.",
          "A your guide was obligatory and rather boring. We skipped bail half way",
          "Good experience, but maybe not worth its own visit but a sure thing if you are in the area.",
          "Good tour, the guide spoke good English.",
          "Very interesting place!",

          "Nice archeological site with well run tours. Note that tours are mandatory. You cannot walk around by yourself. Mayan sites are probably much more impressive in general but this is a great place to spend a few hours. Ticket booth closes between 1 and 2p for lunch...",
          "Great food Archeology Site",
          "Worth a visit, while in Lima. Entry fee includes a guided tour, with your choice of English or Spanish. Bring water and a hat, because you'll be outdoors for around an hour.",
          "This one of the key places to visit in order to have a better knowledge about Lima's prehispanic history. You can have a guided tour both in Spanish and English. Last but not least there is a restaurant on the site which serves Peruvian and international food",
          "Really cool but rhe tour drags. Great to learn about limas and the culture 200AD!",
          "Very interesting site in the middle of Miraflores. Entry by guided tour only, but these seem to be regular (in Spanish and in English). Guide was knowledgeable and happy to answer questions. Bring sun cream and water - there is no shade around the site!",
          "Awesome restaurant, greart and delicious food, great ambience...",
          "I loved this little archeological site in the middle of the city.  With the entrance fee comes an informative 45min-1hr tour.  The government doesn't help with the site so it's all run by tourism money and donations.",
          "Fun restaurant location.",
          "Well preserved, family friendly",
          "I suggest to visit it during the day, in the night the price is almost the same but you can't see the whole building",
          "Interesting tour with very informative guides. It's very close to Lima so can be done without too much organising. It is very reasonably priced with a gift shop at the end if you need to pick up something remember the visit by. There is a restaurant on site too but I can't comment on that as I did not use it.",
          "Great adobe and clay pyramid, the guide was very informative!",
          "Highly under rated place. This is a must if you are into pre Columbian civilizations. This site is older than machu pichu",
          "Traditional food with beautiful views of the ruins. I've had better food in other restaurants in Lima but it's a classic spot.",

          "Great tour, loved to learn about the history. Right in the middle of Lima.",
          "Nice, 45 min tour included in ticket, price 15 Soles. Guide was really quick although her English was good. You cannot walk by yourself",
          "Located in the middle of miraflores is a pyramid like structure that gives a sense of history when you are in it. You can learn about the incas way of living and experience first hand about it... The only thing i did not enjoy was the language skill of the guides, a a little less jokes and bit more practice and it will be awesome.",
          "If you like history, it's definitely a must go. Loved it",
          "Nice museum, but small, with good explanations in Spanish and english.  Walk up the pyramid  is easy  and gives you a nice view of Lima. Unfortunately you do not get to go inside the pyramid.",
          "Very interesting short tour and visit to a ruin in Lima.",
          "Beautiful site. Not expensive entrance with very good and nice guide. The view from above is also great. Totally worth it the experience. Not accessible for disabled, tough.",

          "Interesting site. Tour guides are rude. 15 soles to get in.",
          "I've never been to an excavation dig site that you can also have an elegant dinner on top of. The place is a favorite of Indiana Jones, I hear",
          "Tour guide included in the ticket price, 15soles/adult. Learn a lot, recommend.",

          "Very impressive site and amazing",
          "They were very accommodating! We went during the night; during the day you get to go on top of the ruins and see all the animals. \n\nDuring the day they have English OR Spanish tours, during the night they can do bilingual. We showed up \u2026",
          "So much history at this ruin, do the guided tour here. The end of the tour is what will make it worth it",

          "A beautiful place and a very enthusiastic guide passionate to explain Lima culture",
          "Amazing!! the English guide was great and cheap. We tipped our guide which wasn't essential, but we felt he deserved it. Lunch at the restaurant was great although it was a little pricey compared to other places in Lima, it was definitely worth it.",
          "Nice place to go and discover more about the local people, about the Incas, about the culture.",
          "The service was exceptional and enough servers spoke English to make it easy. They have all of Peru's traditional dishes, prepared very well. Great wine list too. Can't say enough about the views. Huaca Pucllana lit up at night looks spectacular.",
          "Good",
          "Interesting place. It is possible to see all from outside.",
          "A great place to visit while in Lima and to learn about the Lima culture. They won't let you wonder around by yourself since it is an active archeological site. Be prepared to wait for a few minutes for the tour to start. The tour guide will take toy through the site and tell toy about the history of this place",
          "Certainly a step back in time -- an ancient temple area in the middle of Lima. The entrance fees was 12 sol for an adult. You must walk with a guide in a group. There are English tours if required. You must stick to a specific path. Our \u2026",

          "Nice to see the contrast of the big city and the ancient ruins",
          "It's cool.  It's historic.  But it would be nice if the tours could be a little faster or if they allowed you to go at your own pace. Still interesting and worth the visit.",

          "A really wonderful pre-Incan history and site!! Didn\u2019t know it existed for the longest time, and right in the middle of Miraflores as well! Definitely worth a visit in any tour of Lima, especially at night as it\u2019s much more magical. Free tours are offered with admission.",
          "Pre - Inca civilization with 1 pyramid...",
          "Huaca Pucllana is an interesting pre-Inca archeological site right in the middle of the city of Miraflores in Lima,  Peru.  I was astonished on the millions of adobe bricks needed to build this structure.",
          "Great open-air museum to learn about the Lima culture and their customs. The visits are guided, both in English and Spanish and they last about an hour. There's a little zoo where they keep alpacas, llamas, and guinea pigs, locals call them \u2026",
          "Good place to visit, the guided tour shouldn\u2019t take more than 45 minutes. You can only enter with a guide, bring sunscreen!",
          "Great ambiance and great food!",
          "Super interesting site, the guided tour was a bit sparse on details but still worth the visit. Take some protection from the sun though, very little shade.",

          "Huaca Pucllana was good but if you have been to other pyramids and visit Museo Larco in Lima, I wouldn't recommend going here. It is repetitive to some extent as to how pre-Incans led their life.",
          "You can enter for free for a short 5min look, very interesting",
          "I loved it! The site is beautiful it's definitely a must go to site in Miraflores",

          "Ok. I have seen ruins before",
          "It\u2019s something you should see in Lima, but nothing too special. The tour is kind of useless to be honest. But it does offer unique views of the city.",
          "The experience is a bit simple, but it's a must-do in Lima. If I'm not wrong, you pay PEN 15 (about $4) to enter the complex and get a 40-minute guided tour, in English or Spanish. It's not thaaaat fascinating, and you should bring a water \u2026",
          "A pre Inca ruin in the middle of the city, where can be spent a half day. There is a worthwhile guided tour, which goes through a very small zoo, a botanical and finally the ruin.\nUp. Very easy access..\nDown. There are sites which are still under restoration.",
          "Excellent place. From service to choices to flavors and even to prices. With such views you'd  think it's highly expensive  and it is affordable  expensive :) Depending on where you come from it might even be very good value. \nBut totally \u2026",

          "A must see place in Lima. Guides are nice",
          "Enjoyed the visit. As mentioned hot with little shade but worth the visit,  very interesting that it has been hidden under dirt for so long in the middle of the city.",
          "Nice place but too much dust and the sun from Lima can cause you a sunburn very bad to the skin. Take with you an umbrella before you go. It should be covered with trees or something. Also watching the people eating there in a vip \u2026",

          "A piece of untouched history in the city - delicious food at the restaurant",
          "Great 6-7 century historical site. There is an ongoing effort to uncover all the ruins, but what is shown is worth it. Takes about 1h30, the sun is quite strong and there is little cover, so bring headgear. Admission is 12S (about 4usd), and the sights make it worth it.",
          "Excellent site, ask for Ricardo, great guide",
          "Great guide. These place gives a good prespective on how the people of the Lima reigon used to leave in the 2-6 century. The architecture is uniqe and special only for this site. Recommend for antropologists",
          "Expensive and not that interesting. Save your money for Cusco and the markets around lima",
          "Interesting ruin and archeological site located in Miraflores. Small price to get in and then a guided tour available both Spanish and English. Shines a light on the history of Lima before the Inca's, which is really interesting along with their religious practices and daily life.",

          "The fact of ruins in a metropol alone is astonishing, but the ruins themself are quite interesting. The local government is aware of running excavations and secure the site, it's for tourists available with a guide. Our guide told us a lot \u2026",
          "Easy pre-inca \"trail\"\nConvenient location \nGood tour guide",

          "Ok",
          "We found this place by accident we were actually going to the restaurant that is across the street from this one which is an Italian restaurant that I visit every time I go to Peru, but this one caught my attention because there was a lot \u2026",

          "Fab site in the middle of Lima, was only a 20 minute walk from the hotel",
          "Ok",
          "Food was pretty generic. I wasn't too impressed. The entire time I couldnt tell who our waiter was, each time someone approached the table it was someone different. Really uncomfortable. Nice view.",
          "Ok to visit, but english guide was hard to understand because of the strong accent.",

          "Great save 1km track for jogging",
          "Interesting place to visit and learn about the earliest history of Lima. One point we took away: If doing the tour of the pyramid in the got months, apply sunscreen generously and/or take an umbrella - 30 minutes in the sun at noon can be a challenge.",
          "Try the night visit and dinner at the restaurant after.",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area - easy to find & S/12 entry with a guided tour. It is only halfway through the excavation, would be interesting to see it complete in 40 years time! \nThere is a restaurant on site, which I \u2026",

          "Enjoyed the meal.",
          "I wished I had read the review before going to this site. Since I am in Lima with local, I did not bother researching, which resulted in rather disappointing experience. When you walk in, you have to wait for a guide. You cannot roam alone. \u2026",

          "Very educational stop and must see when in Lima",
          "Interesting historical site to visit while in modern Lima",
          "If you are in Lima - make your way to Miraflores to see these ruins.  They really give an interesting peespective of the people of Lima.  Seeing ruins in the middle of a large modern city is pretty cool.  You will get dirty, so dress for dust all over your shoes and pants.",
          "Brilliant!",

          "Must see if you  are around!",

          "Not much to see. Guided tours.",

          "This can definitely be missed if you don't have time or care about history. Still very interesting to see how Adobe mud bricks were made and millions of them form this flat top pyramid. The tour isn't that exciting, seems very scripted, \u2026",
          "Pretty cool historical site",
          "This historical site in Lima has a rich history. It was occupied by several ancient civilizations.",

          "Fantastic food and a great view! Definitely a good place to go.",
          "Huaca is a beautiful archaeological site in the heart of Mira Flores in Lima. 12 soles is the daily entrance fee and 15 soles for the night fee. ~4 USD per person. A guided tour is mandatory in either English or Spanish, comes part of the entrance fee, and is quite informational. ",

          "This church had interesting architectural features you can walk around and enjoy, and walking through catacombs is always an interesting thing. But it wasn't particularly amazing. We also were part of a group guided tour, and our tour guide was both very quiet and fast talking",
          "This church is a must see! It's located in the old historic part of Lima, and it contains beautiful arts and catacombs. Be careful in this part of town though. It's safe in the church, but pick pockets are a thing on the streets around here. You will see a large police presence,",
          "Take a guided tour, we\u2019ll worth your time and money. Still a working convent, although in a smaller scale. They have a fantastic collection of over 20,000 books that are just wasting away because nobody is taking care. The humidity is slowly destroying this treasure of books,",
          "We spent a short time walking around the inside of the church. If you are near it, go inside to see it.",
          "There are many , many churches to see in Lima. This is one not to miss. It's huge, it's decorated differently, it had a convent, it's old, there are catacombs, it was run by a religious order. Notice the red/brown color schemes, very different then the overly gold leaf",
          "We went to Lima just before the Easter period and on the first day of our visit we visited this monastery. It took only 15 sols from our hotel at Miraflores to reach here by Uber taxi. Lima was developed by Spanish in 1535 as Cusco was far away from sea and this church was built",
          "This was a fascinating old church to see. I believe you have to have a guide which is included with the entrance fee. There was some previous complaints about some of the guides ability to speak english. Our guide was excellent. The depth of history that was explained to us was",
          "we visited with spanish tour, as to wait for english tour it was another 2 hours. The convent is nice, although i expected the part with bones to be a bit different. if you are on short time you could skip this.",
          "This place is absolutely gorgeous. It was fascinating to see the history of this building. The library was beautiful and the catacombs were a unique site. No photos allowed inside and it cost about fifteen soles per person but it was one hundred percent worth it.",
          "Mary was a very knowledgeable and interesting guide who took us through this convent with a fascinating history. The artwork and the architecture is certainly worth the visit. As is the visit to the catacombs.",
          "Closed due to protests when we got there. Sat outside and admired the architecture. Many children playing there chasing the large flock of pigeons. Well worth the visit.",
          "Iglesia de San Francisco is a big church like many others you can see in Lima (as Santo Domingo, for example). What really made a difference for this church was the included tour, where it was explained everything about the church and included a visit in the tombs behind the",
          "Has many old interesting murals and paintings. I found it eerie seeing the catacombs. The bones exhibited there are all femurs and skulls. Need to be careful not to bump your head as some of the underground paths are not very high. Our tour was around 3pm and it was crowded.",
          "Happened to be in Lima on Good Frieday and some roads were closed around the historical district. We decided to go inside the Iglesia San Francisco and experience the local special holiday. Inspiring! I also took the tour of the catacombs and convent. It was educational and",
          "Large church, busy. Catacobs underneath containing the remains of +/- 25000 persons. Mostly femurs and skulls. The catacombs are open to public. Church itself is also sorth visiting. Vibrant square in front of ghe church. Be sure to walk around 200m boyond ghe church for a",
          "This old convent is placed in the old part of town, but it is not original or restored properly. The afresco walls are plastered and painted over, the library is in horrible condition (to be restored). The catacombs are interesting, but if I were given a choice, I would not",
          "We went with 3 kids under age 9 and managed to catch the free English tour. The guide took us through the Franciscan monastery and it was fascinating to see the library and the huge choir books made out of lamb skin. The underground catacombs also enthralled our kids.",
          "Our cab driver brought us here. It was very nice to see. The statues and architecture around the door is unbelievable. Glad we saw it.",
          "This is a must see site if visiting Lima. We visited the catacombs as well. It was crowded due to a local holiday.",
          "This is a beautiful church and interesting for a visit. They only had one English tour guide the day which made the wait a little long before the tour could start.",
          "The church is nice. The spinach style courtyard though is beautiful. There is an amazing library in one of the buildings. It is filled with antique books and manuscripts. The library was my favorite part of the visit here.",
          "Very nice experience. Beautiful church. Love the history of the colonial period. The art was impressive.",
          "The church is lovely, well maintained, and in the basement has the most amazing catacombs. Now if you are claustrophobic think twice about getting inside, but otherwise the catacombs history is so interesting, there is a guided tour for adults and children. I can tell you my",
          "While the side above ground is a nice monastery and church with interesting enough pictures and architecture but nothing that remarkable, the underground is pretty interesting as the skeletons of the victims of an earthquake have been deposited here in a very picturesque and",
          "It was a wounderful church with great wood work on the inside. Be sure and look where the high ranking church members would sit lining the way to the alter. The wooden statues above the seats have been cavered to look like the member who would sit there!",
          "It is really interesting, the history, the view, the place around. We paid for an internal tour to the catacumbas and it was incredible!",
          "This church, monastery and catacombs have a lot of potential and a lot of paintings but it seems no one is investing in anything there. Our tour guide was an older woman with black curly hair that spoke mediocre English and was pretty quiet for a guide. We were rushed from one",
          "Where to begin... English tour with bad english language and low volume so only the old lady can hear herself speaking, no photos (I paid for it, for all I care, I should have the ability to videotape it if I want), bad shape of everything due to humidity, horrid odor of",
          "We were lucky enough to be the only two people on our tour inside the monastery. It really is well worth a visit . The crypt are respectfully preserved and the choir room is magnificent. Our young guide was very knowledgeable and it was clear that he loves and respects the",
          "Now it is called a convent and Tom always considered the term Convent was related to female religious \u201csisters\u201d, but all the pictures appeared to show Franciscan friars (men). \u2022 A little religious background for Lima = When Francis Prezaro captured the town of Lima, he set up",
          "I am always amazed by these monasteries. The paintings, the interiors and the chapels. At one time this monastery housed 100\"s of monks, but now less than 30 remain. Definitely, a must stop on any visit to Lima, Peru.",
          "Has many old interesting murals and paintings. The catacombs are very interesting. The bones that you see are all femurs and skulls. Need to be careful not to bump your head as some of the underground paths are not very high. Place has some interesting exhibits too.",
          "Wow this church with catacombs underneath and an amazing library is a unique place! PHOTOS NOT ALLOWED TO BE TAKEN! Garden is beautiful and all the artefacts inside are one of a kind! I highly recommend!",
          "The church is beautiful and the cloisters are a tranquil haven in the city. The paintings and Athens hidden murals are fascinating. We had a tour guide with us, so helped explain the history of the Franciscan monastery and the church. The catacombs however, even she struggled",
          "The tour around the San Francisco Monastery costs 15 Soles for adults and includes a 30 minute tour with a bilingual guide that explains its history and stories of different parts of the building. By far the coolest part is the ancient library which features books and scrolls",
          "We stopped here during on our full day tour of Lima. The church itself is quite beautiful, and dates from 1620, and there are many be wonderful examples of the architecture of that time. The catacombs beneath the church make this visit different from the othe cathedrals we",
          "We visited this church as part of our tour of Peru. Our guide showed us the neat artwork - eg the scene of the last supper with Jesus and the apostles eating Guinea pig and with dogs in the painting. But the nearest part is seeing the crypt with all of the various bones",
          "As another place to know in the center of Lima we came to this church and we didn\u2019t get disappointed. The interior of the church is beautiful. My husband and my son enjoyed it very much!!! They got to feed the birds, they bought stuff people sell and enjoy time with people.",
          "The church and convent are not only architecturally significant but the inside and the catacombs are something to see while in Lima, Peru. The catacombs are wonderful and yet eerie. The choir was singing while we visited and the acoustics below in the catacombs were perfect.",
          "This is a beautiful church and monastery we visited late afternoon so it was daylight on arrival and dusk when leaving so we got to see it illuminated and it truly was beautiful. I would say to anyone who is visiting pay the 7.00 sols to enter so you can appreciate the religious",
          "If you want to tour the catacombs (and other facets of the church) you have to be on an organised tour - either English or Spanish, but the times aren't promulgated anywhere - they just tell you at the desk the time of the next one. You're unable to take any photos of anything",
          "Very beautiful, quiet, historic, and a truly spiritual haven for rest, prayer, or meaningful tourism. The religious artwork is stunning wherever you look. The mixed/baroque architecture just embraces the visitors and pilgrims with a hospitable journey into theology through",
          "The place proposes guided visit (in spanish in my case) included in the entrance price. Every single room of this place is gorgeous. Furthermore, the guide was speaking a very understandable spanish.",
          "The church is free to tour around, but it is worth paying a little extra to go on the catacombs tour. There is an English and Spanish tour offered. You walk through the catacombs plus take a guided tour of the convent. Very interesting.",
          "Entering as part of a tour was flawless, as was our access to most of the church. We were not rushed, and the guide was very thorough. Well preserved, lots to take in.",
          "I took at tour of the Monastery and was impressed with its grandeur and scale. Our guide spoke excellent English and was very well informed. The catacombs were a highlight.",
          "You will see the skeletons from old times. Compared to the big/fancy churches in Europe, this one is small and simple. Yet, you can always find peace and calm inside.",
          "It's an interesting church located in Lima's historic centre. The highlight during the visit is the catacombs system. However the guided tour is too rushed. Is forbiddeen to take pictures during the visit.",
          "This church is one of the most popular churchs in Lima, we went to this church with a group of friends, it was very interesting, there is a guide for toursits that speak english and other for tourists that speak spanish. there is a zone where there are many bones located at the",
          "How about that for a different experience! If you\u2019re in Lima, this is a must see. It is estimated that 25,000 bodies were \u201cburied\u201d there. The catacombs served as a burial-place until 1808. The catacombs were rediscovered in 1943.",
          "take a tour and see the remains of the conqueror apparently he was misidentified until the 70s when he was discovered during some renovation. this really doesn't seem like a church",
          "You may only visit as part of a guided tour - there are no times published and we wanted an English tour, luckily there was one going in about 5 minutes. I don't know the usual frequency of English language tours however so be aware you may have a wait. Cost of the tour was 15",

          "The catacombs are very interesting to visit if you've never done a tour like it before. I was kind of expecting a bit more, as the tour was quite brief. The courtyards of the cathedral are very beautiful, I'm not sure if they're open to the public now but when I visited in",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral worth seeing. We waited 15 minutes for our English tour. The tour itself was much too rushed. Our tour guide was not bad with her English however still very hard to understand as she dropped all of her last consonants. For the price I wish we could",
          "At first I didn't had many intentions on going, but I found a really good guide to lead the tour. To my surprise and even when I'm not that attached to church anymore, I found this very interesting, beautiful and amazing how so much can happen in a so confined space. simply go,",
          "Great place to visit if you are interested in historical or religious sites. The catacombs are great if you are looking for an instant way of confront in your own mortality. The monk library is also really impressive, it's a shame most of the books have gotten to a really",
          "Really beautiful church. Special thing to see is the crypt with the old bones. It's best to have the tour. There is one in English.",
          "As we were walking up Av Larco from the beach, we approached Kennedy Park. As we approached, we thought this was an old abandoned church, but upon a closer look, realized it was still in use. It looked as though it had just had a fresh cleaning, and was all concrete colour.",
          "The tour I was able to take within the Iglesia was very interesting, and definitely worth the time. Great history here. I wish I had had more time to spend here.",
          "We\u2019re not religious people but the information and collection of antiques, original artwork and catacombs in this museum were amazing. It was like travelling back in time. Pity photos are not allowed. The architecture was stunning and the inner gardens very relaxing. We visited",
          "Wither on the city tour or on your own this site will wow you with its story\u2019s and history. Make sure to walk through the Catacombs and also take a moment to stand in the square and take it the facade and also the pigeons that seemingly fly in unison around the square. Won\u2019t",
          "Lots of Moorish decor throughout reflecting the history. An expansive site with garden, courtyard, catacombs, chapels aplenty, intricate design features and murals. Well worth taking a tour.",
          "The $5 fee to tour the building and catacombs is well worth the price. The site contains the bones of over $25,000 people in the underground catacombs. The building houses done very impressive artwork and woodwork. No photos allowed inside.",
          "I visited Lima with some friends to enjoy the gastronomy and architecture, one of the most popular sites was the convent of San francisco, i wanted to visit this chuch many years ago because it's one of the most important in Peru. the day that we visited this church there were",

          "This is still a monestery and only a small section is for tourists. The sad part is no photographs. The visit includes the catacombs with artistic displays of bones, the library with beautiful Gregorian chant books in vellum and then the choir. There was a small shop with",
          "Too many school-aged children making noise during the tour, especially in the catacombs. Next time I would go early in the morning - the mid-day crunch was almost too much. The art work and craftsmanship of St. Francis is breathtaking.",
          "Partner and l recently visited the Basilica and Convent of San Francisco in Lima. Underneath the convent there is an estimated 70,000 people whose bones are on view. The convent is over 500 years old, but the catacombs were only discovered in 1943. The library is stocked with",
          "I sold my sons on a visit to this church by telling them about the bones they'd be able to see in the catacombs. I don't think they were disappointed! Of equal interest to my husband and me, however, was the beautiful church, with woodwork and murals, the open",

          "Entrance is 15 pen per person. This is well worth it as tot get an english tour for about 1,5h in the convent and the catacombs. Taking pictures is nooit allowed but you will het plenty opportunities to do so anyway.",
          "I'll be honest, we came for the catacombs, and that's the part we most enjoyed. The rest of the visit was interesting, and we had a lovely guide, but the best part was definitely going underground and seeing the bones!",
          "The Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was our first stop in this area. The impressive Moorish and Spanish designed church, the largest of its kind in this part of the world, dates back to 1673 and has survived several earthquakes, making",

          "Beautiful building and artwork with fun/interesting crypt to visit. Like everyone said, one can only enter via a tour. Hubby and I went in the afternoon and were lucky enough to be the only people needing an english tour. It was really nice to have the guide to ourselves, and",
          "Well real monks still live there, no photos allowed. If like bones, you get a kick out of this, lot of them. Narrow catacombs, cool place",
          "The Monastery is a great alternative to look around especially if it is a special day and the locals are queued up to enter the church as they were when we were hear. Inside the monastery are works of art in terms of the architectural finishes such as the Choir area over",
          "The tour is required for the museum and catacombs. It's interesting but also crowded - there are multiple tours going on at one time, and the guides talk loudly of course so it can be disruptive. Still with a visit, you spend about 45 minutes going through the museum and 10",
          "Historic art effect and beautiful architectural buildings are mesmerizing. This church was beautiful and retained its luster after several hundred years of wear and tear.",
          "When I visited the Plaza de Armas, it was closed off by police for some reason, so I wandered listlessly until I found the Iglesia de San Francisco. The tour was awesome. The old library and the choir and the catacombs were highlights. Look out for the skeletons!",
          "We visited as part of a tour group with a professional guide. The church was so full of beautiful things to see in every corner and alcove. The crypts are pretty creepy but they are interesting to see. There a few signs so a good guide is needed.",
          "We went to visit center of Lima and I wanted to see the cripts under the convent, it is very creepy, rssss !! the cathedral is very impressive by its size and ornaments, looks like they have a lot of gold everywhere! It is worththe walk around!",
          "Ok to visit but probably overrated by the guide. We visited as. Part of our tour of Lima and spend about 20 minutes here.",
          "A must see in Lima. This is an impressive landmark of well-preserved colonial architecture in Lima\u2019s historic centre. The catacombs are the best that I have seen outside Europe. Entrance includes a 45min guide tour in several languages",
          "Beautiful convent! We went as part of a tour through historic Lima and this was by far my favorite place. If you are Catholic, San Martin de Porras and Santa Rosa de Lima are burried inside the church. Nevertheless, the place is beautiful, it has a library to die for; not to",
          "You can only see it on a tour ($5). The tour part was ok - the guide didn't offer much beyond what was on signs for when you probably didn't need the tour. The library is amazing - architecturally and the collection of severely deteriorated books. The catacomb part of the",
          "This and the Cathedral are two of the must see places in Lima. This one is most notable for the catacombs. As noted only guided tours are allowed here. The old paintings and frescos are very nice and the building is historically interesting. Going underground is a bit",
          "A must visit in Lima. Needs a guide. Apparently the library has a rich content of old texts from all over the world.",
          "The next stop after plaza de armas and just when you have seen the best you are found to be wrong. What an outstanding church that had me gobsmacked. You can not visit Lima without seeing this beautiful building",
          "You can book a leading tour to see and hear about the history of the monastery and see the onderground graves with bones. Lots of old paintings are in the monastery, some of the very old. You cannot go by yourself and you will have to wear decent clothes, because it is a church",

          "This was the best thing we did in Lima. Entrance fee was 15 soles and you get a full guided tour of the monastery and catacombs with lots of information on the building and artefacts, daily life etc. Well worth a visit.",

          "The church complex includes a number of buildings including the adjacent catacombs which you can pay to go through, but we only visited the church with its very interesting exterior details and its magnificent interiors. Certainly one of the places n Lima to check out.",
          "The church itself if really beautiful and you should visit it when visiting Lima but the must go is the tour through the tombs! The tour is always guided and you have the option to wait for a English speaker guide. You can't take any pictures, but that is good because you can",
          "This is a Franciscan church and they unfortunately do not allow to take pictures inside. I actually visited the site through TuriBus, it was really great. Catacombs were basically a graveyard (which is still active, but those areas are off limits to visitors). Very educative and",
          "The tour of the catacombs is pretty spectacular. It's dark and cramped so be prepared. I would have liked a little more written information on what I was seeing, but the tour guide was helpful when I asked. The church is gorgeous, as well. Too bad we couldn't take photos.",
          "very impressive collection of art, architecture, and the catacombs rival anything in Europe. They are a little claustrophobic after being in them for a long while--- low ceilings but very well lit and lots of folks in them at once.",
          "This was a beautiful church to visit, the tour was good and the archetecture was amazing. It was fun to see and not just for the crypt.",
          "This place is worth visiting. It is full of history and interesting facts. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared if you are claustrophobic as you will be walking in small underground tunnels. The basilica is located one block northeast from the Plaza Mayor. The church and",
          "Normally I do not like tours of churches, etc, but this one turned out to be fabulously informative and interesting. Especially the tour of the burial sites in the catacomb basement. Tour guide was very knowledgeable.",
          "Interesting church. The architecture is classic Peru. Got a few good photos here and was glad that I was able to stop in. I would recommend it if in the area.",
          "This church is very lovely. The tour is not to be missed. It has beautiful old artifacts, old vestments on display. The catacombs are not to be missed. Scary though for very young children.",
          "An inside tour was included with our bus tour (which was disappointing) and we liked but not being able to take even still photos was a big disappointment. I am torn because I did enjoy our visit but quite negative about the ban of still photography.",
          "I have preferred the Santo Domingo monastery In San Francisco no photo are allowed Interesting catacombs",
          "Beautiful church and catacombs. Watch out for the low ceilings in the catacombs. Make sure you buy you tickets early and arrive ahead of time if want an english guide",
          "Catacombs under the ground, historical place with lot of information. Will not take the whole day to go through, so you have time to do other things the same day.",
          "This church and old monastery are worth a stop. Beautiful architecture and art pieces surround a gorgeous garden. But the true reason to go to this place is to visit the catacombs where several thousands of monks were buried. If you are scared of real skulls and bones, skip",
          "This church is very typical of the old churches in Peru, but this one stands out because of the extensive catacombs. Your tour includes going down into the catacombs and seeing the burial sights and bone collections. Some of the passageways are tight, so if you tend to be",
          "We have the chance to visit not only the church, chorus, colonial art but also the catacumbs. Impressive",
          "A visit to the San Francisco Convent is a must. There is a small fee to enter the Convent (which includes the catacombs) but the church is free. I suggest you do both! The church is amazing and free but closes from 12-1 for a service. The tour of the catacombs is worth it. Tours",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect when we visited the San Francisco Convent. Our admission included a tour in English. The tour guide was good but did a poor job speaking loud enough and clear enough for all guests to hear and understand her. The church is amazing. It's in",
          "Loved the church although our guide was not very helpful. The Library was very special, would have loved to have gone inside. Catacombes added interest to our visit.",
          "We visited as part of a walking tour of central Lima. This is an impressive building with some lovely if somewhat spooky relics",
          "Just did the San Francisco Iglesias tour today. Had no idea the S/15 would get us a full guided tour of the museum and the catacombs. I just expected entrance. Had a great guide who did our tour in English. He explained so much about how everything in the museum came to be.",
          "The church itself is beautiful and ornately decorated with many beautiful altars featuring typically Mary and various saints. However, the thing to visit is the catacombs. Unlike the church, which is free to enter, the catacombs have an admission fee, and you must enter with a",
          "The catacombs, basilica and library undoubtedly deserve the praises. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say that about the guide. She was in a rush, did not give us time to observe things. It seemed that she does not like english speaking groups. The pigeons outside were flying",
          "Go just for the garden, with the beautiful plantings and the many, many birds singing. I'm not much into catacombs, so I only toured the very first part and then left (all those bones!), but the gold-leaf covered saints in the sacristy were very impressive as were the various",
          "Not only the church is beautiful but you also get to tour the catacombs which is rare. Pictures are not allowed anywhere and it is a well guided tour.",
          "It was an interesting tour, but it was a wait to get started because the tour begins whenever enough people are seated waiting inside. So, be patient and know you won't be given a specific tour time and may need to wait. If you can speak Spanish, it's a slightly shorter wait for",
          "You are taken round by an English-speaking guide. You get the catacombs with skulls and bones - but a whole lot more. Beautiful religious architecture and interiors from the colonial era and a fabulous dusty old library which looks like it has been frozen in time. I would have",

          "I visited this church. It was amazing with the morrocan style in the decorations, the ceilings, the antiquities, the catacumbs, the altars, the floors. The paintings the tiles on the walls, all morrocan style. It was my first time in catacumbas and was a great experience. The",
          "We have visited the catacombs of the monastery and this is a very unusual journey. Old red bricks, lots of bones of victims of inquisition, all this makes place a bit scary but very interesting to visit.",
          "Superb building, location, great showpieces including the catacombs and church windows. Enjoyed immensely.",
          "The S. Francisco church, and museum is very interesting place. you will never forget multiple skulls and corps, along with the gold paint covered altars, sculptures, and paintings",

          "We really liked the tour and it was pretty cheap. We waited about 15 minutes for an English tour. We got there not too long after they opened based on others reviews. There was a school field trip going on so otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have been too busy. The tour guide was very",

          "Allow to wait up to an hour for the English tour, so ask when the next tour is when purchasing tickets. It is certainly worth a visit to see the library and the catacombs.",
          "We visited the convento and the catacumbas. The church in the convento and the place where the choir goes is impressive. The librarian brings you back 100 years. Outstanding. Nice visit.",
          "Only Sol 15 for a tour which is well worth it. The building has been restored & renovated to something close to its original glory. Fabulous rooms, murals and a Harry Potter library! The Catacombs are of course excellent. No photographs allowed sadly",

          "Enjoyed the tour of this historic place and catacombs. 5 spanish speaking tours went ahead as we waited 45 minutes for an english speaking guide so please be prepared if you are short of time. Catacombs are very erie and in my opinion, human skulls should not be displayed like",

          "This is a beautiful cathedral in the old town section of Lima not far from the main plaza. It is worth a visit to see the interesting catacombs and the beautiful construction. Got to peak inside the cathedral after touring the convent section. Most photos are now restricted",
          "started our Peru trip on Lima old town and the splendor of the old spquare surrounded by government buildings and historic old town streets and colors - a contracs to Miraflores - both a must see",

          "This cathedral is such an important part of Lima's history and is a must see. Unfortunately it could use some more restoration and preservation. The \"Harry Potter\" library is beautiful but the books are deteriorating badly. The catacombs are fun to see (and a little creepy).",
          "This was interesting. I have done the Catacombs in Paris and this one is very different. Not as creepy. You can do a tour in Spanish or English or wander around on your own. I was really annoyed however because I waited 50 mins for the English tour to start, to only be told an",
          "I enjoyed this walking tour of the cathedral. Our guide was good and knowledgeable. The thousands of skeletons were a unique aspect of this tour. It apparently was a mass grave cemetery from many years before. I also enjoyed going through the catacombs. No photography.",
          "This is a beautiful church that we saw with a tour guide. Having the guide was beneficial to add context to what we were seeing. You can always walk through a building, but to understand the significance of areas in the church go with a guide. Of course the catacombs will",
          "Do the tour! It's well worth the admission and there's a lot to see and learn. The catacombs are cool too, but I personally preferred seeing the rest of the place.",

          "Visited this church twice 3 years apart and was still amazed at the architecture, art and history behind this place. Catacombs are a must see. The tour guide was also still the same lady - she is very knowledgeable and passionate! Ask lots of questions!",
          "This visit was great. Included in the admission $5 US was an English speaking tour guide. Although the group was large, he had great information if you kept up and paid attention. You get to see the catacombs and some very impressive woodwork as well as the gorgeous tiles",
          "Great guided tour. Unfortunately we had to wait for an English speaking guide but the neighborhood is beautiful to walk around. Go behind the church to see ruins being worked on and fountains popping up along your walk.",
          "The catacombs under the monastery contain 100's of bones, mainly skulls and femurs, as the rest have disintegrated. They are displayed in patterns, are very dusty and not very gruesome, though I am pleased they are not my ancestors, as I think they are treated with disrespect.",

          "We arrived here and joined another traveler on an English guided tour. The tour was probably only 30 - 45 minutes and our guide moved us quickly between areas but was happy to answer any questions we had. There is a great deal to see within the grounds here - paintings, the",

          "Historic church which is well worth the visit. We did the tour which is about an hour in which there is an explanation of the churches history, you enter into a library with books from hundreds of years ago and you also walk through thr catacombs.",
          "This gorgeous convent and church gives a great view of the history of Spanish Peru. The catacombs, while not for the claustrophobic, are well worth the visit.",
          "The church itself could be in a better condition, but it is impressive and worth knowing the catacombs. If you suffer from claustrophobia may not be the best, but it's interesting to do the tour. There are parts of skeletons from the Inquisition of the Catholic Church. Even",
          "The convent and its catacombs was the first stop on our tour of Lima. Waited 15 minutes for an English speaking guide who provided excellent narration of the history and features on display. Numerous religious artefacts and paintings, furnishings and a lovely library housing",

          "This museum is an architectural gem. There are beautiful frescos, huge arches, even an old library still full of books that are hundreds of years old. The catacombs were cool to see but very creepy. I wouldn't recommend touring that part of the church if you're claustrophobic or",
          "This is just a beautiful church - from the butter yellow outside to the very cool red and white interior. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Highly recommend going with a tour guide to explain the significance of the church. They take you into the catacombs below. No pictures allowed inside.",
          "Beautifully ornate church and side altars. Catacomb tour was very interesting. Very close to central plaza and shopping",
          "Another very interesting religious site. There are catacombs which are well worth seeing under the monastery and also the library with books going back to the 1500's (not in good condition). The hall with the saints in is fascinating as it leaves no doubt as to how they died.",
          "The experience in visiting the Monastery is definitely worth it. The library and the catacombs were the highlights, but the Church and main square were also interesting.",
          "St Francis seems to be a popular Saint in South America, and I came across several of Cathedrals dedicated to him on my travels (eg, La Paz in Bolivia). But this one, in the historical section of Lima, is very impressive. And it's operational - on the Friday night that I went",
          "My wife and I visited the Convento and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Lima. When we arrived we waited a few minutes for the next tour. There are separate tours in Spanish and English (and presumably other languages). There were about eight of us in the English",

          "Our friends and family recommended this tour and it did not disappoint. The old library offered a beautiful look into the past, while the bones and skulls in the catacombs satisfied our taste for mystery. But best of all, our tour guide, perhaps only in his 30s, just seemed so",
          "We loved the tour! It is so worth to visit! The guides can speak different languages and extremely friendly. Fascinating history. First time we've got to explore underground catacombs and they are pretty impressive.",
          "We went on the tour and it was fascinating. To actually go down in the catacombs and observe the bones was fascinating. It was a well done tour.",
          "The San Francisco Church and convent, as well as catacombs, are a very special place for me. My grandfather had a flat there, which overlooked Jiron Lampa and Ancash (streets). I often used to stay there on weekends when I was an impressionable 6 years old. The church fascinated",

          "Included in the 15 Sole ticket was an English tour (only 5 people in the group- I think we lucked out.) our guide was informative and willingly answered all of my questions! This place was incredibly cool! The monastery is still functioning & the catacombs are super cool",
          "lovely old convent in Lima. Gives a wonderful sense of Lima's past. Easy to walk around both inside and out.",
          "To see the underground catacombs filled with human sculls and bones and to hear the history of it all is definitely worth the visit. The rest of the tour of the church can be a bit long.",
          "Very interesting visit. Definite change from the traditional church tour. From the extensive paintings in the courtyard to the catacombes.... a well worth trip. Tour buses do a quick stop, but I would suggest a slow tour to see all there is.",
          "So as travellers we can all become a bit tired of churches and tours. However if there\u2019s one not to miss it\u2019s this one. A guided tour in English delivered by Ruth energetically and passionately describing the world of this building of over 400 years. From the organ to the music",
          "Don\u2019t expect ancient monuments or very old buildings in central Lima - most were only built in mid-1800s. This monastery has some parts which go back to the mid-1600s so bit older. Tiles in the monastery are interesting.",
          "This is an amazing venue. Straight away you can feel the history of how this building came to be. Very similar to Spanish designed cathedral which is no surprise given the history of Peru. We were lucky to be there when the church was holding mass HInt: local guide is best,",
          "Pretty and picturesque but not the most amazing church I have seen. Pretty common architecture for South America but it's interesting. Most of the gold in here is just paint and it loses some of the awe compared to other places",
          "beautiful site with lots of history, inside you will find a quiet place with many information to learn, from the pre-revolutionary era after Spanish conquest, here you will find the famous Catacombs, with real bones in display, very interesting, also you will visit the beautiful",
          "This is an important stop while in Lima. The site is beautiful and historical. I am not sure what else to say.....",
          "Not really one to appreciate churches or religious buildings but I was really impressed here. In such a busy area, the calmness and quiet inside was amazing with such beautiful garden areas. The history side of the tour even impressed me and the story of their Patton saint",
          "This beautiful convent and cloisters will take you back several centuries to the art and devotion of the pre-revolutionary era after the spanish conquest. The bones on display in the extensive catacombs give mute testamony to the many souls cared for and interred here.",
          "Very interesting Moorish architecture and tombs. The tours are very informative and the plus is that the tour includes one of the oldest libraries in the Americas.",
          "If you are into history, architecture than it's a place for you. Catacombs are little gruesome when you realise how many bodies were buried there altogether but its worth a visit and learn all the history and stories, Watch your feet and heads while walking there :-).",
          "Make sure to check out the Moorish decorations in the church as well as the library dating back to the 16thcentury and the gardens. They also have 3D images of 3 of Lima's saints....Santa Rosa, Martin de Porres, and Juan Massias.",
          "Take a tour in English and appreciate the many lovely features of this site. The catacombs are a bit morbid but a worthwhile visit!",
          "The church is located in the central part of Lima. It is a 17th century monastery complex. The high light is the library with thousands of ancient books. The yellow and white baroque exterior is imposing and majestic. The main church inside is gorgeous. The tiles made in the",
          "This monastery is still being used. The building itself is worth seeing. It has an interior patio with 5 fountains and lots of roses. The monks live on the side that is not open to the public. It is being carefully restored and you can see where they have peeled centuries of",
          "This is a good example of a new world baroque church.. Built by the locals for the Spaniards and the newly converted. This church demonstrates the power and wealth of the Catholic Church in the 17th century. Most of the structure has survived several major earthquakes - a",
          "I am a big fan of churches, cathedrals, this place has a lot of history but I did not like much the way it is maintained. So many colors that don't match. The library is so full of dust and the books seem to deteriorate fast. Not much security and therefore lots of things can be",
          "We took the guided tour which was included in the price of the ticket. The library, with the original old texts, the various decorations and rooms, and the catacombs were really interesting. The guide also provided alot of interesting information. Worth a visit.",
          "This was an interesting visit to the catacombs and we learned a lot, but the traffic to get here was terrible...so don't feel bad if you don't make it that far!",
          "During the tour, you get the highlights of the Monastery, but the highlight is the catacombs where thousands of corpses have been dismembered in order to fit and have the honor of being buried beneath the church. Seeing the bones and skulls of so many people was perhaps a bit",
          "This is definitely worth visiting. It is interesting and the architecture is stunning. It is a nice quiet retreat from the business that surrounds it.",
          "My family and I visited on 12/31/17 to see the catacombs, but we were lucky enough to arrive during a mass. I took a seat in the back and followed along as best I could. The activities of the mass were a little different than here in the US. Many women were cleaning and",
          "My wife, daughter and I wanted to quickly peek through the catacombs, but this was not an option. You are required to take a guided tour. Though reluctant because we don't often do guided tours, we decided to go for it (tours in both English and Spanish). The catacombs were",
          "Beautiful buildings and surroundings with plenty of history. Lots of photo opportunities. Lovely serene garden in the midst of the city chaos.",

          "An excellent church. Just a beatiful structure. The only drawback is no photography allowed inside. Great catacombs and lovely alcoves.",
          "The church is huge... the library was really interesting and enormous. I liked this bit the best. The family tree painting at entrance to catacombs is interesting. Catacombs weren't that exciting.... not like the ones in France or Italy. The bones are displayed in groups of",
          "Iglesia y Convento de Sam Francisco is a church located approximately 2-3 blocks away from the Plaza Mayor. If you like wandering in to historic buildings and churches, you will find this to be worth a few extra minutes of your time. The building is rich in history and worth a",
          "For the mere prices of 10 solos you can have a guided tour by a local whose English is pretty good. Warning: no photos or videos to be taken hence I have none to attached apart from the outside of the cathedral. This place reminded me of parts of Spain with the beautiful mosaic",

          "For 10 Sols, this 45 minute tour was worth it -our english speaking guide kept on track to cover an enormous amount of history. We weren't as interested in the catacombs(bones) as a lot of people must be but the library, staircases, refectory, court yards, gardens et al were",
          "it's crowded and it's messy... bathrooms inside awful. (dirty and stink) The only positive thing is the architechture itself.",
          "Beautiful church in centra Lima, still in use, very visitor friendly with nice anchient decorations inside",
          "Pretty historical ceremaic tiles and colonial style building. Rich artworks and history. Some underground historical burial artifacts and bones found under the church.",
          "One of the highlights of every visit to Lima. A beautiful \"Anden Barouque\" church, great cloisters and of course the unbelievable catacombs! More than worthwhile.",
          "We all must remember that Per\u00fa was NEVER a 'colony', it was a viceroyalty which means legally it had the same status as mainland spain but as it was split from it geographically it had a Viceroy as the king could not be present himself. If it had been a colony it would have had",
          "We visited the Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco as part of a four hour open air city bus tour we took with Turistour. We were all in complete awe with the age of the Historic Church and fantastic collection of priceless art contained inside. We were given an English speaking",

          "Colonial architecture in Lima. Made into a museum. Sit around the plaza and people watching. Feed the pidgeons",
          "Visited with our friends as part of a tour bus, Mirabus! Very interesting for all ages, not something you can just see anywhere, it is very unique and one of a kind location and sites! Staff was very helpful and kind as was our tour guides from Mirabus!",
          "A beautiful well preserved and maintained Spanish Colonial church and convent from the 1600\u2019s. Interesting area of catacombs down below. Great exterior and interior decorations and furnishings.",
          "A space that breathes history. Guided tours are offered in English and Spanish and is included in the price as you are not allowed to walk around alone. We had a great hour long tour explaining the history and art of the place. I especially liked the library and the catacombs.",
          "We got an English guided tour around the Basilica, which is the only way you can see it. Plenty of artwork to be admired, and the crypts are a wonder.",
          "In my opinion, San Francisco church is the most beautiful and eminent in Lima. If you take a tour \"Lima by walking\", you should definitely see it. I have not been inside but even from outside it looks impressive!",

          "While no pictures are allowed, we enjoyed an hour long tour and being a former funeral director was interested in the catacombs. The walk through thousands of bones and the reasons for them being there made this tour memorable.",
          "The beautiful library of the old monastery is directly from Harry Potter films. Unfortunately you cannot take photos there. The catacombes under the church are rather big, with some bones.",

          "Stopped by at around 7:18pm, paid the small fee and waited for the 7:30pm tour. The tour was in Spanish, so I did not understand what the tour guide said but there were a few descriptive signs in English inside. Even though I couldn't understand her, the place is really",
          "This convent is a must see while you are in Lima. It is at a walking distance from the main square. Most city tours will have this convent as a part of its itinerary and with good reason. One of the grandest convents in Peru for sure, the majesty of the architecture will humble",
          "We took a taxi across town to visit the Catacumbas but were very dissatisfied with the very rude guide, yes he spoke English but he rushed us through the tour skipping many features on the way, there were 5 of us in our group who at the end all had the same opinion. We soon",
          "The only way to see the convent and catacombs is by guided tour. My husband and I took an English language tour, which seemed to be offered relatively frequently. The tour guide was very knowledgeable, though she did speak very quickly. She was very friendly though and was more",

          "Exceptionally beautiful church with wonderful side alters and a special ceiling. Open all day Sunday we think.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting San Francisco. There are many interesting areas to see with beautiful artwork and architecture. I loved the catacombs as well, which really added to the experience. I would definitely return on my next visit to Lima.",

          "Interesting. The catacombs are definitely worth the trip. We combined it with a visit to the Catadral (where Pizaro\u2019s remains are stored) and Plaza de Armas. We did not do as a tour. We just grabbed a taxi from Miraflores and spent the day there.",
          "45 min tour of the catacombs is worth while. There is so much to see in the convento and it is perfectly located just blocks from several other prime sights to visit. I highly recommend.",
          "We came here at the recommendation of our travel agency, and it was a nice place to get in touch with the history of Peru. The only downside is I felt quite rushed and they would not allow any pictures inside whatsoever. The architecture and ruins are so beautiful it is hard to",
          "who in the world though it was a good idea to have a guide in english who BARELY speaks any english in a low pitch voice more annoying than audible... never again, what a bad guide for such an interesting place....",
          "This place looks amazing from outside, but inside is even better. Suggest to take a tour as you will learn more and see more with the guid. For us it was the highlight of Lima and number one attraction. We learned a lot. The library inside is amazing, unfortunatelly no cameras",
          "Visit of the 'catacombes' underneath that church was definitely the best sightseeing we had of the downtown Lima. very impressive reconstitution done by archeologists that captured the essence of this burial site, by bone size and type.",
          "Part of our tour of Lima and all its sights, impressive. If you get the opportunity and have enough time it is well worth a visit",
          "Fascinating catacombs. Beautiful cloister and artwork. Required to go with guide, but a guide who speaks your language will be provided for you upon paying the admission...you just may have to wait a few minutes. We didn't know that ahead of time and so we were a little confused",
          "Colonnialism is the matter. It is a very representative convent of Spanish intrution in America. Great place to spend an afternoon after some ceviche.",
          "As part of Gate1 tour this was given quite a bit of time and it was certainly impressive.It dates back to the late 1600's affording an architecture one would find in Spain.What to me was impressive was the convent library and the catacombs. We were not permitted to take any",
          "Visited as part of a city tour and found it amazing place. Spectacular library and architecture. Catacombs full of skulls and bones and amazing frescoes and artwork in the main building Well worth spending a couple of hours here",
          "Stunning building with secrets. Worth a visit with a guide for all the history. Make sure you have time to soak it up. Maybe not for young children. No photos allowed downstairs.",
          "Definitely a must-see when in Lima. It's just a few minutes walk from the Main Square and offers very frequent guided tours in both Spanish and English. I felt the tour was much more restricted than some of the other churches in the center of Lima - you're not allowed to visit",
          "The San Francisco church and convent provides a great example of the status of catholicism in Peru after it was conquered 1532 by Spain. On one hand, I was struck by the beauty of opulent spanish tiles in the convent then how influential spanish made large for financial",
          "The church is typical of the many Catholic Churches in South America. This has a Franciscan Monastery attached and catacombs going back hundreds of years. Ther edd are bones that have survived th edd years and catalogued into types. Skulls and leg bones on display. Excellen th",
          "The catacombs were impressive, the library incredible! If you get a chance to take a tour do it because it will be worth every penny! LOVED IT!!",
          "Beautiful church with interesting catacombs. The ceilings have a Moorish influence and the library is absolutely awe-inspiring (with authentic ancient books). This site was better than I expected and definitely worth a visit.",
          "We turned up at 5pm on a Sunday without any prior booking and was able to get an English guided tour around the church and catacoombs. It was the guys first English tour and he was excellent. Library was cool and the catacombs very interesting. They don't compare to the ones in",
          "I'm not a big fan of churches, however this was part of an organised trip and I was very glad I went in. This building houses some intricate woodwork, an impressive library of large and ancient tomes and a basement level open grave area where you can view literally thousands of",
          "So worth the 10 soles that also gives you a guide in your language of choice. Tour was about 1 hour and the catacombs were interesting.",
          "We used Sun Gate tours while in Peru. One of the first places they took us on our tour of Lima was the Convent of San Francisco. The Convent of San Francisco is located one block northeast of the Plaza Mayor in Lima. It is constructed in the fashion of sixteenth Spanish",
          "This was really an interesting tour and we really enjoyed it. The catacombs were neat to see too. If you are in this area yopu must visit here!",
          "I visited the monastery and the catacombs with an excellent tour guide who explained the history of the Franciscan Order in Lima, the art work to be seen everywhere and the architecture of the building. We had a walk through the catacombs which were a burial area. A very",
          "I visited the San Francisco church because i wanted to know the famous catacombs, the tour was intersting but i was a little afraid beacuse the catacombs are located unted the basement, i saw a lot of bones, in addition there are other spaces to know like the library thet have a",
          "We really wanted to see the catacombs, so we paid for the tour. Lots of restoration happening, which is great to see. Incredible paintings and interesting history. The library was pretty amazing.",
          "What a display of architecture surrounded by an artsy park. In the heart of all the shopping and restaurants. I loved taking pics in the place.",
          "We did the tour of the building and participated during the mass. Apparently there was some kind of festivity or special day, because it was packed and some areas there were no place to stand either. Would be better to go on a quieter hour so you can enjoy the beauty of this",
          "This was part of our city tour and we were amazed at the wealth and history displayed in the church. I am still unsure as to how I feel about the catcombs and the display of the human bones therein. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "Our visit was with a tour group which really did not allow enough time for us to really see and appreciate the convent. Certainly worthwhile to visit the catacombs but regretably our group could not go into the upper church with a service in progress. Unfortunately photography",
          "Inexpensive and has a remarkable library right out of Harry Potter. Also, the catacombs are very interesting with bones from 25,000 bodies all stacked neatly by bone type. Also area surrounding this has lots of shops and restaurants. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "You cannot go to the historic center without visiting this couvent. Guided visits are organised at different times of the day in english and spanish and last 45 minutes aprox. It is quite a huge building and the wood work is impressive. One part of the visit takes place in the",
          "We visited here as part of a tour. There is a beautiful cloister with some amazing silver artifacts that are used for ceremonies. However the highlight of the visit were the catacombs. There are incredible displays of bones from the thousands of people buried under the floor.",
          "The church of San Francisco is a good example of Spanish Baroque in the Colonial Americas. The central and side naves are painted in a mix of Spanish and Moorish style. Impressively the main altar and the choir-stalls on the gallery that are completely carved out of wood.",
          "The church is noted for its architecture, with granite carved portal and a totally wooden altar. The most fascinated is the convent's library possesses about 25,000 antique texts, some of them predating the Spanish conquest. You have to visit this library! Catacombs contain",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect what the tour started but walking in the monastery and catacombs was really exciting. Our guide was knowledgeable and the inside of the monastery is stunning! it's definitely worth spending some time here.",
          "A visit to this church is like a visit to large churches in Italy, in that the architecture and arts within include many different styles and symbols. And yet it is different, with the brilliant colors of Peruvian history, the paintings and sculptures representing important",
          "Very interesting tour (can get English speaking guide) and beautiful church and grounds, but the tour seemed rushed, and passed by many things that we would have loved to hear about. The library was gorgeous and the age of the books awe-inspiring, but it was a little weird to",
          "I didn't go into the church so this review is only for the catacombs below. The English-language tour was very informative and fascinating. It gives an overall background of the Spanish presence in Lima and their relationship with the indigenous people. There is an impressive",
          "We visited this on a one day visit to Lima on our way back from the Sacred Valley. They offer guided tours in English and Spanish and they are extremely informative. This is a 16th century Franciscan monastery with catacombs. Beautiful architecture and fascinating history. Worth",
          "Quite close to the Plaza Mayor - the centre of Lima, the Church is a nice looking twin tower structure with a baroque style yellow facade. There is a small square with a fountain in the front. Right beneath the church houses catacombs and underground passageways where you can",
          "Do not miss this incredible place. Pay for the tour which will take you into the catacombs, where tens of thousands of people were buried in quicklime over the centuries. The skulls and femurs and phlanges are all arranged perfectly--to remind your of your own mortality. This",
          "Probably one of the most ornate churches I've seen in a long time. So much gold leaf and many 'chapels'. Worth a visit.",
          "This beautiful old cathedral is definitely worth a visit. Interesting architecture, beautiful interior, nice plaza in front. I recommend.",
          "A must go if you are spending a couple of days un Lima. The convent is beautiful but of course the catacombs are the real star. They offer guided tours in Spanish and English for nothing except a voluntary tip (you shouldn't be stingy though, our guide was really knowledgeable",
          "In front of the central park in Lima, the wonderful architectural design and beautiful decoration of the main cathedral is really a must do",
          "The tour of the building was interesting, but I found the catacombs to be incredibly creepy. They have organized all the bones by type and laid them out in patterns. Its very strange. It was interesting to hear about the history, but the catacombs were just too creepy for me.",
          "Great aftenoon visiting historical downtown Lima and San Francisco church and catacombs. Super interesting not recomended for claustrophobics.",
          "Had the most enthusiastic guide give wonderful stories and history of the various parts of the catholic Cathedral. Lots of birds on the towers outside the church. Surprisingly, there was a vulture inside the cathedral (one with wings)!",
          "Rich 15th century Spanish architecture. Outstanding interior, front main altar, and balcony choir room. It's what's below that's really interesting, the catacombs, with display of bones and layout.",
          "Even though I am not Catholic I enjoyed the tour of the convent for its historic art and architecture. If you are not claustrophobic you should visit the catacombs to see the many human bones kept here.",
          "nestled just one block from the Palacio de Gobierno was the Convento de San Francisco. We entered to see the one thing, which was the cross that San Martin used to carried when he fought against the devil. It is placed above the staircase above his sepulchre. Also underneath",
          "Wonderful artistic and historical testament to the Franciscans whose presence over the past five centuries is showcased now for all to see. Visits are restricted to group tours, however they alternate between English and Spanish so there is sure to be a venue appropriate for",
          "The Peruvian churches are all magnificent and this located off the Plaza de Armas is one of the crown jewels of the city. Take a couple hours to wander the church and see the magnificent expression of faith.",
          "We really enjoyed the actual church as it is beautiful and historic but we were required to take a tour with a tour guide and it felt very rushed and the guide did not welcome questions. The catacombs is an interesting part of history but again, perhaps it was our tour guide or",
          "Didn't particularly enjoy this site. You are required to pay and go with a tour group at particular times, so plan accordingly. The English speaking tour guide, I don't recall her name, didn't speak English very well, spoke softly, and often while gesturing about the room and",
          "One of the first stops on the tour of the convent is a 5000 year old library which is so surreal it appears to be a set for a Harry Potter movie. Some of the books on the shelves appear to be so old that they might fall apart if anyone tried to read them. The art work and",
          "Although our guide had a lot to share, he was so soft spoken and spoke in a monotone which greatly detracted from what he had to share. Got to see the version of the painting of last supper in which guinea pig was served on table. Had the guide presented better, this would've",
          "Really nice and luxury monastery. Going to catacumbs were really unique expirience! For 10 soles, we could pass underground tunnels, see in locus fossils, graveyards and really nice places. We recommend!",
          "This church is so beautiful. It is easy to get to. There were lots of places to see nearby. Photo opportunities abound.",
          "This monastery from the 16th century is a breather treasure. We were with a guide, in a group and my only complaint is that we were ushered through too quickly; next time I vomit will be with a private guide. The building itself is impressive, in size and ornamentation, but the",
          "The catacombs are amazing. The library, cloisters and various other rooms are impressive too. Well worth the mere 10 soles entry.",
          "I believe it's around s/10 to take the tour. They take you through the whole church, showing you the courtyard, the choir room, and where the monks had lived. The architecture was absolutely lovely, and so very intricate. After the tour of the church, they take you through the",
          "This was my favorite part of Lima. The basilica is gorgeous, and the rest of the church that you see on the tour is equally beautiful (note - to see the full church and catacombs, you must go on the tour). The tour guides are extremely knowledgeable, and will tell you about all",
          "This is a beautiful and historic church and it houses the remains of Francisco Pizarro. It's a must seeQ",
          "We were ther first thingn the morning, and they provided a very nice tour throught the ibrary and catacoms. It is worth taking this tour!",
          "Church itself is not really amazing despite good. There are more interesting ones to visit. But the underground worth the visit if you don't have any claustrophobia.",
          "small entrance fee. must wait for guided tour. overall, very interesting place. great art and history behind the pieces. the catacombs are really eerie and super cool to see. there is a church right next to the museum that you can go into as well.",
          "The tour takes about an hour and is worth the time and effort. It is an interesting piece of the colonial history of Lima and the power of the church in history. The catacombs are interesting, but just as interesting is the artwork and history of the place.",
          "Enjoyed looking around this beautiful building and the creepy catacombs! Interesting tour, took about an hour.",
          "The tour was short and sweet and we saw the bones. All a bit sad, thinking about the people that would have been buried here but seems a very big part of the city's history. It was cool inside too!",
          "The catacombs underneath the church are impressive, but you cannot enter without a guide, and cannot choose a guide either. We went with Victor, who was yelling at the tourists for the most part. I was scared to step out of the line or else he'd scream as if I were an elementary",
          "Enjoyed the tour around but not so keen on all the bones in the catacombs Very easy to loose your way around this area",
          "we thought this would take half an hour, but even though they move fast it takes an hour, an astounding place, well worth a visit, Time seems to have stood still here in some way.",
          "While I was not bowled over with the attractions of Lima overall, the Convent of St Francis really stands out - if you see nothing else in Peru's capital, then see this. There is a wealth of history and many different and interesting parts to the monastery, and the guided tour",
          "This Monastery of Franciscans friars who were amongst the first one to go to Peru and evangelize the population is huge. It is great need of reconstruction and repair. It was sad to see the murals and additional paintings not having been preserved. Upsetting was seeing the",
          "This is definitely worth seeing, even though you have to take an official tour and no photography is allowed inside. It's only S10 to visit and guides will take groups in either English or Spanish. You have to wait until a sufficiently big enough group has gathered before the",
          "Built in the 1600's this is a must see. The cathedral is beautiful and well maintained. The visit to the catacombs was very interesting and our guide was very knowledgeable. She escorted us through the old monestary and gave interesting facts about the monks and their ways.",
          "The church and monastery were completed in 1774. The convent's library is world-renowned. Our Peruvian guide pointed out that the last supper painted by Diego de la Puente depicts typical Peruvian ingredients and meals, instead of European dishes it depicts, such as guinea",
          "Beautiful detail and preservation of the building. Has one of the oldest if not the oldest libraries in latin america dating to the 16th century. Alot of stairs if you have trouble walking It might not be the place for you. I was profoundly amazed at the amount of bones in the",
          "Apart from the macabre fascination of the catacombs, this is a beautiful building with an interesting history, which the guided tour helps make the most of.",
          "Took the English speaking tour last week and had many stairs to climb. Rather hard if you have knee issues like I do. I was walking with a cane and had trouble keeping up with the group. Interesting tour of about 40-45 minutes. Takes you underground to the catacombs. Just",
          "It takes about 45 minutes to tour. Very interesting and affordable place to visit. Just arrive and you will be able to tour having a Spanish or English guide within 15-30 minutes I'd say. We enjoyed seeing the catacombs but be mindful not to go if you are likely to feel",
          "Couldn't get into the church, as it was closed for works to be done, but we went to the catacombs underneath and saw all the bones laid out in sections. Bit creepy.",
          "Beautiful alters, art work, and carved wood cielings. Amazing catacombs with thousands of bones and skulls underneath the church.",
          "Really one church and cathedral is better than the other. Lima have hundreds of them, really one is mot beatiful than the other. This is with excelent restauration. GOOD.",
          "This is a very old church from 1600's and it has catacombs. It was the first public cemetery in the city. There is a guide tour that shows you everything",
          "Great story of St. Francis of Asisi and the Franciscan order. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and there's so much to see here, including the catacombs, and the many beautiful paintings. From Miraflores, it took about 20 min by taxi, depending on traffic and 20-30 soles",
          "Must see if you are in Lima. So ornate and beautiful. By tickets if you would like to see the catacombs as well as they are worth seeing. Most historical Lima tours stop at this site.",
          "This was a great highight on my trip, i love the building to the bits, there are daily tours taking you inside the church, and explaining the art works and the historical facts. The tour also takes us to a massive cemetery built under the church. It was a bit creepy but i really",
          "The exterior of the building is very nice and original and also the cloister, with nice azulejos (Spanish ceramic tiles). The catacombs were very interesting, particularly how they were built to avoid earthquakes. You can check in advance the schedule of guided tours in",
          "An unusual tour through and under the Cathedral. The library was very interesting with its many large books. The walk through the catacombs where 25,000 people were buried is a different experience.",
          "A truly impressive place with all the munks bones arranged in various patterns. The church has lots of paintings by colonial artists",
          "You can take photos inside the church itself ,but not in the museum part or crypt . It is a little boring photos aren't allowed but rules should be followed . Also the guided groups tend to be a little to big ,if there is 30 + persons it can be hard to hear the guide . It would",
          "The Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco is really cool. Monks have lived there for hundreds of years. There is beautiful artwork & woodwork. The church above the catacombs is beautiful with a Moorish influence. The catacombs beneath the church are amazing. You walk through",
          "For me this is the highlight of Lima if you exclude the Huacas (I am biased because my love for Archeology) it is such an interesting visit from the Church, to the monastery with its cloisters and specially the catacombs with 25000 people buried under it. Creepy but extremely",
          "Yesterday I went to visit the Convent with 10 friends from the U.S. I am not a guide! So, we got in an paid for the admission and I asked if there was a guided visit and the lady in charge of the ticket office said YES. We waited around 15min to get inside and the guide started",
          "The church is fascinating and beautiful, with art work and artifacts from the various religious groups and people who have built Lima. The culmination was the catacombs under the church, which was until the 20th century the burial place for rich and poor alike.",
          "This was well worth the trip - about 30 min from Miraflores. Our tour guide spoke too fast and low for us to hear all of it, but what we did hear, it was super interesting!",
          "The church is beautiful. The catacombs are a bit morbid. Note that pictures are not allowed. Worth a visit if you have a couple of hours while in the city of Lima.",
          "This is a very large and impressive cathedral. Attractive inside, typically ornate with lots of alters and an impressive central area all beautifully carved in wood. Head down into the catacombs and that's where it is really interesting - a little claustrophobic and lots of",
          "Beautiful to walk around the old town. Reminds you of Europe and London in terms of the feel and setting. Spend a couple of hours looking at the old school architecture.",
          "Went here as part of our city tour - wouldn't have gone on our own and wouldn't go out of our way to go again. The catacombs with human bones was kind of off putting, to say the least.",
          "Beautiful Church very interesting Spanish Baroque architecture, the altars very unique where saints have local costumes.",
          "Very close to Plaza Mayor this might be one direction when continuing your stroll . It's impressive inside out and full most of the time afterall we are visiting a Catholic country",
          "This was a beautiful monestary in the centre of town. We really enjoyed the serenity here and especially the interesting trip to the catacombs.",
          "Yes. Lots of churches to see. But not a hohum church. A lovely location and we had a private tour guide who was able to give us some great background information.",
          "We came at 9:30 am so we could get in to see the catacomb. It is guided by multi-language guides. English speaking is very small, just the 4 of us, so it was super nice. We got to see many parts of the church not available if you just visit the church for free. The catacomb",
          "Took a Lima City group tour with Lima Vision culminating in a tour of this cathedral. Beautiful architecture and artwork. Highlights were the library and the catacombs. If in the Centro Historico, this is a must visit. Admission was included in the tour price, so I'm unaware of",
          "If you go to Lima, you must go there. Unless you suffer from claustrophobia, a walk in the \"catacumbas\" will be a very strong experience you should not miss.",
          "The cathedral was closed to visitors. The catacombs were mostly empty uninteresting vaults beneath the church. Not nearly as interesting as those in Rome. Save the entry fee and visit the San Pedro Church instead.",
          "Just another big church. If you want to appreciate the architecture and history go for it. Otherwise uhmmmm I don't know, I liked Miraflores better.",
          "The scale and scope of this convent must be seen to help understand the impact that Europeans had on this country. The wealth it must have taken to build and outfit this place was likely gained from exploitation of the native people and their land. Regardless of the politics I",
          "Make sure you visit the crypt of this lovely church. Really interesting building with lots of paintings and lovely cloister.",
          "As very spectacular building and one amongst many other churches in Lima that is well worth taking the time to visit",
          "Ancient church built as a convent. The most interesting thing to me is the library which was eons old filled floor to ceiling with books hundreds of years old. The catacombs are impressive as well",
          "We toured this church with a private guide and thoroughly enjoyed everything. The church is wonderful, the libraries are unique and the book collection is extensive. For me, the catacombs were the highlight. The history of the catacombs is fascinating. I highly recommend a",
          "The convent is beautiful and definitely one of the best places to visit in Lima but even more amazing are the catacombs with thousands of skulls and bones laid out in fancy shapes at the direction of the monks...",
          "The church itself is very beautiful and artistic, but the bit I loved the most was the catacombs, I recommend this highly! Not for the faint of heart though!",
          "A good underground guided tour in English. You will get a brief history of the Catholic burial under the convent. There are still thousands of bones visible. Cost is 10 sol.",
          "The crypt is amazing. So NO PHOTOS are allowed (which kills me) I wish they would sell photo tickets as we were told they are desperate for money to keep up with repairs and renovation. Gorgeous art and frescoes. The tile work is stunning. This is a don't miss site.",
          "Interesting example of Peruvian architecture, but currently under repair, extremely crowded with many street vendors. However, it is a nice stop if you are passing through and exploring the area.",
          "We were lucky the day we went, only 6 people in our group, the tour guide took her time and explained everything pretty well.",
          "When I was planning my trip to Peru and read about this place I was really in doubt about it. Anyway I decided to go. This place is really amazing and different from the everything you can find around the globe.",
          "This was a great place to go to though the catacombs with decoratively arranged bones made me feel a little queasy. It's a very beautiful peaceful place the guide was superb. I loved the library so ancient with a gallery and library steps reminded me of Harry potter",
          "This is a very good sight to spend an hour or two. We had a guide from Haku which made the stay very interesting and much better with a guide. Be sure to see the catacombs and the Last Supper painting. Note the Devil and the self portrait from the artist.",
          "Feel like Indiana Jones discovering the well-kept secrets of this ancient monument. Recomendable for people of all ages.",
          "It has been many years since I have visited this spot but I still look at the photos I got almost monthly. Skulls and bones and cross skulls and coffins pack the ancient catacombs. Definitely the most interesting cheaper attractions in a city of many faces.",
          "This was SO interesting! I did not expect the tour guide to speak English, but she did. And she explained the paintings and other artwork in the basilica, as well as the catacombs - which were very cool. The only downside was that pictures weren't allowed, even without a flash.",
          "I'm not one that enjoys too many historical visits but it was a very informative and very cool experience. The architecture was amazing!",
          "We didn't visit the museum & catacombs (old bones don't do it for me and Rome has more extensive catacombs anyway). The church itself isn't anything special - maybe I have visited too many churches! There are better churches with less fanfare in Lima. If you are short of time",
          "Just to see the 11 paintings, of 3 meters tall each, by Pieter Paul Rubens is worth the visit. We did not visit the Church itself, but the Museum is really good, including the catacombs. Must see",
          "Beautiful church with a lot of things to see. Wooden ceilings and frescas, magnificent wall paintings and murals, gardens. Great catacombs. And one of the most spectacular libraries in the world with outstanding incunables. And controversial Last supper painting with",
          "We visited the church and monastery whilst exploring the historic centre of Lima. I would recommend taking the guided tour, which was very informative and allows you to see the entirety of the complex. The library, which houses over 20,000 books (which date back to the 1500s)",
          "Be sure to go inside. It is very spectacular. You can visit even when there is a ceremony taking place. The choir chairs are all hand carved and beautiful to see.",

        "wiki": "The Museo Larco (English: Larco Museum) is a privately owned museum of pre-Columbian art, located in the Pueblo Libre District of Lima, Peru. The museum is housed in an 18th-century vice-royal building. It showcases chronological galleries that provide a thorough overview of 5,000 years of Peruvian pre-Columbian history. It is well known for its gallery of pre-Columbian erotic pottery.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1925, Rafael Larco Herrera acquired a collection of vases and other archaeological pieces from his brother-in-law, Alfredo Hoyle. There were approximately 600 ceramic pieces in all. The arrival of these objects ignited a collector's enthusiasm in his son, Rafael Larco Hoyle. Soon after, Larco Herrera left his son in charge of the collection and those pieces completed the first collection of what would become the Rafael Larco Herrera Museum.\nDuring that same year, Larco Hoyle received some advice from his uncle, Victor Larco Herrera, a founder of the first museum in Lima. He urged Larco Hoyle to form a new museum in Lima, one that could guard all the archaeological relics that were continually being extracted by clandestine excavators.\nLarco Hoyle agreed with his uncle and proceeded to create a museum that would carry on his father's legacy. Larco Hoyle purchased two large collections: 8,000 pieces from Roa and 6,000 pieces from Carranza. He also purchased several small collections in Chicama Valley, Trujillo, Vir\u00fa, and Chimbote. Within a year, the collection had grown significantly and display cases were installed in a small house on the Chicl\u00edn estate. On July 28, 1926, Independence Day, the museum opened to the public as Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Rafael Larco Herrera.\nThe Larco Museum now lends some of its collection to its daughter museum, the Museo de Arte Precolombino (Pre-Columbian Art Museum), located in Cusco, Peru.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n=== Permanent exhibits ===\n\nThe Museum has several permanent exhibitions. The Gold and Silver Gallery showcases the largest collection of jewelry used by many notable rulers of pre-Columbian Peru. It comprises a collection of crowns, earrings, nose ornaments, garments, masks and vases, finely wrought in gold and decorated with semi-precious stones. Ancient Peruvian cultures represented their daily lives in ceramics, and this gallery holds the world's largest collection of erotic ceramics.\nThe Cultures Gallery exhibits 10,000 years of Peruvian pre-Columbian history. This chronology-based gallery provides visitors with a comprehensive view of cultures that existed in pre-Columbian Peru through the extant indigenous art that has survived since the 16th century Spanish conquest. This hall is divided into four areas: North Coast, Center, South and cultures from the highlands. Showcases have been ordered according to cultural sequence:\n\nFrom the North Coast:  Cupisnique, Vicus, Mochica and Chimu;\nFrom the Central Coast:  Lima and Chancay;\nFrom the South Coast: Paracas, Nazca and Chincha;\nFrom the Highlands: Chav\u00edn, Tiahuanaco, Huari and Inca.Other galleries include the Lithic, Vault, Ceramics, Metals, Textiles and Storage in which visitors have the opportunity to view the Museum's entire collection of classified archaeological objects.\n\n\n=== International exhibits ===\nIn addition to its permanent exhibits, the Larco Museum lends its collections to several museums and cultural centers around the world.\n\n\n=== Gallery of pre-Columbian Erotic Pottery ===\n\nThis hall displays the selection of archaeological objects found by Rafael Larco Hoyle in the 1960s, as a result of his research on sexual representations in Peruvian pre-Columbian art, published in his book, \"Checan\" (1966).\n\n\n== Other points of interest ==\nThe Museum Gallery Shop has a wide variety of ceramic, metal and textile reproductions made by skilled craftsmen from all over Peru. The museum has formalized the reproduction techniques for these pre-Columbian artifacts and assesses each piece to ensure quality.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nBerrin, Katherine & Larco Museum.

It is housed in an 18th-century colonial mansion built on the ruins of a 7th-century pyramid. Organized chronologically, its artifacts represent a variety of ancient indigenous cultures, spanning three millennia. The permanent exhibition contains thousands of priceless objects, including gold and jewelry, ceramic statuary and sculptures, metals, textiles, and a display of erotic representations of the ancient world. The large Cultures Hall provides a comprehensive overview of Peruvian art dating from 7000 bc to the Spanish conquest. The hall consists of four sections, representing the four cultural regions of Peru: the north coast, the centre, the south, and the highlands.The Larco is one of the rare museums that permits its visitors access to its storage facility, which houses an additional 45,000 artifacts. Although they lack curatorial annotation, the objects in the storeroom are arranged by theme and chronology. Much of the Larco\u2019s collection is displayed in its electronic catalog. ",

Miraflores is one of the main tourist attractions in Lima.\nFounded as San Miguel de Miraflores, it was established as a district on January 2, 1857. As a result of the Battle of Miraflores fought during the War of the Pacific, Miraflores got the designation of Ciudad Heroica (\"Heroic City\"). The current mayor is Luis Alfonso Molina Arles. The district's postal code is 18.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe district has a total land area of 9.62 km\u00b2. Its administrative center is located 79 meters above sea level.\nBoundaries\n\nNorth: San Isidro and Surquillo\nEast: Surquillo and Santiago de Surco\nSouth: Barranco and Santiago de Surco\nWest: Pacific OceanClimate\nMiraflores has a marine climate, characterized by mild, humid, and comfortable conditions. Temperatures oscillate from 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) to 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in winter, and from 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in summer. Low clouds are frequent, especially during winter, when morning drizzles are not uncommon. Heavy rain is almost unseen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe only pre-Inca ruin remaining in Miraflores, Huaca Pucllana (formerly Hispanicized as Juliana) can still be seen.\nThe Spanish town of Miraflores was established in the 16th century.  However it was merged into the Lima Metropolitan Area as the city expanded during the early 20th century.  During the War of the Pacific (1879\u20131885), the district was the scene of the Battle of Miraflores. Two thousand people died as a result and the district was sacked and burned by Chilean invaders.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to a 2010 estimate by the INEI, the district has 85,065 inhabitants and a population density of 8,516.84 persons per km\u00b2. In 2010, there were 28,116 households in the district. Miraflores has a high Human Development Index at 0,986 and the lowest poor population in Lima, with only 1.80% of the district living in poverty. Along with its northern neighbour, San Isidro, Miraflores is inhabited primarily by upper-class residents and is consistently listed as one of the three most expensive districts in the country.\n\n\n== Culture and education ==\n\nThe district is also a cultural center, with theaters, cinemas and art galleries. It also has a pre-Inca mud-brick temple called the Huaca Pucllana, one of a number of archaeological sites found in Lima.\nPrivate schools predominate in Miraflores, with the district housing 128 such institutions as of 2010. Conversely, the district is home to only 12 public schools; this can be attributed to the socioeconomic makeup of the district. Schools are divided into primary (grades 1-6) and secondary school (grades 1-5 or 7-11). Since in Peru school only takes 11 years, the typical university education is 5 years long (for undergraduates).\nIn terms of education, the Miraflores district lodges some of the most prestigious private schools in Peru, such as the British schools Markham College, and San Silvestre School, the German school Deutsche Schule Alexander von Humboldt, and the Swiss school Colegio Pestalozzi. It also lodges the University of Piura and the Ra\u00fal Porras Barrenechea Institute of the National University of San Marcos.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism dominates the economy of the district. LAN Per\u00fa has its headquarters in Miraflores. The former airline Aeroper\u00fa also had its headquarters in Miraflores.\n\n\n== Entertainment ==\n\nThe district is full of hotels, caf\u00e9s, pubs, restaurants and shops, which draw large crowds of the local population on Sundays. Parque Kennedy, Miraflores' central plaza, regularly has flea markets and art exhibitions. Larcomar, a shopping mall overlooking the Pacific coast, is located in Miraflores, and is very popular among tourists, young people, and the middle and upper classes. There are restaurants, stores, a food court, ice cream shops, arcades, bowling alleys, nightclubs, bars, and the most modern cinema in Lima.\nThe main tourist attractions include an archaeological complex called La Huaca Pucllana, Parque Kennedy, the Iglesia Virgen Milagrosa (church of the Miraculous Virgin), Parque del Amor (Lover's Park), the Larcomar mall, and Calle de las Pizzas (Pizza Street). \nThe Calle de las Pizzas, located in downtown Miraflores, is a favourite among the youth, foreigners and locals alike. It is home to many pubs, and as its name implies, offers not only drinks but also varieties of pizzas and other food.\nMiraflores has always been a major hub for tourists in Lima. There are a number of hotels in the area, including a couple of international hotel brands. Furthermore, there are several shops selling souvenirs and tourist products. The Miraflores Park Hotel is one of the district's five-star hotels.\n\n\n== Costa Verde ==\nThe Costa Verde (\"green coast\") area has several beaches, which draw surfers and beachgoers during the summertime. However, these rocky beaches are not as popular with bathers as the large, sandy beaches in the districts south of Lima, such as Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar, Punta Hermosa, San Bartolo, Lur\u00edn and Punta Negra. La Marina Lighthouse is located on the cliffs overlooking the Costa Verde.\nParagliders launch from the coastal cliffs, providing there is enough wind.\n\n\n== Skyline ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Pensacola, FL, since 1964, through the efforts of Captain Harold Grow.\n Las Condes, CL\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of upscale shopping districts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Miraflores travel guide from Wikivoyage\n(in Spanish) Municipalidad de Miraflores - Miraflores District Council official website\n(in Spanish) Museo de Sitio Huaca Pucllana (Pucllana Museum Site)\n(in Spanish) Huaca Pucllana Photo Gallery - Huaca Pucllana in Miraflores Photo Gallery\nMiraflores A Magnificent City - Pictures\n5.03 Gigapixel Photo of Miraflores - 5.03 Gigapixel Photo of Miraflores\nStreet View of Miraflores Larco Mar",

          "\"Miraflores Boardwalk\", as a matter of fact, is a sidewalk along the coastal area of the Miraflores District in Lima. At its beginning, it is locally known as \"Malec\u00f3n de la Marina\", then as \"Malec\u00f3n Cisneros\" and, finally, as \"Malec\u00f3n de la Reserva\", already by \"Puente Villena\"",
          "Great to come here in the evening with your partner or family , enjoy the stroll, and the views of the Pacific Ocean. Various restaurants await you to enjoy the marvellous and fresh seafood here in Lima. Many surfers enjoy their time right below .",
          "Walked along and enjoyed the views. Flowers were out as were people. We walked on a Sunday so.saw many families out. We enjoyed the flowers and sculptures along the way. Stopped for a great lunch with a good view of coast.",
          "Is always a great pleasure to walk on this area and be surrendered by the sea and the beautiful views of the Miraflores \u00e1rea.",
          "This was our final stop on our cruise excursion. Great views of the ocean. A gathering place for locals as well as tourists.",
          "We found the Malecon and it was a Sunday and there were many families out and about. There is a strong family bond with the people of Peru and everyone was enjoying the day. I did expect to find more restaurants or bars but at least the section we saw only had one or two. Great",
          "Do love a great long walk along the sea front promenade. This really does give you the chance with amazing back drop. Really stunning and relaxing",
          "Miraflores is a quiet place in Lima. Very safe and with a great view. Shoping centers, good hotels and restaurants nearby. I now know where to go when I am back.",
          "Great place to chill and people watch. Big draw for locals during the weekends. There's food vendors and kiosks. Stunning views of the Pacific. Stay for the sunset on the Pacific horizon....simply awesome! Highly recommended!",
          "It was nice walking around and seeing the nice sights. We also enjoyed a couple of drinks and snacks. The street vendors are polite and offer an array of crafts of good quality just like anywhere else, buyer beware on some of the merchandise. You can also make it down to the",
          "Summer is the perfect time of the year to walk around Miraflores and visit the boardwalk. It is very beautiful, it has great views and a lot of things to see and do (like paragliding, restaurants, etc) Would definitely recommend it if you have a short period of time in Lima.",
          "great place to go for a seaside run, watch paragliders, enjoy the ocean breeze and people watch while walking along the coast super lose to a huge city. Nice way to get a nature fix and stretch your legs afer a mel",
          "Not really the bridge, but the area around it it\u2019s amazing. It has great views and interesting parks with people doing sports here and there.",
          "Love the malecon area in Mireflores. It is so beautiful with the parks overlooking the ocean. There is also a ton to see and do here. I recommend renting a bike and riding along the malecon up and down Mireflores. You can also cross over to Borranco.",
          "I\u2019ve been running on this boardwalk every day for the past week and it\u2019s so refreshing. Given how hot this city can get, it\u2019s amazing to have the opportunity to breathe some fresh ocean air while enjoying the stream of surfers, runners and other groups exercising on the beach.",
          "My family enjoyed strolling from one ocean side park after another seeing gliders, surfers and local families enjoying the parks.",
          "The Miraflores Boardwalk was right outside our hotel CasaBella Miraflores. We walked the from the Lighthouse to the Larcomar Shopping Center and then kept walking to the Bridge of Sighs in Barranco. If you like walking this is good one.",
          "Had 10 days in Peru, this part of Miraflores was exceptional. Our hotel was pretty close by, we got some amazing views of the beach.",
          "Great spot to try and break some of the segments on Strava. There\u2019s loads along the boardwalk, although some have clearly been set by people that aren\u2019t running.",
          "Walkable, scenic, beautiful and accessible. Great artwork, fun to watch the hang gliders. Hang gliders offer rides over and off the cliffs. Perhaps another day. Terrific ocean views, wonderful people watching, and a place to while away the day.",
          "The boardwalk is really nice and a lovely place to walk. If you want to get down to the ocean you have a harder time, either walk down the walkway or walk along the path. Going back up to Larcomar is quite the adventure even for people in good physical shape!",
          "We started around Larcomar which was a very neat outdoor mall with pretty views of the ocean, and then went to the right to walk up the coast and stopped at Parque del Amor and sat a while. It was beautiful views along the way and I highly recommend it!",
          "The boardwalk was a short walk from out hotel.The views along the Pacific were stunning. There are numerous parks, including the famous Love Park, and the Larcomar mall along the way. We were fortunate enough to witness a gorgeous sunset over the ocean. Definitely worth the",
          "Excellent and beautiful place. The views are fantastic and even during the night making a walk it is a good idea.",
          "Not really a boardwalk but it's a great, fairly long walk along the rim overlooking the Pacific Ocean. By one part is the parque de amor, another links with Larcomar, then there is also a bridge. Just a nice walk with flowers, grass and trees dotting it.",
          "Meh. The name is misleading. There is no boardwalk. It is a concrete walkway that hugs the road, and you are quite a few meters above the beach. It would have been better if it were little more away from the main road that is next to it.",
          "I didn't realize it was the Pacific Ocean. Also didn't realize how much of the cliff it was or how pretty it would be. It was great to dip my toes in the south Pacific",
          "A great place to stroll around and enjoying the sights and the views! The coast line views are wonderful. Make sure you use sunscreen!",
          "There is some confusion here - likely caused by a translation error. The Miraflores PIER (\"malec\u00f3n\") is not a significant attraction. And, it is not what most think of as a \"Boardwalk\". The pathway at the TOP of the cliffs is possibly the most emblematic attraction in Miraflores",
          "The Boardwalk is a beautiful seaside walk that will take you form park to park and food stand to food stand with a paragliding port and a mall thrown in. Doing this walk will cover you for Lima.",
          "The Boardwalk is/was busy with plenty going on. The view is impressive as the walk is at least a hundred meters above sea level.",
          "The best place for an early morning walk with great views. very clean and safe, one of my favorite places to spend time.",
          "Go past LarcoMar up the coast towards Lima and you will find a pathway that winds down to the sea. Be ready for a little workout, definitely worth it to see the surfers set up and surf, go out and have a drink on the pier.",
          "Don't miss this great experience. Take the time to walk and observe this great park. Bicycle rentals are available",
          "Beautiful safe area to walk and take in the ocean views. Wear comfortable walking shoes and take a bottle of water.",
          "En espa\u00f1ol: Cada vez que pasa por este lugar me vuelvo muy pensativo al sentir el olor de la marea y un bello atardecer que me cautiva. Recomiendo mucho este lugar para andar solo o con amigos. In English: Every time I pass through this place I become very thoughtful to feel the",
          "A must do in Lima. Especially on a nice day. We very much enjoyed this walk to the love park. Great photo ops along the way!",
          "We walked all along this stretch of town, with views along the Pacific Ocean in Miraflores. The sidewalk path meanders quite a distance, going from park to park, each park is a little different. Nice way to spend a few hours. Along the way, you will be able to buy snacks or",
          "One of the more interesting things I found to do in Lima. The fish market is worth seeing. I felt safe walking along the beach. Not many people were out. Cool to see the surfers",
          "For the globe-runners, Lima is the place to go. The tradition of running from Puerto Inka to Macchu Picchu at the times of the Inka is in the ADN of the Andean runners. In Lima you can run early morning in small groups like Peru Runners. It is a unique experience, when the city",
          "A thirty minute walk from Kennedy Park down a few hundred steps , a walkway over a busy six lane highway and you will reach the Boardwalk. Home to surfers and fishermen and a pier. The water is cold - the pier has a couple of eateries and a number of top end shops - go see and",
          "If you\u2019re visiting Lima you must see the Pacific Ocean and this is a great spot to do it. Avoid the shops beneath the boardwalk.",
          "Miraflores is the place to stay while visiting Lima. It\u2019s clean, safe, has the best restaurants, shops and shopping. The view from Malecon is wonderful. It\u2019s almost the place to JUST see at Peru.",
          "Late afternoon, cool & windy. Not a lovely boardwalk as in New Jersey for example, but the vista over the coastline & ocean is lovely. We walked from el Parque del amour to Larcomar mall. Quite cool & windy.",
          "We walked all the way from Barranco to Miraflores. It's a nice walk. But mind you you are not walking anywhere near the beach. The boardwalk is way above. You see the ocean just like you see in the picture attached. That's it.",
          "We took this walk twice, each way. One time it was a little cloudy but some of the clouds were spectacular. We were above them. The other time it was very clear and well worth the walk.",
          "Walkable and gorgeous night and day. See Lover's Point, as well as many sculptures along the way. Plus far away sights of the lit cross and Cristo. Lights hit the wave actions and were simply so beautiful",
          "Just a lovely walk in the morning or the evening... the view is spectacular!!! You see for los walking their dog, jogging, running. Nothing beats the sea and mountains..lost of surfers out in the early morning.",
          "Safe walk on boardwalk towards mall area. Overlooks the cliffs and water. Can see lots of surfers down below and a number paragliders overhead but if you are not staying near the area or coming for a meal or shopping it\u2019s not really worth the trip in my opinion.",
          "There are bike and walking trails with great view of the sea. It is not easy to get to the beach but from Miraflores I don\u2019t know how to get down to the water. Our friends said the water is cold and not very clean so we stayed away from the beach and just watched the surfers. It",
          "A nice place to walk to get away from the cars and chaos of miraflores. It's nice to be able to walk and not worry about getting run over by a car! The view is spectacular from the boardwalk.",
          "I stopped and I looked around in one of my favorite district in Lima . You can find nice view to the ocean from Miraflores.",
          "Miraflores is located directly on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Big cliffs seem to fall into it, creating a nice contrast between a modern part of the city with high buildings and the flat infinite surface of the ocean. I would definitely recommend to pay this place a visit",
          "We had a free afternoon while staying at the JW Marriott and decided to go for a walk. Spent about three hours walking up and back. Grab some lunch and did some shopping. It was safe and relaxing and enjoyable.",
          "One of the suburb of Lima which offer have a great view of the Pacific Ocean. This boardwalk is one of the main attraction in this area.",
          "The Boardwalk is a great way to spend the day. Depending upon your stamina you could walk the majority of the day if you wanted to plenty of gorgeous view points. There are some shopping and food options along the way. Also a easy walkway to the shore directly under the span",
          "Ita a 2 hour nice walk from Miraflores all the way through the seashore up to Barranco. i always enjoy it, lots of green, lots of sporties, nice.",
          "This is one of the images you see a lot of. Forget what you think and do this - the views are amazing and it's central to the vibe of Lima.",
          "Walking, running, cycling, paragliding, scootering, roller skating...everything is possible and about all just by the Ocean, isn't wonderful?",
          "We went here after 4pm and walked for hours. Stated at one end of the broadwalk and walked around for a few hours until we reached the shopping centre. The views are stunning from up here and the park is full of people enjoying a few hours out.",
          "A short walk there to take some pictures and after that go do some shopping in the mall, that's so relaxing...you can ske some drinks at Mangos Cafe",
          "Enjoy a leisurely stroll along this boardwalk! The views of the coast are fantastic and there are several nice parks along the way, along with shops and cafes.",
          "Nice walking along the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Lots of walkers and people riding bikes.",
          "This is the area that has all the premium luxuries. This is where you will find the top hotels and restaurant. The area has a lot of foreigners and many locals. The views area amazing.",
          "Before dinner, we walked along here watching people in the park, looking at the surfers below us, and admiring the rather scruffy flora. It was very pleasant!",
          "Miraflores has one of the nicest broadwalk with an outstanding view of the pacific ocean. The sculptures was also interesting. If you want to have some simple snacks, the cafe near the park serve very nice crepes and sandwiches.",
          "This area of Miraflores is fun. The view over the Pacific is enthralling and the boardwalk itself has many interesting tiles and sculptures . Well worth a visit.",
          "They certainly named this district right! Miraflores (literally \"look at flowers\") is a great place to visit and an even better place to stay. We stayed at a bed and breakfast for a week and loved it! The boardwalk extends from one end of Miraflores to the other along the ocean.",
          "We loved the boardwalk. It is set up on top of the cliffs overlooking the ocean - there are some great spots to watch the surfers and the paragliders. It is a very safe area, with lots of good places to eat, parks and even a statue of Paddington Bear. If in Lima you must come",
          "The views are simply awesome loved Miraflores and all it has to offer. The high outlooks are stunning!",
          "Most reviews of this seem to be either saying \"it's a bridge, so what?\" or \"we had a bad experience of something completely unrelated to the boardwalk\". I'm sure that fact that the main picture on TripAdvisor is of the bridge is really not helping at all, but the bridge is not",
          "My wife and I enjoyed the Miraflores boardwalk and surrounding area. There are a lot of dining options available and some nice scenery.",
          "Nice views of the Pacific Ocean and the cliffs. Nice for walking or bike riding, can stop at a cafe at the mall.",

          "Plenty of shops & restaurants in a well maintained coastal cliff area. Safe and very photogenic views of the Pacific Ocean. And there is easy access down to the seafront area",
          "For every coastal city, there is the malecon. How can one be different than the other? Many ways. This malecon is pretty long. You can enjoy your leisurely walk at your own speed and watch the paragliders above. Sometimes they look like they are going to crash on the skyscrapers",
          "We stayed close in Miraflores, so we came down to the boardwalk several times, day and night. It is very safe to walk along, at any time, as is all of the Miraflores area. A lovely walk, offering a view out over the coast, as well as an assortment of parks, including the Love",
          "A lovely park - lots of artwork to see. Lots of coastal viewing points. A great place to visit - you can continue to walk along the paths to other parks. Lots of places to sit down to rest or relax.",
          "If the day is sunny and breezy, you will love taking a walk by the cliff overlooking the pacific ocean. Art, exercise circuit and beautiful views. We spent about 4 hrs doing this on our last day in Lima. Loved the relax time outside. You can do hang gliding here if you so",

          "We were staying nearby for one night and came here for a walk. It's very beautiful and well kept. The views are amazing of the Pacific Ocean and the surfers. It's quite relaxing just to stroll and take in the fantastic surroundings. Well worth a visit.",
          "The boardwalk in Miraflores is no more than a beauty view point. There you can see the beach, the ocean, and a southern neighborhood, which is in a hill. If you are host in Miraflores, you can go and spend one of your hours.",

          "We walked around the Park of Love (you'll recognize it from the huge statue of a couple embracing), then walked all the way down the many steps to the seaside area. Fun way to spend an hour or two.",

          "Walking on the Malecon from Miraflores to Barranco was one of the absolute highlight of my visit to Lima. The ocean views are marvellous, the parks along the way well-maintained and full of beautiful flowers. Lots of locals and tourists seem to use the boardwalk for a leisurely",
          "ean. A great place to catch a beautifull sunstet. Lots of stuff to see and do. There is even a mall walking distance",
          "The boardwalk (malecon) is actually a winding path, mainly through parks, that overlook Lima's ocean front. It is a highlight of Lima's wonderful Miraflores District. Allow at least an hour or more for a leisurely stroll from the lighthouse (el faro) to the Miraflores Mall.",

          "Great vistas over the cliffs to the sea. Not a lot of shade so go prepared. Had a hot sunny day and we walked for over 2 hours. I would recommend as a great thing to do in Lima.",
          "We walked several kilometers with an almost constant view of the ocean from the top of the cliff, past the \u201clovers park\u201d and on to the Larcomar mall. Great for people watching.",

          "The entire walk from the Lacomar Mall to the Pardo park is an easy and full of eye-candy. Don't miss the paragliders catch the late afternoon breeze. Have one or two ice-cream bars from the yellow carts driving by, and settle in for a stunning sunset anywhere along the way.",

          "it's a nice walk along the sea side, however from that point of view you'll never touch the sea, because between you and the ocean there are a very high cliff. But that give you a wonderfull position to admire the horizon. Anyway, the beach down the cliff is not very nice in",
          "Great walk by the Pacific. Beautiful park remarkably well kept. With kids stop by the \u201cparque de los ni\u00f1os\u201d (kids park) for a relaxing stop while they enjoy the playground. Great place for a run (I did a 20km session) or bike rental.",

          "Had to use the boardwalk to get to a few places. It wasn't anything special. In fact, it seemed sort of small and crowded. There didn't seem to be enough room, and there weren't even many people. Graffiti and trash. So basically a street in any major city.",
          "This refers to the long walkway in and through the park system in the Miraflores neighborhood. You can see the Pacific just below and this path follows this upper walkway for many miles. There, you can see the Lancomar mall with its cool fountains and shops; further down is",

          "This is an interesting walk just to see how people use the park, to do Tai-Chi, to eat delicious crepes, to watch people walking their dogs and to look over the cliffs to the Pacific Ocean. The cliffs are high so that surfers look miniature. The city of Lima is covering them",

          "A great place to relax and watch the waves. Make sure to bring shoes though, because if you walk on the sand there is a possibility that you could step on a sea urchin. Or, I guess, just look where you're walking. There is an upside to stepping on a sea urchin. It happened to me",

The next-door ice cream shop simply shrugged, and seemed to be tired of answering questions about it. Their website indicates they have set hours, but apparently they don\u2019t bother to",

          "Amazing journey back to the past. Everything was so wonderfully preserved. It felt like a Spanish/ Peruvian Downton Abbey. We saw the owner having lunch with his friends they were lovely and waved. There were violins playing (not sure if actually there or a cd) but set a lovely",
          "You have to visit the house with a private tour guide. It might be a bit expensive but the house is worth the visit. It's a hidden gem in the historical district of Lima.",
          "A house that has been continuously occupied by the same family for centuries is noteworthy just for that alone. The house interesting otherwise as well, with rooms and furniture to match its long history. We even got a glimpse of the owner who walked quickly through the public",
          "An excellent example of the interior home of a count. As we were entering the home, the owner was coming home and we had an opportunity to meet him. A very pleasant individual and it was nice to meet one of the many generations of people who have lived in the home. It was great",
          "This house is one of the first built in Lima by the Spanish. It is chock full of history and quite beautiful. You have to book but it is very worthwhile.",
          "I just went to the door and asked a chap there if i could visit, he asked me to come back in 20 mins and I got a private tour and met the charming gentleman currently in residence. I don't recollect it being expensive as some other reviewers have said, but maybe i was just",
          "A colonial home still occupied by the original Spanish family descended from a conquistador who fought beside Pizarro. Furnishings and art from the 16th century. Delicious Pisco sour and appetizers enhance the unique experience.",
          "I arranged a visit to this house in a similar way to a previous reviewer except that the guide I approached - name and contact information taken from the website of the Casa de Aliaga - actually made the booking with the house for us so I did not need to contact them separately.",
          "This house has been in the same family for centuries and you are likely to meet the current owner when you visit. It is truly a gem with beautiful furniture, lots of history and also offers a moment of respite from the busy city outside - you truly feel transported to an oasis",
          "Between the required guide and the admission, this isn't a cheap visit, and basically, what you see is a pastiche of mostly 19th or 20th century paintings and decorative art (furniture), with a few mediocre colonial paintings (many badly restored). Our guide had no clue about",
          "What a surprise to find this beautiful home behind those big doors! Beautiful woodwork and furniture with fresh flowers in every room. Beautiful.",
          "The same family has lived here since 1524, it is the oldest colonial mansion in the western hemisphere. Courtyards are beautiful, the furniture is original and you will enjoy some tea.",
          "This was the highlight of our city tour. My mom and I love historical home and this one does not disappoint. The furnishings are authentic, there Floors and Spanish tiles are original, as is much of the house. The art work is amazing and the family history is interesting as",
          "Okay, I was skeptical about this tour. First, I had to contact the house, find a list of English speaking tour guides, contact the tour guide, etc... It was also not cheap. 30 sol entrance fee plus fee of the guide. Comes about to be about $50 US. But I'd say it is totally worth",
          "As we made our way along the bustling Jiron de la Union walkstreet, we were not sure where to find Casa de Aliaga or exactly how to arrange a tour of this historic home. We saw a nondescript thick wooden door partially open, with a man standing at the entrance. I approached him",
          "This home was built in 1535 by Pizarro's treasurer. It contains the private residence of the Aliaga family and another 50 rooms decorated with spectacular carved/gilded woodwork. They served a great three-course lunch in a private area for us. Members of the Aliaga family were",
          "What an outstanding tour of this lovely and historic colonial mansion. Generations of the Aliaga family have lived here since the middle of the 16th century and still do to this day. Try to imagine how it must have been to arrive in Lima at that time from Spain and have your",
          "This house has more than 500 years of history and I had the pleasure to visit it on several occasions, both as an individual and with a group where we had dinner and drinks. Having dinner at Casa de Aliaga is like traveling back in time.",
          "If your not on a tour of ding out how to access it is nigh on impossible. I will have to show freinds the photos I took 25 years ago.",
          "We had the opportunity to do a private tour of this house, and it was simply amazing. Beautiful art and private collection. Amazing details in the woodwork and tiles. Mr. Aliaga posed on a photo with us. Definitely a highlight in Lima.",
          "A tour of the Casa de Aliaga was a lovely experience, although the address was hard to find. Once into the beautifully furnished house we enjoyed the rooms, the lovely courtyard, the original tiles and the family history.",
          "I had read about this house in my guide book and we didn't book in advance. The house itself is quite easy to find in the city centre. Through an impressive door, you enter the house. At the top of a beautiful staircase, you will find a statue of Columbus. The house itself is",
          "Our tour in Lima had included the Larco Museum with its extensive and eye-opening collection of Pre-Columbian artifacts. One of our other stops was the Casa Aliaga where we got to see how the well-to-do Spanish conquistadores and their descendants lived. It was an interesting",
          "It is hard to believe that this home is still home to the Aliaga family. Museum quality furnishings and intriguing architecture... It is gorgeous.",
          "We were fortunate enough to be given a tour of this casa which is next to the Presidential Palace in the Plaza de Armes square. The entrance to this three hundred year old house is behind a large pair of wood doors at least 12 feet high. Behind the door a car is parked and only",
          "Since there are not many opportunities in Lima to visit the inside of colonial homes, we decided to give Casa de Aliaga a try. We took the tour offered by the home in Spanish which we had pre-booked; however, there were other travelers who I am sure joined on the spot. So, I",
          "I booked the tour for Aliaga House through our Hostel. You have to book in advance, because this house is still privately owned. It is not far from the Historic Center, and is somewhat difficult to find. I had to ask a nearby security guard. We were welcomed in on time, and came",
          "With wonderful antiques, this centuries old house is a wonderful example of what care and attention can achieve. As part of a small group tour I have no idea of the cost but we were treated to welcome drinks/finger food, a display of ancient Peruviam musical instruments plus a",
          "You must pre-arrange your visit to this easy to miss from the street house that has been in the same family for 16+ generations. The woodwork, the household objects are representative of the colonial period and give visitors a good view into the colonial life / home of the",
          "Right in the middle of the historic district, sitting almost incognito is this beautiful old home. Gorgeous rooms decorated in vintage furniture as it was many years ago. The owner and nobleman was actually at the home talking with people. The home has been occupied by 16",
          "We visited this historic home while in Lima. From the entrance door to the intricate wood carvings to the heavily adorned interior, this was fascinating to see that 2 families still live in this home, but have opened it up for tours and events in order to help off-set the costs",
          "We were charged 20 soles each for a short tour, and our guide didn't speak much English. We asked questions and communicated with our little knowledge of Spanish. The house itself is beautiful and it's amazing that the same family has retained residence for so long. It's",
          "Definitely a hidden gem, right downtown, but not easily identified. The rooms open to the public are worth the time. So well preserved by the current 17th generation!",
          "Very lovely historic home, beautifully maintained for more than 5 centuries. The dining room table was being set for some lucky people about to enjoy a private event. As we were about to leave the current owner drove in thru the elaborately carved wooden doors to the carport.",
          "Before reaching the Casa de Aliaga, we took in the sights of the centre of Lima at night, which was very attractive apart from the traffic. Our visit to the Casa included a private dinner preceded by cocktails and this was a really excellent experience with top class food",
          "This is a private home that is open to the public in order to share the amazing furnishings and art work. The old home is a dream for architects to visit. It is something I would not have chosen to visit, but I am glad that our tour took us here, as it demonstrates so much of",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Lima, not 'made up' it is one of the oldest homes in town, still used by the Marquis of Aliaga descendants, eighteen generations of the same family have lived there making of their home a display of the last four centuries of peruvian history.",

        "wiki": "Rose of Lima (30 April 1586 \u2013 24 August 1617) was a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in Lima, Peru, who became known for both her life of severe asceticism and her care of the needy of the city through her own private efforts. A lay member of the Dominican Order, she was declared a saint by the Catholic Church, being the first person born in the Americas to be canonized as such.As a saint, Rose of Lima has been designated as a co-patroness of the Philippines along with Saint Pudentiana; both saints were moved to second-class patronage in September 1942 by Pope Pius XII, but Rose remains the primary patroness of Peru and of the local people of Latin America. Her image is featured on the highest denomination banknote of Peru.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe was born as Isabel Flores de Oliva in the city of Lima, then in the Viceroyalty of Peru, on 30 April 1586. She was one of the many children of Gaspar Flores, a harquebusier in the Imperial Spanish army, born in Puerto Rico, and his wife, Mar\u00eda de Oliva y Herrera, a criolla native of Lima. Her later nickname \"Rose\" comes from an incident in her infancy: a servant claimed to have seen her face transform into a rose. In 1597 Isabel was confirmed by the Archbishop of Lima, Toribio de Mogrovejo, who was also to be declared a saint. She formally took the name of Rose at that time.As a young girl, in emulation of the noted Dominican tertiary Catherine of Siena, she began to fast three times a week and performed severe penances in secret. When she was admired for her beauty, Rose cut off her hair and burned her face, upset that men were beginning to take notice of her. She rejected all suitors against the objections of her friends and her family. Despite the censure of her parents, she spent many hours contemplating the Blessed Sacrament, which she received daily, an extremely rare practice in that period. She was determined to take a vow of virginity, which was opposed by her parents who wished her to marry. Finally, out of frustration, her father gave her a room to herself in the family home.\n\nAfter daily fasting, she took to permanently abstaining from eating meat. She helped the sick and hungry around her community, bringing them to her room and taking care of them. Rose sold her fine needlework,  and took flowers that she grew to market, to help her family. She made and sold lace and embroidery to care for the poor, and she prayed and did penance in a little grotto that she had built. Otherwise, she became a recluse, leaving her room only for her visits to church.She attracted the attention of the friars of the Dominican Order. She wanted to become a nun, but her father forbade it, so she instead entered the Third Order of St. Dominic while living in her parents' home. In her twentieth year she donned the habit of a tertiary and took a vow of perpetual virginity. She only allowed herself to sleep two hours a night at most, so that she had more hours to devote to prayer. She donned a heavy crown made of silver, with small spikes on the inside, in emulation of the Crown of Thorns worn by Christ.For eleven years she lived this way, with intervals of ecstasy, and eventually died on 24 August 1617, at the young age of 31. It is said that she prophesied the date of her death. Her funeral was held in the cathedral, attended by all the public authorities of Lima. Her feast day is on the 23rd day of August (the 30th day of August in the Traditional calendar).\n\n\n== Veneration ==\n\nRose was beatified by Pope Clement IX on 10 May 1667, and canonized on 12 April 1671, by Pope Clement X, and was the first Catholic in the Americas to be declared a saint. Her shrine, alongside those of her friends Martin de Porres and John Macias, is currently located inside of the convent of Saint Dominic in Lima. The Catholic Church says that many miracles followed her death: there were stories that she had cured a leper, and that, at the time of her death, the city of Lima smelled like roses; roses also started falling from the sky. Many places in the New World are named Santa Rosa after her.\n\nHer liturgical feast was inserted into the General Roman Calendar in 1729 for celebration initially on 30 August, because 24 August, the date of her death, is the feast of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle and 30 August was the closest date not already allocated to a well-known saint. Pope Paul VI's 1969 revision of the calendar made 23 August available, the day on which her feast day is now celebrated throughout the world, including Spain, but excluding Peru and some other Latin American countries, where 30 August is a public holiday in her honor.\nShe is honored together with Martin de Porres and Toribio de Mogrovejo with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 23 August.\nEarly lives of Rosa were written by the Dominican Father Hansen, \"Vita Sanctae Rosae\" (2 vols., Rome, 1664\u20131668), and Vicente Orsini, afterward. Pope Benedict XIII wrote \"Concentus Dominicano, Bononiensis ecclesia, in album Sanctorum Ludovici Bertrandi et Rosae de Sancta Maria, ordinero praedicatorum\" (Venice, 1674).\nThere is a park named for her in downtown Sacramento, California. A plot of land at 7th and K streets was given to the Catholic Church by Peter Burnett, first Governor of the State of California. Father Peter Anderson built one of the first of two churches in the diocese to be consecrated under the patronage of St. Rose.In the Caribbean twin-island state of Trinidad and Tobago, the Santa Rosa Carib Community, located in Arima, is the largest organization of indigenous peoples on the island. The second oldest parish in the Diocese of Port of Spain is also named after this saint. The Santa Rosa Church, which is located in the town of Arima, was established on 20 April 1786, as the Indian Mission of Santa Rosa de Arima, on the foundations of a Capuchin Mission previously established in 1749.On the Caribbean Island of Saint Lucia there are two flower festivals supported by their Societies.  Each society has a patron saint on whose feast day the grande fete is celebrated. For the Roses it is the feast of St. Rose of Lima on 30 August; and for the Marguerites it is that of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, 17 October. Rose's skull, surmounted with a crown of roses, is on public display at the Basilica in Lima, Peru, along with that of St. Martin de Porres. It was customary to keep the torso in the basilica and pass the head around the country.\n\n\n=== Patronage ===\nSaint Rose is the patroness of the Americas, of indigenous people of the Americas, especially of Lima, Peru, of Sittard in the Netherlands, of India, and of the Philippines.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn the last weekend in August, the Fiesta de Santa Rosa is celebrated in Dixon, New Mexico and the Sint Rosa Festival in Sittard, Limburg, Netherlands.\nA barony of Saint Rose of Lima was created in the Royal House of Rwanda on 25 July 2016 by the Catholic king in exile, King Kigeli V of Rwanda.\nMaywood, California, contains the largest parish dedicated to Saint Rose. Dedicated parishes are located in:\n\nSanta Rosa, Colon, Panam\u00e1\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Catholic saints\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJos\u00e9 Flores Araoz, et al.

          "This is not only a normal cathedral, but one with lots of interesting history of the past of Lima/Peru. Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador body is buried here and there is an area dedicated to him in this cathedral. There are also catacombs here and some historical",

          "I'm not Catholic, so I was visiting purely as a tourist. Having visited many large cathedrals throughout Europe, eveything was much as I expected. Being well over 6' tall one of the crypt entrances was a challenge. I also toured the adjacent museum which i actually found more",

          "Not my favorite church perhaps, but it does have some nice chapels and art throughout it. The ceilings are impressive, and it is very large for a place plagued by earthquakes. The main focus is really Pizarro and his tomb. It's worth going to see that, especially if you are",

          "Visited a half dozen churches in Lima, all far nicer, more beautiful, more intimate. Other than being on the main square, this one has nothing going for it. Just a big hall. Save your money and give it to someone in Lima who needs it more.",
          "Facing the Plaza de Armas, the cathedral offers an impressive interior that is emblematic of the Catholic Church and the Spanish colonial empire.",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the center of the wonderful historic part of Lima ! Great architecture , in the style of the most famous european cathedrals , featuring great paintings...",
          "The Cathedral is beautiful outside and inside. The ticket for the inside tour includes the useful map. we enjoyed the tour inside. No needs for the tour guide, especially if you read the history of the site online before the tour.",
          "This is right in the main square of Lima. It\u2019s a big and beautiful cathedral full of pretty niches! Spend a little while exploring this space!",
          "It has a great history behind it. Years ago it used to be free entrance and one can attend mass now everything has become pay to play and the price is not cheap, just to go in and check out the amazing historical sites",
          "The architecture of this church is some how different to other Basilicas. Nice artwork and great history on the first colonist of Peru. You should not miss this visit. The view of square in front of the church and the government palace is very nice.",
          "That was the destination of our Mirabus Tour. The guided visit was adequate. I have seen many more beautiful cathedrals than this one but it was interesting to visit.",
          "The cathedral is a majestic place with an incredible history. We had a guided tour, which helped us understand the importance and background.",
          "While it may not be as stunning as the cathedral in Cuzco, it is well worth a visit when in Lima. Easy enough to get to it -- and fun to walk in the area afterward.",
          "This cathedral is magnificent. The architecture and paintings are well worth the entrance fee. The crypt is also part of the tour.",
          "I've visited a lot of cathedrals and although I haven't visited them all this definitely was grand! Nice way to kill sometime and visit a piece of history while in Lima.",
          "The nave is quite plain and the stained glass windows are nice, but there are about 14 side chapels which are all very different and have all been restored so are a bit ornate for my taste. Pissaro is buried here - the correct body now.",
          "This church has fantastic architecture and great paintings. It also contains the mortal remains of the city's founder, Francisco Pizzaro.",
          "Located near Plaza Mayor and the more impressive Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco one can still appreciate the beauty of Lima's Cathedral free of charge when visiting the area.",
          "The Cathedral of Lima is stunning. Not only the part of the temple, but the religious art museum with magnificent pieces of colonial art. After the Inca Empire in the 1500s, the Spaniards gave the order to establish the Viceroyalty of Peru and this is how Lima has so many",
          "Lima\u2019s main cathedral located on the plaza de armas is imposing and one of the oldest in South America you should take time for a guided tour which provides so much information. The architecture is beautiful. Don\u2019t miss the chapel for Pizarro's tomb. The treasury and other",
          "Lots to see here including the tomb of Francisco Pizarro who still to this day splits opinion in Peru.",
          "Tons of $$ spent on a building, while the local environment is trashed. Don't spend more than 10 minutes there.",
          "This is the prominent building on the main square. In traveling through Europe you can get a bit numb to cathedrals, but this is the one to see in Peru.",
          "We would normally just walk around but we were with a guide who took us into the crypts which we may not have found and also into the little museum which were added interest.",
          "Don\u2019t expect ancient or very old buildings in Lima - most date to the mid-1800s. This cathedral is not spectacular as you will see in Europe, so don\u2019t expect a wow. However, it\u2019s part of Lima\u2019s history so worth a visit.",
          "Interesting tombs to walk into. The church is nice but nothing like European cathedrals. The most interesting/ controversial figure buried there is Pizarro. They don't accept credit cards as a form of payments. 10 soles per person or 30 soles included with tour of the arzobispo",
          "Very good Spanish language tour with a voluntary donation.Very extensive information about this important historical site in Lima, Peru.",
          "We normally are not interested in cathedrals, but this one was quite impressive. Enjoyed seeing the intracate wood designs and tile mosaics were very nice. We were here just before the Pope's arrival, so everything was particularly nice.",
          "This is a great cathedral. There so much to see. Pay to enter Peruvian money about three US dollars. Small art collection left end. Access to the crypts, fairly big. Well worth the price of entry.",
          "The remains of the founding father lie in this Cathedral. Many beggars and street sellers are on the steps of the Cathedral. Local police is vigilant. Go with a guide and learn about the organ that no longer works!",
          "Given the price to go in (30 soles a person) I expected more to see. You get a map with short explanations of all the different shrines in there and there's a underground tomb but that's pretty much it. I expected more history and items to it so I found it to be a bit pricey for",
          "On a tour, I stopped for about 5 minutes waiting for the van to pick up the group. There was an evening service at the time, so I just sat in one of the pews to take in my surroundings. Even though I am not a religious person, I found the Cathedral very serene. The hustle &",
          "It is interesting to notice the Pervuian version of Jesus being painted in black colour unlike the European version. The artwork, sculptures, and carving of the church were pretty and splendid.",
          "It is wortha visit to see the choit impressive chairs and Pizarro's burial site. The cathedral is open as a Museum. Worship only during the weekends. The ticket gives you entrance to the bishop's palace, just beside.",
          "You can't go to Lima and not see this Cathedral. The history and beauty are stunning. Highly recommend.",
          "A nicely preserved Cathedral from the 1600\u2019s fronting onto the Plaza Major and extending for almost a full city bock. Interior decorations, art and artifacts are sensational.",
          "It is impressive baroque building in the heart of Peruvian capital. I would not say that many people visit the cathedral every day but anyhow it is a historical monument. It has been renovated because the towers were damaged during one of the earthquakes.",
          "I was here on a fast tour and was not disappointed. Very beautiful cathedral and especially the tombs under the cathedral was very exciting. I highly recommend to go to this place if you have a chance.",
          "but not too ornate. The style has been toned down somewhat. A couple of interesting chapels, one showing the Virgin Mary in a huge frock.",
          "I loved the lights and the ornate sculpture. This Cathedral is stunning and one feels at peace even if you are not catholic.",
          "I've seen hundreds of Churches and Cathedrals from around the World but this one was unique as we had a personal guide with us who made a good difference with his detailed explanations.",
          "We did a city tour and this was on the list. It is a huge Cathedral that has been added to since first construction and is imposing taking up a whole block.",
          "If you are already in Lima, you should go there. It is not precisely a colonnial venue, but walking around the first plaza is very, very nice.",
          "A Roman Catholic Church within the main plaza that one can't miss with its two high towers and large doors that lead to a good number of chapels once inside.",
          "One can see the time, human effort and intelligence needed to create the art of this cathedral. Unfortunately, many went hungry to make and maintain it.",
          "This stunning 16th century Cathedral is a must see. The interior is just wall to wall with outstanding artifacts. Also the first stone set for this Cathedral was set by Fernando Pizarro. You need to spend some time here to really enjoy everything in this Cathedral.",
          "This was a very satisfying site. The size, the elaborate decor, the number of artifacts on display made it a very worthwhile visit. We were pressed for time so we couldn't visit the other religious buildings around the square (they sell a package of tickets too) so we picked the",
          "We couldn\u2019t take pictures inside because of mass but it was interesting architecture. It is an iconic part of the history of Lima.",
          "It's well worth exploring this vast cathedral. I've never been in a cathedral with so much to see. It can take quite a time to explore all of the cathdral including the crypt. Wonderful wood carvings, paintings and highly decorated alters. Get a combined entrance ticket for the",
          "It's hard to review cathedrals like this. The Cathedral of Lima is a gorgeous structure that needs to be seen to be appreciated.",
          "Worth a visit the cathedral is constructed internally from stucco and not stone. In one area a section of the wall has been opened up that you can see the construction with bamboo and plaster. Also some side chapels with decoration well worth seeing.",
          "Known for being home to the tomb of Spanish conquistador, Francisco Pizarro, the Cathedral of Lima is a beautiful building. The main church of Peru dates back to 1535, but the 1746 Lima earthquake destroyed the church, requiring a rebuilding effort from scratch which was not",
          "The Cathedral is located in the Plaza Mayor and the building has undergone many reconstructions and transformations since its constraction on 16th century but it retains its colonial structure and impresive fa\u00e7ade. There are 14 side chapels and a lot of paintings.",
          "Tpical church built after the Conquista.A lot of gold and statues. Veruy rich decoration . Its particuliary intersting to go for the office Sonday morning",
          "Georgous !! this place so far could be one of the best places to visit in lima ...you definitly have to go there and make and stop there!",
          "We were a little disappointed when we arrived and found out that you have to pay to enter. I've never visited a church where they charge you an entrance fee. That said, if you find yourself in Lima you'll soon realize that there is not a TON to do, and this being a world",
          "I could not believe they charge $30 soles to enter, you don't even have to pay at the Vatican, and you have to pay here. Really amazing, don't pay. Beside seeing the rests of Francicos Pizarro, is just a huge church.",
          "Always enjoy visiting the iconic cathedrals when travelling. For a fee of 30 sol, we gained admission in the cathedral and the museum of religious art of the Lima cathedral. In addition, the ticket included admission in the adjacent Lima Archbishop's palace museum. Delightful!",
          "This is the major attraction of Lima. You can see little free of charge but I highly recommend you to pay 30 soles and you will be able to see whole cathedral and house of archbishop.",
          "This is actually a museum as well. Lots of history. The guide was good. There is a small entry fee. There is a small tourist shop and snack bar as well.",
          "From the outside it looked good, bit different with its central architecture. We didn't get inside, as it was closed, but got to go to the basement where all the bones and skulls are layed out to see. Ok if you like to see that sort of thing.",
          "This place is very interesting. The church altar and the paintings are beautiful but the highlight of the visit are the crypts under the church. More than 25,000 people are buried under the church and they have a big display of bones and skulls under there. A little creepy but",
          "Cathedral of Lima is reflective of the Spanish colonial period in Peru's history. The architecture is reflective of Spanish cathedrals with their Arabic influences. It was also interesting to note that the foundation was built on its predecessor Inca buildings. The Peruvians",
          "It's a must visit place Christian or no Christian the in er beauty and faith makes you come here . Just beautifully done church .lucky to be there",
          "if you've been to europe, you'll know what to expect. after traveling extensively in europe it wasn't anything special.",
          "I have seen many beautiful churches and cathedrals over the years and this is right up there with the very best. But that's not what makes the Cathedral of Lima different. This Cathedral has a basement which shows history of Lima in human form. In Europe it is a common practice",
          "Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! Everything filled us with awe. Jesus on the cross was almost life-like and was very moving. A must see while in Lima!",
          "Nice church, but nothing spectacular, for people who travel a lot in Europe, it will for sure disappoint",
          "The main altar of the Cathedral is being restored. As one enters, one can see the coffin of Pizarro- Spanish conquistador who did much damage to the Incas and Indian population. There are many side altars venerating Christ, Bkessed Mother and saints. Many of these are covered in",
          "This vast cathedral offers a lot of surprises and is probably the highlight of Lima. There is a great deal to explore and see and for the combined ticket with the Archbishop's Palace next door of S30, it's great value. However, as of July 2017, the main altar is under",
          "Although the main altar was under restoration, we saw the catacombs and Saint rose of Lima, also other altars, beautiful wood works",
          "The cathedral of lima, is one of the most beatiful cathedral at latin america. Restauration is great, the history is here. we returned.",
          "This is another spot to visit in the historical center. A great cathedral in the heart of the historic section. Worth stopping in to see if you are in the area.",
          "This Cathedral is one of the jewels of what is left of Colonial Architecture in Lima and it stands proud after resisting aloof so many earthquakes. Nice impressive facade and inside still nice but in a way is quite serene and unassuming Nice visite",
          "Cathedral of Lima is located at the main square of Lima and has a simple but a magnificient ceiling design. There are also many chapels lined up next to each other dedicated to the saints from wooden to golden material. The entry price is cheap and it is not very crowded so you",
          "Beautiful cathedral. Can't take pictures but if no guard is around you can! You can go and visit the place where francisco pizarro. I believe you have to buy a ticket for that. Beautiful altars and balconies. Great view to the govt palace and plaza de armas.",
          "This is large and impressive. Lots of attractive side chapels and an interesting little crypt downstairs. Some areas in need of repair, but it is inexpensive to visit and worth a look.",
          "The paintings, statues, and intinerior are beautiful and it was nice to just sit in a pew and enjoy the beauty of the church. No pictures are allowed inside so one needs to spend some time to go through the chruch.",
          "I walked here from the Sheraton. The was a 10 solas charge for entrance to the church. It included entrance to the museum at the next door bishops museum but that was closed. The side chapels really are beautiful. There are a couple of places where stairs lead down. One to",
          "Located in the heart of Old Town Lima and the Plaza de Armas, the cathedral is definitely worth a stop in. You can purchase tickets just to visit the cathedral, and not the museum. It is not particularly enormous or ornate, but still worth a visit",
          "The facade of the Cathedral of Lima is of Renaissance style with plateresque adornments. Its high towers with spire of slate are neoclassical with stylistic influences of the escurialense school and of the north of Europe. It has 3 doors, as in most cathedrals. The main one",
          "I'm not so fan of cathedrals, however I think this place offers way more than just holy stuffs. It is full of history related with Lima, south american colony and so on...",
          "This cathedral is amazing. There are many altars on the side wall, in many different styles. From baroque to neoclassic you can have a historic line in catholic architecture. There are also catacombs downstaris where you can see how they buried bishops and priests. It is",
          "If you are in central Lima, budget some time to see this structure. It sets next to the Monastery so you can visit it as well. Nice history of a Spanish architecture.",
          "This cathedral has some wonderful pieces of religious art as well as a crypt! It's definitely well worth your time if you like this sort of thing!",
          "The conquistador, Francisco Pizarro, laid the first stone for construction of the Cathedral in 1535 and it was completed in 1538. Over the centuries it has undergone many transformations and restorations, the latest in 1940 as a result of earthquake damage. Parts of the interior",
          "Enjoyed my visit here. It's all very elaborate and heavily guilded . I loved the catacombs and we were the only ones down there. I was mesmerised by this huge well where 75 k dead were chucked then lime was placed on them . Also found the museum of religious artifacts interesting",
          "This one of a kind \"House of God\" is definitely worth a visit. Take a look at it's marbles and discover its hidden historic artefacts.",
          "Amazing Cathedral, with catacombs. If you were upset about not being able to take photos of the bones at the San Fransiscan Convent, here is the place to take a few shots. Pictures allowed, just no flash. Only 30 soles, and it gets you into the Archbishops' home as well (located",
          "Lima Cathedral is amazing. It is huge and ornate with lots of religious art. The tomb of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro is here and that in itself makes the place worth a call. Stunning facade and a nice plaza in front. There is a nice, serene atmosphere about the place and",
          "This Monastery is a must see if in Lima. The 17th century complex with its magnificent tiles, ornate carved ceilings, and exceptional paintings is something to see; however, the most memorable part of the complex is the world-renowned library. The monastery complex includes both",
          "A must if touring the cultural precent of Lima. It doesn't take very long to get a feel of the place. Very impressive.My one negative comment would be the presence of a military personal and flag (at least one, was it two?) standing to attention bringing a military air to",
          "On the Plaza de Armas. Large and ornate. Six chapels on each side, one for each apostle, very ornate altars.",
          "Lots to see in this Cathedral which is very big and grand. There are some great paintings in the church. Lots of history.",
          "I bought a joint ticket with the archbishop's palace and the cathedral, and I felt that the cathedral was the more interesting of the two. Right at the entrance, there is the tomb of Pizarro, which technically can be visited for free. The remainder is largely a visit like any",
          "We visited the cathedral during our visit to the Centro Historico and it was a definite highlight with toms of history and amazing art. We took the offer of a tour guide, and our guide Jesus was exceptional. We highly recommend it.",
          "When in the centre of Lima, it is very worthwhile spending the 10 soles in admission and visiting this church. It is the resting place of the founder of Lima and is adorned with a great many small ornate chapels.",
          "Definitely worth the visit. There is a lot to observe and see and you can take as much time as you want. Many of the shrines are quite intricate.",
          "I would strongly recommend you use a guide. There is much to understand and without background information it is just a nice cathedral. A beautiful place to see, unfortunately when we were there the cathedral was undergoing some upgrades so sections were unaccessable,",
          "This is a beautiful building. Very intricate and quite awesome to see. We visited during a half day Lima tour.",
          "Perhaps I am seeing Lima through the eyes of having visited Cuzco first. I saw the Lima cathedral as trying hard to be Spanish/colonial...and that the whole building was pretty new..due to the earthquake reconstructions. But it is worth seeing.",
          "Wonderful Cathedral in Centro Lima. We really enjoyed this great church. Lot's of very nice art work. Only problem was the main church was under reconstruction. Still worth the visit.",
          "Great place to visit while in Lima. Lots to see and do. Many other local attractions all in walking distance. Best not to visit on Sundays due to closure for mass service",
          "This place is beautifoul, defenitively one you have to go if you are in Lima. The decorations are awesome.",
          "We had a guided tour of the Cathedral by a very knowledgable guide. The Basilica Cathedral of Lima is a Roman Catholic Cathedral located in the Plaza Mayor in downtown Lima. Construction began in 1535. If you visit check out the catacombs underneath the church.",
          "We had a good visit. The guide is well written the the church is well kept and has beautiful artwork. We left with knowledge of the community and the history of the area. It was a good stop.",
          "Closed on Sunday. Recommend you use a guide to explain the details of the construction, and recovery from adverse events (fire, earth quakes). Very interesting history and beautify art",
          "You will see where Pizarro is buried and learn how he died in detail! (gory) You will see frescoes showing historical view of Spain conquering the local indian population and see how Pizarro treated those who did not want to follow him. The alter and choir are beautiful hand",
          "Surprisingly beautiful well maintained side chapels. The stain glassed windows were also very nice. The interior is well maintained.",
          "Worth the ten sols admission. The Cathedral of Lima is amazing; the first stone of the church was laid by Pizarro in 1535. The tile work is exquisite, the ceiling vaulting magnificent and access to the ossuaries and tombs is unfettered. The religious and historical",
          "This place is so beautiful, I really recommend the Cathedral of Lima, my family and I we enjoy the moment.",
          "As could only be expected, the Cathedral in Lima is a beautiful example of a classic Spanish Colonial style building with all the Cusco style paintings to accompany. The only thing my family and I found strange was that in Peru, both Lima and Cusco, you are charged an entrance",
          "Definitely a must see and in some parts a quiet place in this busy city. The museum part in the back is very interesting and most larger groups don't make it back there. The catacombs are interesting but you need to be willing to see skulls and bones.",
          "There are no words to describe the opulence of the Lima Cathedral...the riches of the Spanish Empire manifest. The catacombs were fascinating but not for the claustrophobic or physically challenged. If you're in Lima I highly recommend taking this tour - especially good way to",
          "The altars and religious art is truly awe inspiring. It is also a good place for some quiet reflection.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral! Free entry to roam around or attend confession. We spent about 30 minutes walking around the cathedral.",
          "Taking a short tour of the Cathedral will expose you to the history of the conversion of the indigenous peoples of Peru and its influence on the construction and decorative artistry of the building. You will also learn about the history of several Peruvian saints.",
          "This is an impressive cathedral, a great space. It is easy to be distracted by the individual side chapels, each one is a work of art with carved and gilded altarpieces and statues, each with a different theme. I was rather taken with ST Judas Thaddeus, the patron saint of the",
          "Being Catholic, this Cathedral had special meaning. But, regardless of religious affiliation (or not), it is very enjoyable to tour the inside. Guides available.",
          "The huge colonial Cathedral houses a majestic nave and central altar, fifteen artfully built shrines, including one keeping Pizarro's coffin, and a marvelous museum displaying a rich Arte Sacra collection rated among the most beautiful in the New World. It is easy to spend 2 to",
          "It costs 25 solaces to get into the cathedral. An audio tour is included but the device did not work very well. Still we enjoyed touring around this large cathedral.",
          "The lower level are catacombs and a sea of bones and skulls. Very creepy. The traffic makes it very hard to get to.",
          "Has shades of peruvian culture in design. Excellent for history lovers. Well maintained and classical piece of architecture.",
          "There were many beautiful alcoves in the Cathedral. Each alcove had it's own character in it's design and artwork.",
          "Glad to have taken time off from the sightseeing to spend sometime within. A great peace descends on you when you enter the portal of this cathedral. I felt a certain connect with the Virgin Mary's statue within, not withstanding the fact that I am not a christian.I felt",
          "just across from the Plaza de Armas, a very beautiful cathedral. No fee to enter and using discretion, pictures are allowed. The detail inside is unbelievable with such fine craftsmanship, centuries old.",
          "This is a great church. You must give this at least 20 minutes of your time. It does look like many of the colonial churches in South America but it does have it's unique qualities.",
          "Beautiful cathedral, well worth the visit. It's enormous inside and the architecture is stunning. You won't regret going!",
          "It's across the street from the majestic \"Plaza de Armas\" in downtown Lima. It's free to enter and you can take pictures inside. It's a classic colonial design. Ver nice to visit.",
          "The Cathedral of Lima is in the historic district and is interesting to see. If you want to compare this to the large cathedrals in Europe, you may be disappointed, but there really is much to see. The crypts were interesting. The art work is generally dark. We paid it with",
          "This is a typical Catholic cathedral in most respects. The most interesting aspect is the large painting of the Last Supper where the principle part of the meal is a pretty good sized guinea pig and where Judas is presented as a dark skinned Moor. There is also a large",
          "A beautiful cathedral built just after the Spanish conqured Peru in 1535. Do not compare it versus other cathedrals in Europe - just enjoy it Lima.",
          "Whoever said that LIma is not worth visiting is either a tour groupie or just lacking interest in culture, craftsmanship, and art. This is truly one of the world's great cathedrales, albeit there are lots of great cathedrales. The blend of cultrues in the craftmanship and art",
          "This is the biggest of all cathedrals in Lima and was the highlight of our visit. It has nice sculptures and the museum. There is even underground part to visit which is fascinating.",
          "Big typical catholic cathedral. Being made to pay to enter 'the' house of God's seemed a bit penny pi Ching, I guess the Peruvian Government t spend all their money on themselves still.",
          "If you have been to the great Cathedrals in Europe, you can skip it entirely. Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco near by is more interesting.",
          "Visited this cathedral as part of a tour that included Plaza Mayor and the colonial district. I'm not much of a cathedral person but this place is worth going to. The inside of the cathedral have some very unique designs that are not the norm for catholic churches and also,",
          "Spectacular cathedral, They say if you get married in a cathedral, divorce is not an option ever. Romantic really. I realize that no-one gets married with the expectation to get a divorce but this is real sentiment held dear by all.",
          "The Cathedral is a landmark at Plaza de Armas. Huge, Majestic but, somehow, simple as well. The interior is almost a bit auster if you don't have all those chapels attached. Beautiful building with the main core, The Altar, with a wooden masterpiece...Incredible!!!",
          "The Cathedral of Lima is located right off of the Plaza Mayor in the Centro Historico in Lima (close to downtown). They offer mass services numerous times a week (times change seasonally) but the church is open until 5pm Monday-Saturday for viewing. There are numerous",
          "Considering other cathedrals I have been too, this one is not amazing. Do not spend much time on it, but visit it anyway.",
          "An incredible church with the remains of conquistadores. We were here when the previous pope was announced, you knew it immediately, the bells were ringing, and the priests were out shaking everyones hand",
          "Lots of interesting art and decoration. A big service was going on but we still able to wander round the edge and explore the catacombs.",
          "one of the most beautiful churches I have ever visit. the architectonic aspect was amazing. very nice and cultural place to visit",
          "A very large, beautiful, historic church with so many beautiful statues and historic church relics. Downstairs there are catacombs.",
          "While visiting the Plaza Mayor we visited the Cathedral there. It was very nice, but not spectacular.",
          "This was the third cathedral we visited in Peru and it exceeded my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that photography was allowed (not the case with the others we visited) and that the cathedral contained so many things worthy of photos - amazing art and architecture,",
          "This is an impressive cathedral in the old center, you'll appreciate it even more if you're into Spanish architecture.",
          "The title says it all. If you're any sort of history buff, this is a must stop. The tile mosaics, the view into the crypt, the art, all worth the trip.",
          "I'd been ambling around the city, taking in the sights & sounds. Must say: the cathedral, and indeed the plaza its situated in, took my breath away...",
          "Very beautiful cathedral well worth seeing. There were lots of groups of school children visiting the catacombs but I personally found them quite creepy with all those skeletons piled up in dim light and having to bend over and creep through the tunnels.",
          "An excellent example of colonial Spain religious architecture that is part of history of Lima. It closes early, so arrive prior to four PM to give yourself time to tour. Lacks guided tours.",
          "Having just been on a South American tour, which covered many churches and cathedrals - what stands out from this cathedral is the fine tiered, altar and the very ornate intricately carved wooden choir stalls. At the front of the cathedral there are also murals depicting how",
          "Beautiful cathedral to be visit while in Lima's old town. Very close to other important buildings that can be visited in one morning tour.",
          "Main cathedral in Lima. It is very big but decorated very well too. A lot of artworks are displayed. A small museum is located inside of the cathedral. You can take photo inside of cathedral as well. Don't forget Pizarro's tomb",
          "We obtained a joint ticket with the archbishop's palace next door. Well worth a visit. From the outside it isn't as grand as the European cathedrals, but it is important historically. Significant chapel with mosaics detail for Pizarro, on he right as you enter. The most",
          "If you don t want to queue outside at visiting hours (mornings, except Sunday's) and want like we did to get in in the later afternoon as soon as we arrived, by the back door to the wonderful chapel you may want to check the mass schedule and attend one ? But once in you cannot",
          "Lima cathedral is unique in Latin America, lots of amazing altars, the tomb of Francisco Pizarro and a very nice guided tour worth to be taken",
          "This cathedral is very nice. There are large murals throughout and even catacombs that you can visit.",
          "Another cathedral--yes, and worth it! It is absolutely beautiful! Walk around and study all the wood work. Sit and enjoy the lovely altar. If you are lucky, you will hear parishioners singing.",
          "This is truly awe inspiring both outside and in. When looking across the square and you see the Cathedral you will literally stop and stare and this architectural marvel. Upon entering the first thing you will notice is the massive scale of the cathedral itself, it looks like it",
          "Having seen dozens of chuches and cathedrals, this is not as spectacular as most, but very spiritual in it's relative simplicity",
          "There is more than Pizarro's tomb (which is nicely presented). A few tombs have been discovered in the last few years, which you can visit. Everything is nicely presented and the staff is super friendly, definitely worth the visit!",
          "Beautiful church, easy to visit quickly if you only have limited time. A good tour too (just wish it was a bit longer, more detailed. Maybe they could add some self-navigation tools (like audio). Still worth doing the tour though! Visit the crypts.",
          "The Cathedral is beautiful, filled with wonderful altars and art. The remains of Francisco Pizarro are located here. You are able to walk underground to see some \"catacombs\" too.",
          "It is worth seeing, and it has a lot to see. We purchased the ticked that allows entrance to various areas of the cathedral and were impressed by the quantity and quality of the art work, it is certainly worth spending a couple of hours seeing it.",
          "Before flying out of Lima on our journey to Puno we had enough time to take in a few of Lima's tourist musts. As with any religious country the Church plays a very important part of it's culture. Peru is no different. Following the invasion, conquest and decimation of the Inca",
          "The cathedral is unusual construction as made of wood and mud bricks and covered with cement render. Lots of timber due to the dry atmosphere in Lima and the earthquakes are withstood better with timber structures. Excellent history on display throughout the cathedral and",
          "The Cathedral of Lima is an impressive structure from the outside and inside. There is a free tour, but you are supposed to tip the guide. She was fairly good and I gave her 20 soles to take the three of us around. It is an interesting building with a lot of history and a",
          "Parts of this cathedral have been reconstructed after a major earthquake in the 18th century. From the outside, the building is not particularly beautiful, certainly compared to some European cathedrals. However, on the inside I found most interesting the tomb and mosaics",
          "Typical South American cathedral, but it does contain the remains of Pizarro who is a polarizing figure in Peru today",
          "I thought it was a beautiful building to venture to, especially from the outside. The architecture was interesting and inside it was peaceful. Easy to get to from one of the main squares.",
          "very beautiful buildings, exudes peace and tranquility, I was lucky but it was not crowded when I was",
          "Many people feel that one Cathedral is just like the next, and maybe they're right. I love the opulence of it all, and this is no different. The carving on the seats in the choir stands is really intricate and beautiful. Not the best Cathedral I've seen in Peru, but still really",
          "it is so beautiful you have to see it, very well located and with so many gardens and palmeirs , go visit during the day",
          "Let me start by saying I have visited many famous cathedras, including Chartres, Notre Dame and St. Peters. For some reason the beauty of this cathedral really got to me. It was almost an emotional reaction. We were fortunate to have it almost to ourselves on a weekday around",
          "You must see this beautiful Cathedral in Lima. It is well maintained and there are tour guides if you want. A must see while here.",
          "I think it is now more or less a museum. There is a small fee to enter and it is a Colonial Cathedral with some local influence. Under the Cathedral there are some catacombes which are very intresting for their historical element.",
          "I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews I'm reading. We really enjoyed exploring the cathedral and thought it was well worth the ten soles entrance fee. The beautiful carved choir alone is worth the price of admission but I also enjoyed the artwork (both as part of the",
          "When we arrived at the Cathedral we were told that the entrance was 30 soles (about$10) when we balked we were told that if we did not want to see the catacombs or museum it would be less. Even at the lesser price it was not worth it. After seeing the cathedrals in Cusco you",
          "We went as part of city tour.It is a very interesting tour that includes the crypts.This makes for a different view of the world in the cathedral",
          "This cathedral was uninspiring but it does contain the remains of the Conquistador Francisco Pizarro so history lovers you have to go for that reason. There are holes in the roof which didn't have a narrative, take note tourist board you could beef up the restoration story as",
          "The front porch of the Cathedral is very interesting but the inside is a bit disappointing. The tomb of Pizarro was not accessible when we went there.",
          "I was lucky to be confirmed in this wonderful Church. It is large and in the middle of a plaza overlooking the Presidential Palace. You can also admire the paintings in the style of the Cuzco School. Francisco Pizarro's body is buried here, you can see it at the right",
          "We went to the Cathedral on our last day in Lima. Glad that we wend as the history and site is fascinating. The ornate and the very different style in each section provide visitor with a glimpse of the past. Highly recommended",
          "Loved this Cathedral for it's beauty but also cultural importance. You can see an interesting mix of Spanish influence and Peruvian uniqueness among the art and architecture here. And all that gold! Not sure why we're looking for the lost Incan treasures when they're probably a",
          "I took a quick peek inside and while the church is pretty, I enjoyed the San Pedro Church (Jesuit), the Our Lady of Mercy Church, and the Santo Domingo Convento just as much and you got a much better local vibe.",
          "This is a beutiful cathedral, unfortunately, the current archbishop only allows the entry if you pay an expensive input (for the average Peruvian) or if you go on a Sunday lunchtime to listen to your eternal damnation (Opus Dei Mass). This temple was built to the delight of God",
          "Beautiful must do activity. Located in the centre of old town. Team it up with watching the changing of the guards at the Presidential Palace also in the square. Gorgeous displays, well priced and interesting history. Be prepared, though, it can be very warm inside the",
          "I'm personally am not a fan of visiting churches/cathedrals but this one truly amazed me. The attention to detail in the pictures is phenomenal. It also has a tranquil feeling to it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in history and architecture.",
          "Went here as part of a sightseeing tour on a Princess cruise. After seeing many religious places around the world it is easy to describe it as \"just another place of worship\". In reality it is no different to what you will find in Europe. It is worth a visit and is visually",
          "We have been to the Vatican and many churches across our travels and this cathedral holds its own with any of the others. You quickly get a sense of how much the people of Peru have relished in the construction of their great churches. Beautiful.",
          "In Lima you get the feeling that there are not so many sightseeing places. The Cathedral its one of the few. Its a nice cathedral but what worths most is the catacombs under the cathedral which one should visit.",
          "if you want to take a look at what Peru was like in the past you must take a tour of the museum. I loved going into the catacombs and reading about the history of the place. plan to be there for at least for hours. The place is filled with interesting art and full of things to",
          "This Cathedral was visited twice by Pope John and it's easy to understand why. Peru is by far the most dominant Catholic country in the Americas and this Cathedral is a worthy reminder of its influence.",
          "This beautiful and beautifully maintained church is worth a visit. Pizarro's tomb and the mosaics are here, and a must-see is the nearby Museo y Catacumbas, with the remains (skulls and bones) of thousands. Fascinating!",
          "huge place - lots of incredible carvings above altars lining the main sanctuary , really great artwork. Centrally located w/in the plaza de armas - nestled within lots of really cool nearby sites in a very safe part of downtown lima.",
          "Well worth a visit... Huge scale spectacular building.... Religious paraphenalia gone mad! But very impressive. Beautifully maintained. Great tranquil space in the middle of this hectic city.... Many shrines and religious pictures... Rich in the history of the Spanish",
          "Personaly, not a big fan of visiting cathedrals but if you are in el centro historico you should see it. Admission price includes a guide in your language. Also see the catherdral museum next door. Highlight of the cathedral, for me, is the mural showing Pizarro, the conqueror,",
          "Very grand. Representative of the might and importance of church in Peru history. Splendid building from outside, even more impressive from inside. The price we paid included the visit to the next door archbishop's palace . Both are beautifully maintained and just gorgeous.",
          "I am not religious but all I can say is that the churches and cathedrals here in Lima are stunning. If you have some time do visit them do so. They are so beautiful. I am sure you will take lots of pictures",
          "The Cathedral is magnificent and dominates Lima's main square. Lots of stories and archeology discovered over the years and multiple renovations. Well worth the visit for people of all religions.",
          "Looking for something to do we decided to visit this cathedral. It was ok. It passed the time but don't go in with your expectations too high,",
          "It is a VERY beautiful church. The service is always nice. The interior is one of the most beautiful sites. They allow you to roam freely inside the mail part of the church. It is a good place to sit and reflect on your thoughts.",
          "I didn't go inside, but it is wide open and visible from outside. Definitely worth a look while you're around the Plaza de Armas.",
          "Basilica with a museum. There are multiple chapels inside dedicated to different saints. In the basement they have historical tombs. Very interesting historical place to visit.",
          "Beautiful cathedral, steeped in history and treasures. A place to visit every day and enjoy a bit of colonial history of Latin America. Very good guided tours in Spanish and English.",
          "This cathedral is really amazing with a lot of Arts and history if the Catholic church was to sell everything no one on earth will be starving",
          "Wonderful outside and within. The main outside facade includes the ornate Portada del Perdon - the door of forgiveness, with the doorway surrounded by statues of saints. Several chapels inside the cathedral contain beautiful scuptures and paintings.",
          "Muy in teresante historia de Lima sus fundador Francisco Pizarro y los virreyes en Lima y alrededores. You pay a fee and you get see everything. inside of it.",
          "We enjoyed our visit here. Our tour guide had lots to say. It is definitely an important church to see, even for non-believers as it helps you understand the Peruvian's beliefs. A must to see for those visiting Lima.",
          "Awesome sightseeing inside :) What a stunning church absolutely worth seeing. If you have the time go for a church service which has an awesome acoustic.",
          "The cathedral in Lima is a very impressive building with a number of features which we found unique. Quite an amazing experience guided by Ruth from Lima Tours.",
          "Our guide made the cathedral more interesting and intriguing than it might have been. Great stories and beautiful.",
          "This main cathedral of Lima fronts the Plaza de Armas and while impressive, does not overwhelm the square. The entrance is on the right side, and once inside, just to the right, is the mosaic chapel that contains the remains of Francisco Pizzaro. The interior, as well as the",
          "The striking features of this cathedral are its multiple chapels, the beauty of its art and decoration, and the impressive wood-carved choir stalls and external balcony. Pizarro founded the Cathedral, and it contains his tomb. Well worth a visit, which can be combined with one",
          "Totally disappointed.I have been to other church museums in Lima and was expecting much more. Entrance is S/.10.00 adult. If you want a guide, it is extra. They ask you to give the guide a tip. Hours: M-F 9-5 p.m. Sat: 10-1 p.m. Sunday: 1-p.m. We got a guide, she was not",
          "Amazing beautiful old cathedral, lovely to walk around the whole place and check out every aspect of it inside, since I am not catholic I probably can\u00b4t appreciate it like a methodist such as myself, but still breathtaking to take in.",
          "The side chapels were decorated at various times in the 17th-19th centuries. they are interesting and in some cases quite beautiful. The crypts should not be missed. The nave itself has clearly been renovated long after the chapels were completed",
          "This is a lovely Cathedral. It is not far from the Plaza del Armas and can walk there from there, there are a lot of churches to see but this one is a should see.",
          "This is a great Cathedral. You can visit it when you are at the Plaza del Armas. It will take you less than 20 minutes.",
          "I was impressed with the followings. 1. Tomb of Francisco Pizarro with the detail explanation on how his bones were located in the tomb. 2. About 8 large rooms of the statues of Jesus. The statues were impressive from the point of view of art. 3. Many skulls and bones were",
          "This Cathedral is generally know as the best in South America and frankly that is no exaggeration. No only is it huge but it is in perfect condition and houses not only an excellent collection of art but multiple underground crypts. (If you like bones, the crypts nearby at the",
          "The best bit about this place was the relatively recent discovery of bodies and little crypts. Worth a look. I'd give the Archbishops Palace a miss though. Overpriced and a bit boring.",
          "A sense of mystery awaits you here. Splendid woodwork and art throughout this church. Complete the visit with a trip next door to the Archbishop's House/Palace, which is now a museum.",
          "Seemed a bit sparse and empty, quite uninteresting, more like a museum than a church, cant compare to the beautiful cathedral in Cusco with its colorful shrines.",
          "In the main area of Lima, we had our own guide for this tour. There are many landmarks in the same area you can visit.",
          "This Cathedral contains MANY chapels - each with its own and unique opulence. It is very worth a visit and rivals any Cathedral in the world for magnificence inside.",
          "This lovely cathedral was an interesting stop on our tour of Lima. We enjoyed the beautiful artwork and spectacular display of craftsmanship and detailing throughout.",
          "i really like this church is really awesome, after busy trip and good ending before come back home was great to come to one of the best churches i ever visited in south america",
          "Many Cathedral i had been but this very special especially open for public praying as well! It so holy and so great for me as tourist i am able to attending this special ceremony on Sunday as well!",
          "A must when visiting Lima. We used Viajes Pacifico through our agency in Panama and they are excellent",
          "Placed right next to the Plaza de Armas and very close to several other notorious churches and landmarks, this Cathedral makes for a mandatory visit in Lima. It's stunning, huge, well-preserved with tons of artwork and a special atmosphere.",
          "This cathedral was a lovely spiritual experience during our visit, While the Pisarro grave and tributes are off putting given the destruction of Incan civilization, the history and beauty in the cathedral are extraordinary. Not to be missed.",
          "Interesting history of the mirror image buildings, the fountain was the only structure intact after an earthquake",
          "Beautiful old cathedral, definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. 10 min should be enough for a good look around",
          "An interesting cathedral, no so ostentatious and those in Peru a few cracks from earthquakes visible but mostly in good condition. Located at the main square so easy to access.",
          "The cathedral is pretty for sure. Still Lima offers a bigger variety of churches, especially around Centro. If you are around anyways go take a look, you won't take longer than 5 min and you can appreciate its arquitecture. Not the best cathedral out there but not bad either",
          "Definitely worth stopping in to see the tomb of Fransisco Pizzaro. Also I was amazed by the art. Really it was up to European standards. Not something I expected in the americas. I also loved the painting of the kings of Peru. The Inkas followed by the Spainiards.",
          "The Lima Cathedral is conveniently located in Plaza de Armas. It's an imposing structure and the interiors are as statuesque and beautiful as any other major European cathedral I've seen. The chapels are beautiful and the main altar is pretty breathtaking.",
          "Having visited cathedrals in Europe, this compares with the best of them. This is a nice visit for the devout.",
          "Beautiful church, definitely a must visit when in downtown Lima. The architecture and the art are breath taking, also make sure you visit the museum.",
          "I was really impressed did not expect to see a cathedral of such caliber in Peru like this. It rivaled those I saw in Italy, Spain and London. So much history to learn as well.",
          "A really beautiful Cathedral, comparable to and in some respects finer than many of those visited in Europe.",
          "This is a beautiful \"tri-church\" cathedral with many interesting artifacts and stunning altars - in gold leaf and solid silver. It was amazing to see the energy and dedication that went into construction of these beautiful churches. You'll be very impressed with the beauty you",
          "Beautiful church interior. Note the black vultures that roost on its steeple. No fee. Elaborate colonial exterior.",
          "Located in the Plaza Mayor of downtown Lima, next to the Government Palace is a Roman Catholic cathedral. In its inside you can see the tomb of the spanish conqueror Francisco Pizarro and an interesting museum.",
          "To visit while sightseeing in the historical area of Lima .Nice to see the doors open and welcoming ,we were charged to go inside .",
          "Beautiful building worth the visit. Watch out for the black vulture of the condor family that perches on the steeple. No fee to visit the church. Situated in the historic centre of Lima and close to shopping pedestrian areas.",
          "Great cathedral to visit! Make sure you explore all the open doorways. We found a crypt at the back left which no one else seemed to have found. Guides are available but we wondered round at our own pace which was great for us.",
          "Very impressive inside! Beautiful church! Nice place to pray and visit! They also have masses during the day if you want to attend.",
          "One can say that there are a lot of beautyful Chatedrals all around the world, more than this one. It is true, but a visit to this chatedral can teach you a lot about the local culture, the influence and the power of the spanish conquerors and the mix born and grown from the",
          "Exquisite...with art and sculpture in excellent condition that equal that of Rome. Very few tour groups present. Photos permitted without flash.",
          "Cathedral largely turned into a museum of religious artifacts. The most interesting piece is the burial site of Francisco Pizarro (conquistador of Incas and founder of Lima) just to the right of the entrance. The tomb is surrounded by analyses (in Spanish only but with",
          "The church is very nice and I would recommend exploring the pathways along the sides that show previous excations, bones. I would really recommend getting a guide, as the signs throughout are only in Spanish. In additon to that they are sporadic and don't really give a lot of",
          "Lima\u2019s main cathedral is quite beautiful, located on the main plaza in the historic city center. It isn\u2019t the most noteworthy cathedral we\u2019ve ever visited, but definitely a nice stop if you\u2019re in the city center. There\u2019s also quite a collection of religious art.",
          "Anchoring one end of the Plaza de Armas, this is one of the most beautiful Cathedrals I have visited around the world. It is also one of the few in Peru that allows photos. There is a small admission charge of 10 Sol (about $3) and is worth it even if you have only a few",
          "The place is beautiful, full of art pieces everywhere. The guides must be requested at the start of the visit. It helps to know some history of Peru to understand some artwork . It has a small store of memories. I recommend making the journey before noon , and take advantage of",
          "This is a huge cathedral, modeled on that of Seville. However, appearances can be deceptive. The quality of the paintings and ornamentation is very poor compared with European counterparts. The cathedral is notable for the tomb of Francisco Pizzaro, the illiterate Spanish thug",
          "The cathedral of Lima was a beautiful site. We certainly enjoyed visiting this beautiful building on our trip to Lima!",
          "Lots of history - main focus point of the city. Lots of catholic culture - old, but keeps its charm and attraction. Nice to visit - spend day around the plaza.",
          "Very beautiful, interesting structures of the altar, in the main chapel and side. The cost is affordable and the visit is very suggestive.",
          "You get a guided tour in English, which is rare and you can see a lot of things during an hour tour, roughly. If you are fond of religion etc this is a unique place indeed. Otherwise, have a coffee and visit the classic museums in the area.",
          "Beautiful church. Made me think of Europe and many of the old churches there with the art work and the amazing alter. The catacomb underneath was small but different. Enjoyed the visit.",
          "This comes with the ticket price. It is well done. You have to ask for it at a booth. It reviews the religious art and includes history. Without it you are simply looking at items you know little to nothing about much less missing their context.",
          "This cathedral is truly magnificent. It has a unique architecture that resembles early 1500 Spanish colonial-type. The cathedral itself is located in the Plaza Mayor. If you take a closer look, the central part of the cathedral is quite older than the more relatively modern",
          "We've seen hundreds of cathedrals in our decades of travel, and easily give them a pass these days--but this one is worth it, The religious art has some special features, and the Pizarro grave (whether wholly or in part) is fascinating. It is best to have a good guide for",
          "A pleasant surprise, this is an awsome cathedral, a must see when in Lima, it shows all the Spanish influence, we've visited this place twice this year and love it.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit if you love history and architecture. You will not only learn stories from the cathedral and the foundation of the catholic faith in Peru but also the evolution of art and design in Lima. The guides are well prepared. Totally recommend it!",
          "A visit to the Cathedral was much better than we thought. The self-guided brochures are pretty good; Pizarro's tomb is stunningly beautiful; and the Art Museum is worth a look!",
          "It's a must ....but make it as part of plaza de armas, changed of guards (before noon),limas city hall and visit sto. Domingo church where Santa Rosa de Lima and San Martin de Porras are buried and are to the right side of the major altar..( check times when church is",
          "The Cathedral is near the Plaza de Armas in the heart of Lima. There are a variety of stones--gray, white and cream from the 16th century and also newer stones from Panama in the 19th century. Nearby below the Convent of San Francisco, lie the Catacombs, an underground",
          "The entry fee is 10 soles (30 soles for a combined ticket with the museum next door- which I did not visit) however, the first chapel is the exhibition of Pizzaro's burial and they didn't check my ticket to go inside there. So if you're just interested in Pizzaro, you can",
          "We quickly visited on a Saturday afternoon after visiting the catacombs next door. After wondering around we realized that a wedding was taking place. We quietly left because it felt like we were crashing the event. Many people were milling about and taking photos with a flash",
          "As most colonial churches in South America, this is a fine cathedral. I wish they didn't charge the tourist fee, but what can you do.",
          "Great visit and amazing architecture and history. I wish we would have gotten a guide because all the history was written in Spanish. The gave us a flyer but not enough to appreciate the culture and history.",
          "I went to this cathedral for Easter Sunday mass with my parents and is was the most beautiful building with the most reverent atmosphere I'd ever been to. The mass was lovely and later that week we returned to see the cathedral as tourists and the detailing on virtually",
          "I am not used to pay an entrance fee when visiting a Cathedral so it took me a few minutes to decide whether I wanted to get in or not. That been said I would totally pay the fee again cause the church is so beautiful and well kept that it made sense. I payed the fee to walk",
          "An early taster of the many ornate churches we would see on our tour. Restoration work has revealed some ancient pictures which have been beautifully restored.",
          "Like many, we went as part of a group (NGS). As a result you go through at a certain pace that may or may not suit you. There are many things--from the altars to the paintings--you'll want to spend more time with. Traveler Tip: Don't miss the Last Supper.",
          "The building was impressive with it's high ceilings and mahogany carvings. There are individual rooms used for worshiping by individual families a long time ago. Tombs were discovered underneath the building a few years ago and you can see some of this through a glass floor.",
          "Silver, silver gold ,gold. Wow great guide Silver ,silver gold gold do we realyy have to use one hundred characters. tour well worth it",
          "Hundreds churchs at Lima but this is the best, Really is magnificient. You need pay the ticket fee and ENJOY",
          "If you show up on the weekend, you can see lots of weddings-- it will be interesting people watching to be sure! We went on a Friday and we managed to see parts of 3 weddings while we visited other sights around the plaza. The interior of the church is very ornate.",
          "We included the cathedral on our walking tour and were not sorry. Our guide provided us with a solid review of this church and its construction as a part of helping us understand Peruvian history.",
          "Everyone who enjoys religious architecture and art should stop at Lima's beautiful cathedral located at the Plaza Downtown. A must-visit.",
          "The Cathedral of Lima was one of my favorite things we saw in the city. The entrance fee was a little pricer than other sites, (we purchased a double ticket with the Archbishop's Residence) but well worth the price. There are a variety of altars and even the bones of the",
          "In the mayor plaza of Lima, near the Palace of the president, beside the arzobisp building, Near other sites just waling a few blocks",
          "Having seen cathedrals in Italy and even the one in Quito, Ecuador, this one is not at all impressive, both in architecture or art it contains.",
          "Don't miss this landmark and be sure to get the back story. Conveniently located and a wondrous site to stroll through. Pause to enjoy!",
          "This cathedral is beautiful without being overly ornate. The ceilings are quite interesting. We were there on a Sunday morning and I felt a bit guilty intruding on the service in progress, but it was worth seeing. And, unlike most churches in South America, you are allowed to",
          "This cathedral is centrally located infront of the Plaza de Las Armas in Lima. Like every single church or building in the city proper, this church is interesting and beautifully built with lots of architectural details. If you are walking around the city, this should be one of",
          "Ten soles to enter. Impressive cathedral with many extensively carved and guilded side altars. Well worth a look.",
          "For a rich country, culturally and historically, the Cathedral is not so impressive as we expected. Compared to other churches in Latin American or even Peru itself it is not so well decorated. The Pizarro grave is the main point.",
          "I'm not a fan of huge cathedrals, but this one is worth the visit, and has been kept very well for centuries it seems. Lots beautiful chapels around the sides and clergy buried in basement vaults.",
          "Interesting colonial cathedral with spectacular artwork and some incredible gold and silver work. The treasury was lovely.",
          "I went on a Monday when there is the changing of the guards at mid day and well worth a look. The Cathedral is just across the square so if there worth a look in. Not very exciting but if there go in.",
          "I tried to go in the Cathedral to visit but they tried to charge me 50 soles just to go in. I have been there before but that was the first time people tried to make money out of me going to a church. There is La Merced Basilica close by you can go in without paying anything",
          "We enjoyed out visit here. This is a large beautiful Cathedral. it is well worth the visit, if for no other reason to view the location of the crypt of Pizarro. However, this is a beautiful historic museum, not a place for worship. We enjoyed the crypt under the alter.",
          "The golden altar at the private section never seen this in a church and then the Silver Altar in the main section. Pity not allowed to take pictures.",
          "This cathedral is an important part of Lima's history and includes the remains of Francisco Pizzaro plus many other figures from Lima's past. Really worth the visit.",
          "Old Spanish style church. Part of our tour of Lima by International Expeditions. What a beautiful church and such a great place to visit. Old Town Lima is filled with old structures, which mean a lot to the people of Lima. They still hold services in there",
          "The tour is well worth it. Try to get a sense of the richness and beauty of Christian liturgy in this majestic place. There are some rare pieces such as Our Lady of Evangelization, a carving from the 16th century, wonderfully restored and preserved. Right next to it, in the same",
          "The Cathedral is locatedin the Plaza de Armas, so it is one of the sites that you must go in and admire, if are European, you have seen like this a few, but the altars and the catacombs are worth a view, must be visited.",
          "My wife and I visited this cathedral in mid april of 2015. It was part of our \"Discover Peru\" tour. We enjoyed our visit very much ! The crypt was quite interesting and the statues and wood carvings were all very impressive.",
          "Do not get to see nice places like this. Is very old and is well taking care off. The best time to visit is in the daytime because at night might be closed.",
          "The Cathedral is a study stone, with Romanesque columns, building. There is a semi circular alter with Our Lady's statue lit up with shining blue lights. Lovelylife like side alter statues and lovely colourful stained glass windows.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful and worth a visit. However, if you have toured Europe then you won't find it exceptional. The crypt is interesting if you don't mind looking at skulls.",
          "This gave us the insight of the Peruvian catholic customs and traditions. It was interesting to see the catacombs. It reminded us of the Catacombs in Paris but in a smaller scale.",
          "This is your average cathedral built in the 1800's after an earthquake. It had nothing except the bones in the basement to make it worth your time. I also found the square very boring except for the buzzards circling the cathedral.",
          "I'm personally not that into churches, but this one is definitely worth a visit. It's very pretty, and it's one of the main attractions of central Lima. There's a peaceful quiet that engulfs you when you walk in, and the downstairs catacombs are pretty cool.",
          "Lima's beautiful Basilica has the traditional facade of three large doors with 2 towers that are neoclassical with stylistic influence, once inside it is breathtaking. The paintings and images on display are quite lovely. Worth a visit when in Lima City Centre.",
          "Beautiful is the best word to describe it. It really encapsulates the spirit and influence of Spanish cathedrals with the Latin American touch. A delightful place to visit!",
          "A key building in Lima . Like most city centre cathedrals it has an atmosphere which infects the surrounding square and buildings",
          "I was able to enter and for a few soles more I was given a tour in English. The tour guide was very knowledgable in the cathedral and she took my group through the enitre church including the catecombs and behind the sanctuary so that we could see all the dramatic details of",
          "Located in the Plaza Mayor of Lima, this is a Catholic Cathedral from the 16th century with a baroque style which is beautifully decorated.... should not miss while in Lima",
          "Take a tour and check out the catacombs at the bottom of the cathedral. You will be astounded to see how the skeletal remains have been grouped. While the artwork and interior architectural design is of interest, make it a point to check out the painting of The Last Supper",
          "Paid for a guided tour of the Cathedral, well worth it. Fascinating blend of Christian and local artisan art which you need a guide to point out. The Spanish did many things wrong in Peru, but this treasure in the Lima's main plaza is not one of them. A must see to appreciate",
          "This cathedral has also survived major earthquakes. Francisco Pizarro's remains are here.Pizarro found and conquered Peru. He was also the person who designated this land for the cathedral. The cathedral 's interior is nice and well worth a visit.",
          "This overlooks Lima's main plaza. It is a showpiece of Roman Catholic religious art, with 10 private chapels on each side of the main nave. Each of these is dedicated to a saint, and they seem to compete with each other for ornate magnificence and lush ornamentation. The main",
          "An interesting way of learning about Lima\u00b4s history, see how the city evolved and visit the catacombs underneath the altar. If you are ok reading the signs and booklets, you may get away without a guide, but they certainly tell you much more than what is there to read.",
          "Was great inside, wonderful chapels and altars, and the stonework on the outside was fascinating, explaining the heritage of the Incas.",
          "Pissaro's tomb (discovered Peru); superb assortment of side altars that almost over shadow the intricate main altar, wonderful carvings throughout. Be sure to get the Dual ticket that allows entrance to the Archbishop's Palace next door. Sneak peek into the luxurious life of the",
          "The Lima cathedral on one side of the Plaza de Armas is steeped in history. The first stone was laid in the 16th venture by the conquistador Pizzaro. It's a huge beautiful church with a beautiful altar and many side altars. Well worth the 10 soles admission",
          "Beautiful Church located in the Plaza D' Armas area. The church is however too new in architecture to be made a significant visit. It has the remains of Fransisco Pizarro. I would give it a skip if i don't have much time. There is however a cool library upstairs accessible",
          "Peru is a religious country and the Cathedrals and the churches were built when the Spanish invaded Peru. The gold and jewel encrusted statues are breath taking",
          "Got a complete tour in english of the cathedral which was nice but comparing to the ones in Europe it does not compare. The outside is much more impressive than the inside. However what was interesting was the way it has been rebuilt to within stand earthquakes. The pillars are",
          "A must visit place. As an Architect, I love to visit the historic places and the Cathedral of Lima is one of them.",
          "As Lima\u2019s primary cathedral, it is a grand and ornate as you would expect. The Pizarro family tomb is about the second chapel on the right as you enter the cathedral. Pizarro\u2019s mosaic work is particularly impressive. They hold mass on Sunday mornings, which means that entry",
          "Franicsco Pizzaro is entombed here near the entrance. Typical Spanish style outside and made of stone. The interior has a bit less gold than is typical of European churches (for sad obvious reasons), but still it is beautiful inside. Painted wood carvings and stone. A",
          "The Cathedral of Lima is located on the Plaza Mayor/Plaza de Armas and you should make time to visit the Cathedral when you visit the Plaza. I think we have all visited churches, cathedrals and monasteries and this one is similar to many but also different from most. The",
          "The wood and intimate carvings in this Cathedral are truly impressive. If you're visiting the Plaza Mayor make sure to take some time to stroll through.",
          "Much more impressed with Cathedral in Cusco. Artwork and building structure were not very inspiring, and our guide's interpretation of historical events was inaccurate.",
          "the cathedral of a huge city as lima can't help being majestic. it's located just in plaza de armas and it observes severe the whole city from there. worth a visit",
          "The Cathedral is located on the Plaza Mayor. We arranged for a taxi to the Plaza Mayor from our hotel in Miraflores. We paid for admission to the Cathedral and of the Archbishop's Palace Museum. We did not pay for a guide but followed the brochure to visit the various chapels",
          "Per\u00fa is a very catholic country and the Lima Cathedral is beautiful, as well as the other old churchs surrounding the town centre.",
          "history is there. not old as in europe but sitll very impressive and interesting. make sure you have your camera charged and enough memory on the card. best to get few linse - close up and long shoot.",
          "The carvings and silver & gold on the altars and chapels were magnificent. It was a cool, quiet stop on a warm day.",
          "The Lima Cathedral is patterned after some of the notable cathedrals in Spain. It lives up to the precedent. Magnificent, spacious, beautiful ceiling, a fabulous front area. Not to be missed. Ticket price as of this date was about $3 USD",
          "It is a nice Cathedral, but there are nicer if you travel around Perou and 25soles to enter !!!!!!and not allowed to take any picture. Rita",
          "The mother ship of all churches in Lima, the cathedral is gigantic but there are more beautiful churches in Lima in my opinion. If you come to downtown Lima you should check it out.",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the heart of the city in front of the Plaza Mayor (Plaza de Armas). Old architecture use impressive walls.",
          "A nice church and a museum of the history of Peruvian Vice-Royalty catholicism. The museum is a very good representation of art and history and the guides are very good",
          "Great tours avaiable and worth taking the time to visit. Get a guide to explain what you're seeing. Easy walk and from there you can visit the Palacio and watch the changing of the guards!",
          "I'm impressed by the beauty of this cathedral. Nice paintings, vitrage and prayerful atmosphere. Located around the Plaza Mayor makes your tripa wonderful experience",
          "It's very old historical church in Lima with rich furniture and decoration. It's placed on central square Plasa de Armas. There is a tomb of Francisco Pizzaro, first ruler of Lima inside the Cathedral.",
          "Were there the day the Cusco parishes were blessed - church was overflowing. Participants paraded around the city. Very colorful.",
          "I have seen many cathedrals both here and in Europe. These seem even more gaudy than Europe which I didn't think possible. We had a good guide and didn't t spend too much time there.",
          "It a limit access church. It a beautiful church and you can go in but they will limit you not able to explore more and only be views from the entrance. That pretty much it.",
          "You must go and feel the ancestral magia of this Church, and surroundings, Peru has a great combination of Colonial and local indians that makes the places beautiful",
          "In the historic district, this is a must see. It's spectacular and well worth spending an hour or so visiting!!",
          "I loved this cathedral. After seeing almost every one in Europe and GB ,this was a pleasant experience. Especially with the Inca mother and child outside begging with a bag of penny candy. Extremely well appointed with religious artifacts and depections of how all the priests",
          "Not very impressive especially if you have seen a few European cathedrals. Other than it is old not much happened here. Lots of Ecclesiastical garb, altar pieces and stuff that is not all that interesting unless you care it was used or worn by a particular past Pope .",
          "So much of Peru's history is wrapped up in colonization. See Pizarro's celebrated tomb in this cathedral to get an interesting perspective.",
          "After paying 30$ for both and getting tickets,was decided not to look around by ourself,but to add to the english speaking group.That was the best decision!I don't remember the name of that guide, but the way how he tells you about this Cathedral so expressive and impressive",
          "There are some nice underground catacombs in the cathedral. There is a museum too but I didn\u00b4t visit it, you can pay to visit the cathedral ($10) or you can pay for both ($30).",
          "The problem with a lot of these guidebook must-sees is that they are not all that interesting. This is a beautiful cathedral, to be sure, but I've seen cathedrals on four continents. Enough!",
          "I realy love the place, is magical. I was there for a weeding and i Love it! Its like going back in time. ALl the furniture, the gold, the images, eveerything is beautiful.",
          "Very good Cathredral to visit,clots of unique history - there is free guided tour included with entrance (tip optional) in English + Spanish and maybe other languages - very interesting to hear about Pizzaro and other parts of it.",
          "This is a very beautiful cathedral. We really enjoyed the tour and were glad we had a guide that had a lot of knowledge. We were quite surprised to find out that they do not accept the American Dollar for the tour, so be sure you have some Peruvian Sols with you before you go",
          "really enjoyed exploring and learning the history. My wife and I enjoy visiting the historic churches of the cities we visit",
          "Go with a guide and get to know the details of this place. Don't forget the catacombs - skip if you are claustrophobic and don't like human remains... Look out for details to enlighten your experience.",
          "It is not the largest, nor the richest of churches in Per\u00fa. Nevertheless it contains an interesting collection of historical elements. Pizzarro's tomb and a museum of sacred art.",
          "Not as beautiful as I thought it was going to be. I guess the Spanish took all the good stuff. I like San Francisco with all its bones more.",
          "This was second visit to the cathedral but this time i used a guide picked up inside. She gave the tour in English and I learned so much more about the building and its history. Very beautiful",
          "Would have liked more time to spend in the Cathedral, but time was limited. They do allow photos without flash.",
          "Unfortunately again , visits are during ceremonies only ! It is beneficial to visit with a guide as there are many unique points that we shall not notice without a guide. The place is huge with many paintings and wood works - consider visiting twice ...",
          "Do a city tour and make sure to include the Cathedral of Lima. This is a beautiful part of the city that most people would not normally visit... Make sure and visit!",
          "Not much to tell. It is a must see of Lima. I wont ruin the surprise but I promise you, it will leave you thankful you went to see.",
          "Not impresed with the quality of guides in this country. poor english skills, you have to pay to get into a church. no no. not recommed a city tour. just walk around and next morning go away go to Cuzco.",
          "The one to visit IMHO ... Grand, large, well preserved eryainly not European standard but a great gem in Lima",
          "Underground catacombs are a bunch of old bones who are the remains of people that were buried under the church. Skulls, all the leg bones etc.. Was creepier than my liking but very interesting nonetheless. Low ceilings underground so if you are taller than 5'9\" prepare to duck",
          "I really wanted to visit this beautiful cathedral because the tour took in the catacombs which are something that I have never experienced before. I had looked forward to the experience and although it was very interesting and the cathedral beautiful, I found the catacombs",
          "Truly a grand Cathedral that Lima can be proud of from a grand bygone era. I would have liked to spend more time exploring all of it's glory.",
          "Its an obligatory stop on colonial Lima but only get the 10 soles entrance to visit the cathedral, they always try to sell you the 30 soles entrance ticket including the achbishops palace but that other place doesn't woth visit.",
          "First of all, the cathedral allows use of cameras inside. Mine needs no flash in low light, so I was able to take many pictures. The church contains interesting catacombs, and also the tomb of Pizarro. But what sets it apart from many other churches is the collection of",
          "Had some time to explore so we went to the cathedral. It was an interesting experience especially seeing the catacombs.",
          "If you can ignore just how this and others of it kind came about via murder,treachery & plunder...you cannot but admire the fine wood carvers work or that of the gold everywhere. A Catholic delight I suspect but I find history crowding out some of the enjoyment,for me at least.",
          "The cathedral is full of beautiful paintings and sculptures. Despite it's large size it seems \"cozy\". We attended a wedding there. It was a beautiful celebration. Unlike churches in Cusco, there is no entrance fee.",
          "More than just a Church, it's a big museum inside, with many interesting artifacts. They have free tours once you're in, we didn't take it and were free to wonder into every room, including the catacombs.",
          "Excellent example of Spanish colonial architecture. Grand, imposing interior. To the right of the entrance there's the tomb of Francisco Pizarro. A small museum of religious art entrance is located to the left of the altar",
          "Enjoyed visiting the Cathedral and seeing the resting place of Pizarro. The cathedral was very beautiful.",
          "This cathedral is immense inside with a long history and has been reconstructed a couple of times due to earthquakes. Before entering you can't help being amazed at the exterior reminiscent of the Spanish colonial era. There are three highly decorated doorways in the front",
          "One of the most special things I have ever encountered was the church service in the Cathedral of Lima. I was amazed that visitors were allowed to enter during worship. I am not Catholic but to hear the amazing male a capella voice emanating to the plaza and the response from",
          "This is indeed a spectacular cathedral. It's huge! I thought there wore 3 cathedrals joined together, but no, its just one! The details inside are amazing, not to mention the altars. The lighting makes a big difference, because it give every single piece its glory time. Amazing!",
          "This is the Biggest Church in Peru an it's located in the Plaza Mayor, Building at the Colonial time, the construction began in 1535, the first stone was laid for the conqueror Francisco Pizarro, contains the tomb of this conqueror.the front facade has thress large doorway, the",

          "a very nice cathedral in the centre of town, worth a visit, very peaceful and lovely stained glass windows",
          "It is worth a visit if you are in the city centre, but wouldn't come here solely to see the cathedral.",
          "There are a number of chapels and without a guide it may be a waste. With a guide it becomes comprehensible. Certainly worth short visit if in the area but wouldn't go out of my way unless you are a student of religious art",
          "It doesn't matter how many churches you have visited in Europe, Latin America, or the United States, visiting this cathedral has a historical reference and a artistic value that is worth a visit. We spent three wonderful hours visiting both the cathedral and the religious art",
          "Is a must to visit this historical cathedral and its museum. Lovely presentations of concerts and chorus once in a while. Located in the main square of downtown Lima it is surrounded by the Presidential Palace and Mayor Palace too.",
          "Peeked inside, but didn't appear worth the entrance fee. Worth a visit to see the architecture, though. Recommend as part of a tour of historical city center--not an independent destination.",
          "The Catherdral is lovely. There is some amazing artwork and areas you can walk into to see the tombs. It has beautiful architecture.",
          "Some sites say this is free but in fact you have to pay approx USD $3 - this gives you access to the museum inside the Cathedral. There is a $10 ticket if you want to do the adjoining Archbishop's Palace as well. We did not, and were in the Cathedral for about 2 hours. This",
          "Part of the cathedral is free to visit for praying and quite reflection. The other part is an religious art museum and you have to pay 12 soles entry. It is very nice and definitely worth a visit.",
          "While my husband and I enjoyed the catacomb section of the tour, the rest was unneeded. We were taken over the entire church. Too tiring and long.",
          "We stopped by for no particular reason, but we were really amazed. So much to see and so much to read. The added excitement of the crypts below some of the side chapels did not make things worse. As an added bonus, there is a very nice cafe in a small internal courtyard towards",
          "I visited as part a city tour real nice place to visit also visited the Crypts walking round this area which was full nones a little strange but it's part the tour",
          "Again did not spend enough time here, was part of a tour, so it was in and out.. If I would do it again, I would go by taxi",
          "Have seen so many cathedrals in Europe and not sure it ranks highly - if you are in the area to see the Plaza and government buildings, it is definitely worth a few minutes but otherwise, not worth a special trip.",

          "The Cathedral is a place to see, specially the catacombs (not very large), the psalm books, the paintings and all of the church vestments and offerings. There is a small entrance fee and you can get a combined ticket to see other sites around the Main Square",
          "Book a city tour and they will take you to the cathedral an take you to the katakumbas or underground cemetery.They give you a very good explanation.Bad thing they don't give you too much time to buy religious items that they sell there.Ask for that and you will get some",

          "If you are in Lima and like beautiful Churches this is truly a must see. Pizarro is entombed here and there are catacombs(small but nice). it is a wondrous and beautiful Cathedral well worth the time. I am into history and this was worth it.",
          "Worth the time to tour. Our guide was quite knowledgable and the historical information was interesting. The cathedral is reminiscent of the grand European churches (not surprising), with a few distinct differences. There are catacombs underneath (very dank smelling)."

          "This was not as picturesque as I was led to believe. It wasn't dirty or filled with people hawking goods...but it was just a bridge. It was not special in any way. (The bridge in Hoi An, Vietnam, was special.) The little park nearby was much better - lots of flowers and",

          "Located in the hipster/artsy neighborhood of Lima (think Brooklyn-esque), the bridge draws many tourists with selfie sticks. Yes, it has great views overlooking the ocean, but nothing that special, especially considering the name draws from the famed bridge in Cambridge (UK)",
          "I'm not sure why I had such high hopes for this place, but I was a little disappointed once arriving. I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was full of families wielding selfie sticks making it almost impossible to take a leisurely stroll without getting a face full of iPhone. It",

          "OK, so not to be offensive, I don't get what the big deal is with this. It's a simple wooden bridge. The surrounding area is more interesting than this structure, but maybe that's the point? Definitely worth a visit to the Barranco area as the artsy bohemian vibe is really",
          "This bridge has a legend, so lovers must hold hands when crossing it to ensure they will remain together - a fun aside in the Barranco district.",
          "Not sure what we expected as the entire area has amazing parks, architecture and views. But the bridge itself is meh.... The real deal is the pathway down to the ocean through the cliffs. This entire area of Barranco is a must see if in Lima, not as touristy as MIRAFLORES and",

          "Well sigh we did when we arrived here and thought \"is that it\". We didn't know the history of it though to be fair. The advantage of visiting this bridge was to see the local area around it. Some great restaurants, small art galleries, the walk to the beach, the giant ant,",

          "Since this was the 'main' attraction in Barranco, our expectations were high. This is more of an overpass (than a bridge), overlooking multiple old buildings and restaurants. You can see the ocean, barely, if you are standing in the middle of the bridge.",
          "There is a walkway to the sea, the Bajada de los Ba\u00f1os, that runs through Barranco with lots of murals and street art. Crossing over this walkway is the Puente de los Suspiros, or Bridge of Sighs, a bridge which crosses the ravine. According to legend, if you make a wish and you",

          "This is about the best museum in Lima. BUT make sure it's open.........because now it's closed until who knows when after the collapsed roof can be fixed. (The guard told us that......)",
          "not to be missed, you will have the experience to seea lot ofeverything about all these amazing perouvian cultures. Nice area too",
          "You cannot come in Lima even it's for working like me and forgive this precolombian museum> The peru history is here.",
          "As of May 9 2019, the museum is closed. There's a lot of confusion: this is not the Museo Nacional de Peru, and it is not the (excellent) Museo Larco! There is no mention of the closure on their Website or Facebook page, so I would recommend calling them before you plan your",
          "Our hotel staff told us that Peruvians were not big museum goers. We nearly had this excellent Museum to ourselves. It's a bit out of the way in an area that might be described as sketchy, but the Museum itself is excellent. It begins with early Peru and its civilizations and",
          "This should surely be the flagship museum in Peru. But despite having many lovely things it is let down by several things: there is only any explanatory text in english for the first half of the rooms, and the staff seem disinterested. Also, when I visited in 1979 there was an",
          "I have been in this museum as a child and that was more than 20 years ago and I can say I am impressed on how well maintained and clean it is. They have a huge collection of items from different towns and cultures in Peru. They have a small restaurant with a basic menu, so it",
          "The National Museum of Archeology, Anthropology, and History is located in Pueblo Libre, a suburb 5 kilometers west of downtown Lima. It is worth the trip. I have visited here several times in the past 20 years, but it had been 4 or 5 years since the last time I visited. The",
          "Very cleverly organised with a variety of settings and ways of interacting. Good to see lots of school kids there too. I loved the combination of interiors and exteriors on a warm January day. Every room is worth a visit but, for a European, the later colonial to republic",
          "Very well maintained and organized. It offers a good view of Peru history. It is important to visit this museum to better understand Peru regions.",
          "We met a Peruvian back home and she recommended Puerto Libre (the neighborhood) as a way to engage with real Peruvians in Lima. This place isn't that touristy, so no beggars or people selling things, etc. She told us to go to this museum. BEST recommendation ever... I",
          "Loved this museum and highly recommended. I actually prefered it over Museo Larco because of the collection it has and the way it portrays Peruvian history. For 20 soles you get an hour of private tour with a passionate tour guide. I forgot her name but she was amazing and",
          "A relaxed deep dive into the history of the region. I did a great deal of \"who knew this\" after being exposed to the old and rich history of these different groups. Kids would find it somewhat interesting too.",
          "Incas are a key feature of Peruvian history BUT, once you visit the museum you'll find much more history than just the Incas - surprising to see all the previous historical communities revealed. Peru appears to do well in preserving and collecting artifacts and bits of their",
          "The museum is very large. It took us 3 hours to see its exposition. It shows the history of Peru from ancient times. There a lot of interesting and unique exponates.",
          "The most spectacular of all the material in display in this museum are the famous Paracas textiles. The museum has been extensively renovated and the textiles are a very prominent part of the museum.",
          "This museum combines archaeology with anthropology. The result is a little schizophrenic and disjointed. The archaeology part is better seen at Museo Larco, but the history part is super. You get a real understanding of the progression of the people and culture all the way up",
          "This museum was a bit of a disappointment. It was within walking distance of the place we stayed in Pueblo Libre, but I would not return.",
          "It is a relatively large museum in Peru standard, occupying two big court yards with several very large show room. The exhibition is well organized and categorized by region and timeline. Should visit this place to get a large picture in your mind before you visit real site in",
          "We went here after visiting Museo Larco (also fabulous and def worth a visit). This museum has a concise and broad range of information. I liked how each room was divided into Pre-Inca and Inca cultures. Lots of pottery, tools, textiles, etc. Also provides good info about",
          "Big museum of Archaeology and History from the very beginning to the mankind to the current days. Close to Larco Museum and ~10 minutes from the center (by Uber).",
          "No the best location but worth the visit for its historical perspective, Well staffed and a nice coffee shop.",
          "It's a nice museum with loads of information on peruvian history. Approx. 70% is available on both spanish and english, the rest in spanish only. I would have loved to have more interactive parts (there are at least some), but that's also due to personal preference. I",
          "I spent 3 hours in the museum which is beautifully displayed and has English wall labels. It is also situated in a park like setting with small shops and places to buy snacks. Stepped outside for a drink on a bench enjoying the birds and scenery before going back in for",
          "My visit was part of a larger tour, otherwise it is not worth seeing. There is room after room of old relics, bunch of old masks and faces. Really? How many of these do you want to see?",
          "I loved all the history relating to the peoples before the arrival of the Spanish. I had a great guide. Great museum.",
          "Good collection of items, organised well. Unfortunate if your Spanish is only conversational like mine is, because only 3/~15 exhibits have English translations. Lots of empty spaces as well, and got lost a few times. Plenty of friendly faces willing to help me back to the",
          "Plan to spend some time here and do hire a docent to help you get a better understanding of the history and to connect the dots. As we were told, if the history of Peru were a 2-hour movie, the Inca empire that we all hear about would only be the last 10 minutes. So much to",
          "The museum is perfect to have an in depth knowledge of the different cultures that ruled Peru through centuries, but the exhibition is very old and should be upgraded and modernized.",
          "Pre-Incan pottery and artifacts; Simon Bolivar stayed in the building, and his living quarters are recreated.",
          "Excellent exhibits here. You can learn a whole lot in a short time at this Museum. There is a beautiful courtyard inside with a fantastic garden if you want to sit and relax a few minutes surrounded by trees and flowers. I think it was only 10 Soles admission, that's pretty",
          "This museum covers the history of the pre hispanic cultures and a little bit of the colony and the r\u00e9publique. it\u2019s nice and I would recommend to come here first and then go to the Larco Museum, in that order.",
          "Really enjoyed this museum learning about the Peruvian history and culture. Our guide was really good explaining everything we seen in great detail. There were some fantastic artefacts, my favourite was a colourful weaving that has been fantastically preserved - see the attached",
          "I enjoyed the early part of the museum with the Peruvian/Inka history. As we ventured into the Spaniard history, the vibe was different and I didn't enjoy it as much. Not to say it wasn't curated well, it was, just my personal interest in Spaniard invasion got me off side! It's",
          "A decent museum with a lot of interesting artefacts. About half of the exhibitions have decent signs in english or german or spanish. And some are very modern while others are very old fashioned in the way they are set up. Unfortunatley there was no guide fluent in english when",
          "I prefered this over Museo Larco, simply because it was far more diverse in its displays (not only limited to ceramics). You learn about the entire history of Peru, beginning from the pre-Incan era until the post-Spanish colonialization.",
          "One should definitely visit this museum to see the history of lima and a very enjoyable and amazing place also for tourists and childrens as well",
          "I taxied all the way there to find it was closed on a Tuesday. Maybe it had to do with NYear?? But sad as it was my #1 thing to do in Lima. Lucky the Larco was open & it was great",
          "This is a very detailed museum showing several population that lived in Peru since 8000 AC until modern times. I suggest to take a guide in museum entrance to help to better understanding. Visit takes about 2 hours.",
          "If you're interested in pre-Columbian and Colonial art and history, then you need to visit this museum. The exquisite collections are professionally presented with timelines and very informative texts.",
          "The museum was huge and very interesting. We visited on Sunday afternoon and the crowds were thinning. Do try and visit independently as i noticed that the people on the group tours were only taken into a limited number of rooms leaving other areas free and uncrowded for the",
          "You will be hard pressed to find a better collection of Peruvian pottery and textiles. The pottery is delightful. Not formal, but whimsical and well crafted. The condition of some of the textiles is not to be believed. Color and craftsmanship preserved by the cool dry",
          "A lot of the displays are Spanish only, although some do have English, the newest ones. The docents, if you speak Spanish, are willing to talk you through the displays they are in charge of. This really adds an extra layer. Don't miss the more recent history of Peru, accessed",
          "The museum is located on Plaza Bol\u00edvar and houses the entire history of human occupation in what is now Peru. If your time allow you to visit only one museum in Lima, this is the museum to be visited.",
          "This museum has a very important collection of pieces. I especially liked the Paracas exhibit. If you want to know more about Peruvian ancient history you must come here.",
          "We enjoyed many of the exhibits at this museum, especially the spectacular collection of textiles. I think we spent about 2 hours here. The courtyard garden was also lovely.",
          "This a place to start when touring Lima . It gives you an overall history of Peru . Situated in the residence of Simon Bolivar when he was in Lima.",
          "This museum is really two museums in one. Divided into pre-Columbian and post periods, one gets a great sense of the rich history of both time frames. The pre-Columbian textiles are amazing and the complex history of Spanish conquest and settlement is well documented. Take the",
          "Don't miss this place if you want to have a quick view in the incan history. Amazing the collection of mumies...",
          "The collection of this museum can be divided in two: the pre-Colombian stuff (fascinating with some of the textiles being particularly notable) and the post Columbian (rather specialised for an international visitor and, to my mind, a bit dull). The pre-Columbian stuff makes",
          "This is a very well done museum, though some parts are more \"up to date\" than others. There are other Plaza Bolivar's in Lima, so make sure you go to the one in Pueblo Libre, not the one near the Plaza de Armas.",
          "This is a great place to visit for a comprehensive view on the archaeology and history of Peru. Although a bit dusty and not as well presented as the nearby Museo Larco, it has broader coverage. We could have spent hours there, but had to rush through as we had a flight to",
          "A nice museum, but some of the exhibits were dated and only had descriptions in Spanish. The exhibit of the Incan burial scene was excellent.",
          "Much smaller than I expected. It contains parts of all historic p\u00e9riodes in Peru's history, but pre-colonial is most interesting and is fascinating. I visited in the morning and it was quiet, peaceful and plenty of chance to take in what I wanted. Beautiful ambiance. Definitely",
          "I was disappointed with the breadth of the holdings. Although I learned that there were many different pre-Incan cultures mostly what I could learn about them was the period in which they dominated and their pottery. There's a lot of pottery! Would be nice to see more",
          "Hadn't been for years but it is still an interesting museum which covers a wide breath of topics concerning Peru, its people and cultures. Not as good as the Larco museum but if you have the time go.",
          "This museum gives a thorough account of all the different archaeological and historical periods in Peru, including many pre-inca cultures. The focus is more on the structure of the societies than on particular historical events. It has many replicas and some original artefacts",
          "I only had one day in Lima and I decided to go and it was pretty wonderful. It is honestly the most well organized collection of archaeological artifacts that I have seen in Peru. Plus its 5 or 10 soles per person!! would recommend",
          "Wonderful! We spent most of a day here in amazement of the relics and recreations of sites. Very nice!",
          "Well designed. Covers a broad range of cultures in Peru (although curiously misses Caral ). A very good combination of artifacts and explanatory material",
          "This museum gives you a good sense of the early history of Peru- the Precolombian civilizations which you can follow from the earliest until the Incas- which were the latest.",
          "If you love history, this is the place for you. Its location and size are incredible and it is very easy to get to from any area in Lima. Go there early as it closes at 4:00 pm on Fridays.",
          "This museum is a great one. Get a guide, they are very helpful and you will enjoy learning about the Inca and Pre Inca culture of Peru. Nice cafeteria, a little on the expensive side, but nice garden location.",
          "Only the site of Caral is absent from this excellent overview of Peru's cultures. Great collection of artifacts that reveal depths of information on each of Peru's ancient cultures.",
          "- Full of history museum. - Not a mandatory to visit if you have a limited time stay in Lima. - Not well organized.",
          "Not the most well laid out museum so it helps to take on some of the volunteer guides! Helps them practice English whilst you practice some Spanish!",
          "This museum is an excellent start to your Peruvian adventure and will help you understand the evolution of the many civilizations that led to the last, the Incas.",
          "The expositions are not so well made, but it is still interesting to see how Peruvians see their history. The pre-columbian part is nice.",
          "This is a pretty nice pre Inca museum. Housed in an older building with a simple layout with some very nice pieces of art and pottery. Some nice exhibits to help bring to life the idea of what it may have been like etc. 4 star activitie.",
          "Both museums are within a 15 minute or less walk from each other. People who are 60 years and over have a reduced admission of only 5 soles. About half of the exhibits are in English as well which was greatly appreciated. There are exhibits of Moche ceramics, Chimu gold which",
          "There was much to admire in this museum, but it is not as easy to follow or to interpret as the nearby Museo Larco. Some signage is also in English, but for the most part exhibits are in Spanish. The museum is divided into various periods/cultures in Peru's history, but",
          "The Museum displays a well curated, magnificent collection of art and objects covering all of the great Peruvian pre-colombian cultures and some elements of Peruvian history, in a pleasant setting with exposition rooms connected by open spaces. It is also not far from the",
          "It is the oldest Peruvian museum (and research center) with the largest collections of prehispanic artifacts. It is housed in two buildings resembling two adjacent cloisters sharing one side. One courtyard leads to rooms where the prehispanic collections are kept, including a",
          "We were brought here on our tour, so our guide gave us a good explanation of the myriad of ceramics, gold and silver artifacts, and textiles on display. It's surprising to see how many different ancient cultures arose in Peru. Without our guide, I don't think I would have",
          "The Museum explains the history of Peru starting with the Stone Age up to the 90s. The musuem givey an overview, but sometimes it's no explained very well, but it's still worth a visit.",
          "This is a very good museum, some areas better than the other, but in general visitors will see a lot of good artefacts and information, the sectors of ancient Peruvian history are particularly well done with good flow and information shared. Inside the museum, you can access a",
          "What a great museum. Whoever designed it did a great job. Amazing displays. Gorgeous grounds. Even a nice gift shop",
          "The museum itself is quite large and includes a LOT of artifacts, reconstructions of archaeological sites, reproductions of objects and images, costumes, textiles, etc. You can spend an entire day here, but you'd have to sort things out or visit with a guide. It was my second",
          "We went with a group and a local guide to this lovely museum. I would strongly suggest that you arrange a guide before going... The museum is small, with an amazing selection of beautiful and important artifacts representing the history and archeology of the Peruvian people's",
          "Very good museum, uncrowded and easy to access, although its in an unexpected place, I would recommend it before you go have a drink in the best watering hole in Pueblo Libre, Bar Antigua taberna Queirolo",
          "While many of the exhibits are older with Spanish-only labels, this museum has an excellent updated bilingual exhibit hall on the Nazca culture, particularly its textiles and mummies, which makes a visit well worth the admission. However, the Moche are nearly absent because they",
          "A little out of the way but worth the visit as it helps introduce you to Peru's history those of us from afar may not be familiar with. Affordable, 1-2 hours.",
          "This museum is located in a pleasant, quiet square in the Pueblo Libre district. It is a very pretty colonial style building and only 10 soles entrance. Comprises of about 20 rooms charting the history of Peru from prehistoric times up to colonial each covering different",
          "It is not a great museum, if you have to choose to visit just one or two in Lima, don't choose this one, is not worth it.",
          "It has an interesting collection of taxodermisted poieces as well as Peruvian Incan Culture pieces as well as colony and conquest legacy, from around 16th Century and from the 18th Century.Interesting cultural legacy.Visit Lima, City of Kings!",
          "Why is this place so empty? Its amazing, the treasures they have here. The building is nice, the pieces are well presented. We did have difficulty getting a snack as the cafe closed around 2pm and the vending machine failed us. But the staff were extremely helpful finding us",
          "I LOOOVE this museum. It's located in Pueblo Libre, a middle class part of Lima that isn't very touristy. The area is really safe and cute and clean. The museum itself is cheap to get into and heavily guarded, ensuring that the artifacts and the museum-goers are safe at all",
          "We had just a little over an hour here and the time went quickly because there is so much to see and take in. The visit really helped me to learn quite a bit about Peruvian and South American history and culture in a relatively short period of time. Would love to return, but",
          "Very informative museum with the information very nicely presented. Also admission was free and the museum was not very crowded. A very pleasant respite.",
          "Not only their collection is great but they also have a very nice restaurant where you can replenish your energy to be able to enjoy the full collection.",
          "This fairly small museum is an excellent first stop to familiarize yourself with Peruvian culture. If you can, take a tour, as it's hard to gleam the pertinent information on your own, as example the important collection of silver and gold. You'll pay 11.50 soles for entrance.",
          "Excellent tour guide...very knowable... I would recommend One if you are not familiar with the culture, history and art.",
          "We went here with a tour group and thought this little museum was outstanding. The pottery and figurine collections were great and the information was interesting. It included both Inka and pre-Inka civilizations. If you're into museums and anthropology, I'd highly recommend",
          "Good way to learn about the pre-Columbian period from 200BC to mid-16th century. A lot reading is required, with not interactive exhibits. Kids will be bored stiff. Iwas there with a group of college students and they were zoning out after the second exhibition hall. Only so",
          "We visited it as a complement to the Larco museum. It's smaller, we paid 3$ for the entry, and spent an hour there. Unfortunately most artifacts had explanations only in Spanish, others didn't have any. Some rooms were being redecorated or just opening.",
          "Nice museum, in a nice part of pueblo libre. The architecture is nice, colonial, the place is very calm, the museum contains good historical content",
          "A truly impressive presentation of pre-Columbian cultures in Peru. Between the National Museum and the Larco\u2014a full day's commitment\u2014one receives an excellent introduction to pre-Conquest P\u00e9ru. Brilliant curation.",
          "It's definitely good to know a thing or two about civilizations that thrived before the Inca empire. This museum talks about people and their lives. The displays are simple but very informative. Budget at least an hour for this place.",
          "As other travelers have already noted, this museum is located in a historic building associated with Simon Bolivar and nicely complements the Larco museum nearby. I suggest spending two or three hours here for an overview of Peru's rich and varied past. The regional variations,",
          "Very good exposition, organized by cultures. Excellent archaeological findings including ceramics, tapestry and gold. Every room has comparative time lines. The Must for understanding Peru's ancient history. Pity not all the exhibits has English explanations. The building",
          "This adds more detail to the history lesson started at museo larco. The initial displays in the courtyard don't have English translations. However the main areas do so don't despair and give up. What this museum contains which complements Larco is a section of the colonial",
          "Does not have the same quality of artifacts as the Larco but has a better layout of Peru's History and a much broader range of artifacts-which are quite good. When you see this with the Larco, you are MUCH better prepared to visit the Inca and Pre-Inca sites. This museum ties",
          "This is a museum that will help you understand the history of the area from pre-Inca, Inca, which only lasted a short period, through the Colonial Era.",
          "This is a very well done museum about the history of Peru. Some of its exhibits are truly unique perspectives on Peruvian history. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This museum is a must for every traveler to Lima. The oldest in Lima offering a complete history of Peru thru all the pieces of art on display. Incredible!!! Be sure to hire a guide at the museum, Actually, your trip to Peru should start at this museum,",
          "This museum provides a summary of the history of Peru. While one does walk away with a near complete picture temporally, one can't help to be aware of the gaps in and vagueness of the descriptions of certain periods, particularly those more modern. One can clearly understand",
          "Amazing museum close to the Larco Museum and the Bolivar house. It holds artifacts from all the pre-columbian civilizations of Peru including the pornographic pottery. Great place to learn about these civilizations.",
          "The National Museum has an astonishing and well organized collection of Peruvian antiquities. The musuem is well organized and many of the exhibits seem to have been recently updatede.",
          "Most people might overlook this truly informative and attractively laid out museum that tracks the history of the various people of the country over 5000 years, because it is out of the center of downtown Lima, in Pueblo LIbre. However it is easily accessible by the",
          "The museum was interesting and had a great collection but the lack in display quality took away from the experience. The glass of the displays were usually dirty and hard to see through. Most of the interactive displays were quite old and didn't work anymore. The staff was",
          "If you want to get deeper than Inka culture into Peru's history this is a must. On top you experience a beautiful quarter.",
          "Not many people allot enough time in Lima to see the attractions on their way to Cuzco or Machu Picchu. This is a small but very important museum of artifacts from Peru that highlight the Moche people and their pottery. It's amazing the number of masks that were created and",
          "Really liked this museum. Especially the way they tried to explain things with models and maquetes. A disadvantage however is that all written explination is in Spanish.. Another nice museum nearby is Museo Larco. You can easily visit both places in one day: it's about 20",
          "A small museum that provides a concise and intelligent introduction to the varied streams of Peruvian history up to and including the Inca conquests. I was fascinated by the burial rites and ceremonies - seemed somewhat Egyptian with treasures and guards and family members",
          "These museum had a lot of interesting displays. It was a bigger museum than Museo Larco and much cheaper. I would definitely come take a look. The area around the museum is also nice. There are some good restaurants and a beautiful park right in front of the entrance.",
          "Really great museum of the rich culture in Peru. A room, different big in size, for each culture and good signs in both English and Spanish. If you like museums it's a must visit, but make sure you have enough time to appreciate it all. A little hard to get to, ask at your",
          "You can learn about many pre-Hispanic cultures through the artifacts on view here. Allow hours for your visit.",
          "The quality of exhibits and display is sorely in need of funding. Larco Museum is much better and a short walk away.",
          "We found the historical features of this museum to be very interesting and there is a nice garden area in the central courtyard to relax in. The gold room is also very interesting.",
          "We enjoyed it tremendously as the museum is so full of artifacts and excellent displays of the many different ancient cultures. The pottery and metal rooms are amazing and shows what an advanced group of people with highly developed skills. The textile displays also confirm",
          "Let's learn more about this magnificent culture by seeing the rest of peruvian handmade that talks about their social organization, their religion, their population. This is one of the most important museums that you can visit and where you can find good services and good prices.",
          "We visited on our Lima Tour with a guided tour provided by the bus tour guide. It is located across from Bolivar Square in a reasonable area of Lima. On entering the museum, you first see the well maintained lawn that the museum buildings are constructed around. The first",
          "Visited as first stop on 12 day Road Scholar \"Ancient Civilizations of Peru\". It was a perfect introduction to the rest of our visit. We got an over view of the early history and culture in Peru. The pottery was very well displayed.",
          "We had an English speaking tour guide who really gave us the basis of understanding early Peru culture and religion. We. Visited this museam first before the Larco. On the map they look close to each other, but really it was probably a mile walk in between",
          "Spectacular collection of Peruvian artefacts, explaining a lot of its history. Especially the renewed part exhibiting the Paracas culture is wonderfull.",
          "Great museum, but would not recommend a guided tour. Our guide did not speak enough English to make us understand him... The signs are in English though so with hind sight no guide needed.",
          "I visited this museum in the afternoon to see magnificent collections of Chavin, Nasca, Mochica and Chimu potteries, fabrics, well preserved mummies thought to be 2,500 years old, and sculptures of different Inca sites. This museum is closed on Mondays. I suggest you have a",
          "If you love visiting museums, you'll love the National Museum of Archaeology. It is filled with a rich diversity of Peru's culture. You'll learn not just about the Inca but the other Peruvian cultures as well. Peru is rich in its cultural history.",
          "This Museum is very well organized for a cotextual understanding of precolumbian art in the framework of the history and the cultures of this country. Some of the very best pieces of art of many periodas and cultures of ancient Peru.",
          "Having just finished my archaeology degree last year, this was a must-see for me and it did not disappoint. Allow a few hours to fully enjoy and absorb all the museum has on view. Nicely updated areas make it a pleasure to visit.",
          "This is a place you must visit if you want to know better and understand the pre-hispanic cultures and their evolution. The guide was afforable (15 soles) and very kind and communicative. I expected thoug a little more pieces from the spanish era, there are a lot (really, a lot)",
          "I was with a my (OAT) group(we had local guide). However a guide is not needed. It is 10 soles( about 3 soles to the $) and 15 soles if you want a guide. The displays are in English as well as Spanish. I liked that the exhibits were Pre-Inca. Here you can see pieces from the",
          "Very well organized and educacional museum. Lots of childrens groups visiting as well. Interesting and fun",

          "Hey, no messing around, if you want to spend a few hours with a guide (extra cost), this is the place. We had an excellent English speaking guide named Marco and he took us through the fascinating history of the various indigenous peoples one by one. The artifacts are countless,",

          "I've been going here for a decade now and it's a damned sight better than it was, believe me. There are new exhibitions about the Paracas culture and other sections of Peruvian prehistory (Formative and early periods) that are very welcome. Yet at the same time it's still a bit",
          "We had an excellent English speaking guide who took us through the history and anthropology of Peru. It pulled together so much of what we'd seen in Cusco and Machu Picchu the previous week. Well worth the 90 minutes and fun to see the former home of Simon Bolivar.",

Its central monument gives homage to Peru's liberator, Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precedents ===\nThe location of the plaza had been the site of the San Juan de Dios hospital which was torn down in 1850 and replaced by a railway station, which in turn was torn down between 1911 and 1918.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe Plaza San Mart\u00edn was inaugurated on July 27, 1921 in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the independence of Peru. The design, ornamentation, furnishing, and gardening of the plaza was designed by Manuel Piqueras Cotol\u00ed. The benches and handrails were constructed out of marble and the paving, of granite. There were also four water fountains, bronze streetlamps, and flower-filled gardens. The design for the monument to Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn was chosen in a contest in which the design created by the Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure emerged victorious and illustrated San Martin during his voyage across the Andes.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe construction of the buildings that surrounded the plaza occurred at a gradual pace. The Col\u00f3n Theater and the Giacoletti buildings were the first structures to be built and were erected in 1914 before the construction of the plaza. The other buildings were later built in three stages. The Hotel Bolivar was built in 1924 and was designed by Rafael Marquina. The Zela and Pumacahua arcades were built during the second stage in 1926 and also were designed by Rafael Marquina. The Club Nacional was built in 1929 by Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski and Enrique Bianchi. In the third and final stage of the project from 1935-1945 the remaining flanks of the plaza were built up with the construction of the Cine Metro, F\u00e9nix, Boza, and Sudam\u00e9rica buildings which were built in the Neocolonial style (similar to the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture).\nAs a result, the plaza maintains uniformity with respect to its buildings' facades. Its overall appearance is primarily baroque; the buildings, plaza, and central monument all cohere to uniform and specific styles. The architectural style to which most of the surrounding buildings belong to is that of the neohispanic or neocolonial styles within the realm of European derived architecture.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPlaza Bolivar (Lima)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Lima) at Wikimedia Commons",

          "lights and shadows flow you through a path of waterways with secluded nooks to savor the atmosphere. Incredible shows projected on walls of water here, tunnels of water to walk through there. The climate is so dry that even if you get wet you'll be back to normal in minutes.",
          "This was my Gala night experience in lima. A great wrap-up to my week there. The engineering to create these illuminations is mind-boggling! It seems everyone is here and the excitement is infectious! With all the people attending and the food vendors, it is like a big community",

          "You do need your walking shoes for this one but it is worth it. Try to get there just before the sunset so you can admire the view of the park and then at night the lights. I went with my mother and we did walk quite a bit. We did not mind as it was so beautiful. It is so cool",
          "If you do not have much time to spend in Lima, please do not go there. Ok there are many fountains but this is not a must visit. It has a ticket which is very cheap. If you have time to kill or you have a kid go for a walk.",
          "The attraction is fun and pretty but watch out for thieves and pickpockets there. They work in groups and target tourists. One person in our group had her wallet stolen from her purse. For an attraction that requires an admissions ticket, the Peruvians did a poor job of",
          "Working at Walt Disney World, I feel I know a little something about shows and presentations of this nature as WDW has one or two similar ones to this in terms of the technology. I'd say outside of WDW this is the best show I have seen of this nature. It is important to",
          "this place is very nice to walk alone, with friends or family, the circuit of the waters is very synchronized and spectacular, at night you can look much better by the game of lights and sounds, I really recommend them very funny",

          "Water show was very nice! After the show we walked around the park and enjoyed the different fountains and the ambiance.",

          "Lots of locals here enjoying the many lit up fountains and the light show. Can't beat the price -- only 4 soles. The light show takes place every 45 minutes beginning at 7:15pm, lasting for 15 minutes. Not quite as elaborate as Disney, but fun, nevertheless. Well worth the price",
          "Disney could learn a trick or two from them. The park is in two parts connected by an underground tunnel full of pictures from around Lima. There were many fountains all lit up including a tunnel of water to walk through. They had a projection show at the main fountain that was",

          "This is a must if you visit Lima. Go early enough to bring a picnic supper - the park is beautiful. Visit all 9 fountains before nightfall when the light show begins. But get to the show early enough to be in a front row. Sometimes hard to see the whole lighting effect on",

          "Definitely worth seeing if you have kids who will enjoy it. There is not a lot to see outdoors in Lima at night but this is one of the highlights. Be wary of the surrounding area and come and go in transport.",

          "This is a beautiful place. I'd never seen a water park before, and thought it was great, walking around and seeing the incredible things they do with water and a few pumps. Also the only place I've ever been where a girl came out of nowhere and grabbed me you-know-where.",
          "it is highly recommendable to visit it. for Peru, it is one of the most important shows in the country. it is not compared to Disney, but it is worth it",

          "It was such magical night to see the show in the water with colors, music and the history of music in peru. After that we walked through the circuit and finished eating anticuchos next door, next to the Stadium. Take a warm coat now.",
          "Very good, better in summer, because there is a high probability of getting wet there. And also better at night to aprecciate the lights in water show",
          "I strongly recommend this lovely experience to all kinds of tourists, families, couples, oldies (like myself), youngsters, backackers, hipsters, millenials, everybody! If you go during the winter, bring warm clothes. Won't say more... don't want to spoil the magic!",
          "I did not think that I would like this as much as I did. The light show is truly amazing. Much different than the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas. Much better in my opinion.",
          "Do not miss this when in Lima .... it's fabulous !!! It is a feast for the senses & eyes ... great family attraction.",
          "The water fountain show is very interesting to see by itself, but a lot of other 'things' around it that are done poorly make the experience worse. The water/light show is well done and fun to see - just be sure you line up against the barricades at least 15 minutes early to get",
          "I only spent an hour or an hour and a half, but I really enjoyed it. Watching the water patterns change, the colours change, and listening to the music was just really nice. Local buses run along this road, and take you back into the main part of Miraflores - very handy if your",
          "We had a nice time here. If you have children this is absolutely a spot you should take them. He park is very safe and the fountains are beautiful. The laser and music show on fountain 2 is much fun. It begins at 7:15, 8:15. There are other fountains you can walk through etc.",
          "very nice place to chill out an evening, next door to a stadium. some tour operator combine it with a museum, but can be done independently.",

          "A dozen large illuminated fountains , 1 of which you can walk under and 1 you can walk into ( with proper timing ) without getting soaked. In a beautiful park, great for families and couples. Costs only 5 soles ( US $1.50). Hourly light show at the huge- 400 foot long fountain.",
          "I really enjoyed the fountains at this park. It was a very pleasant 2+ hours. The light show that played was impressive. It is a must-see in Lima",
          "We stayed for two main shows and walked throughout the park to all the water displays. I enjoyed the fountain that allows people to cross into the middle while trying not to get soaked. It was a little cold so we decided against it, but enjoyed laughing with the people who",
          "Lima is a place where you can visit in a day and fly to another destination. But if you're stuck here for 3 days then I would definitely recommend this place. You should only visit this place at night because that is were all the magic happens. They have over 15 water",
          "The light show is outstanding. I saw a plate: biggest public waterpark according to Guiness Records.",
          "Impressive show of colors over water, this is something that a traveler should not miss, the park is open all day however the first show is at sunset when is dark ( 8 pm ) and last about 30 minutes over a cascade of water and music surrounding this site , it will leave you",

          "Makes a good evening out and you don't have to do it as a group tour as can get a taxi there. Good for all ages with different fountains in park lit up in evening. Entry includes short show with images on the colourful water. There are reductions for any older travellers so ask.",

          "Circuito Magico Del Agua :- What a great venue and water show. The fountains are beautiful, one is designed for kids to get wet by running in & out of the water spurts and the light show is wonderful to watch. A great evening for everyone.",
          "The magic fountain show was truly amazing in terms of technical execution and creativity. Really highlights the best of Peru!",

          "The magic show runs thrice from Tuesday to Sunday. They show Peru's tourist places and it's cool! I stayed one extra night just to visit it and i don't regret it at all! Just in case, if you have seen 'Songs of the Sea' in Singapore's Sentosa island, its something similar.",
          "The park was perfect. Various dancing and color changing fountains to stop and admire. The most popular one was the tunnel where you walk under a tunnel of water shooting out in a perfect arch, without getting wet, unless someone touches it and splashes. Very clean and",
          "I\u00b4m really impressed what can be done with lights, water and sound. The most incredible thing I saw was Jaguar walking on the water. Amazing !",

          "I wouldn't recommend paying any company to take you here, it is easily accessible on your on and significantly cheaper. It was nice to walk around and see the lights but nothing I would go out of my way to go to but had a nice time and we didn't have any other plans that night.",

          "When the Limenas are free they like to visit their parcs. That is admirable, but it becomes a massive visit. The Magic circuit of fountains has a nice big show, and is relatively nice and big, but becomes crowdy on days when the people also have a day off",
          "Really a wonderful place, this park of the waters. I would recommend it for all ages. There is fun to have for those who would like to get wet and for those whom would not. There is the laser light show, which really will remind you of early music videos but is attempting",

          "We went there yesterday, probably the busiest day of all with four kids and still space enough to walk around and try all the water and jumping castle attractions. Entry is cheap S/.4 per person, kids till 4 are free and elderly above 65 also. One can buy snacks in the park as",

          "Entire place of Magic Fountains is a beautiful at night. Senior Citizens get big discount in Entry Fee. However, Musical / Dancing part is not all that great as described in publicity materials. There are better Music coordinated water shows in Singapore's Sentossa and Dubai's",

          "This much hyped tourist attraction was frankly disappointing. Anyone who has seen the fountains in Barcelona will be distinctly underwhelmed by this site. You can't hear the music that is supposed to be playing.",
          "Went to the Parque de Aguas with my class after school. This is a place to visit as it gets dark, not during the day I think. Lovely park and oh the fountains! Truly fantastic. Each one along the circuit has a different theme. So interesting and the ever changing colors were",
          "This place was absolutely beautiful! The landscaping is immaculate and the many fountains in the park were great! The highlight of course is watching the light/water show. The first one starts at 7:15 p.m. It's a must see. We visited the month of October 2016 and for me it",

          "If you like some water shows and beautiful fountains this place is a must go. It's actually pretty easy to get there with the bus \"metropolitano\" as it's right next to the station. Also the entrance is really cheap, there are some tours as well. The park itself has its charm and",
          "This is a gated park, well maintained and free of street vendors -- with the exception of a line of cute little food carts near the main attraction. It has many beautiful fountains and is nice to wander around in. They do a water show where a long stretch of fountains are timed",

          "Takes 30 - 40 min from town and costs 25 sol. Entry very cheap and you need to take your time and enjoy. You can get wet if you participate in the water display action. There are changing rooms if needed. Good eateries outside that we enjoyed a great meal.",
          "I really like the park in general. The show after dark, really is neat. But there is no place to sit and the crowds push in a lot. I would recommend doing it once.",

          "You have to pay to use the bathrooms, you can't sit on the grass.",
          "Magic, I suggest to wear jacket and warm clothes because the weather is cold and is possible to get wet, guide avaliable",
          "Awesome. The lights and music are stunning.",
          "It's a beautiful water show. But if you pay a ticket to get in, the bathroom should be free, not paid.",
          "Good place to visit and see the fountains lit up at night",
          "Un show muy hermoso.\nA beautiful park, beautiful water show, and some water activities.",
          "Pet friendly, 5am a 11am",
          "Beautiful park, very nice place to stay in the evening",
          "I love this place, this nice to do while you are in Lima Peru",
          "A nice place both for adults and kids. You will have the best experience after 19:00.",
          "Lots to do for a small entry fee, good food plenty of walking. Great family time would love to do it again",
          "The multimedia light show starts at 7:15pm and was amazing. There is some entertainment for kids like fountains to play with the water and a little train. Also there are local food (like anticuchos or picarones) and chicha morada for sale. I went by myself but saw some tourist group with a guide.",
          "Great place to walk around and get some great pictures. I recommend getting to this place on your own unless you absolutely need to have a tour guide. Entry fee is only 4 soles ($1.33 roughly) so those costly tours are not worth it, all I \u2026",
          "Wonderfull",
          "Nice place for family time. Beautiful fountains. Extremely busy place.",
          "A delightful jewel of a find in Lima.",
          "It is worthwhile going there! I have seen big fountains in a few places.",
          "Great place for family visits.  Not just fountains but a light show through the mist with lasers during the the evening shows",
          "Beautiful and fun to see, you should visit if you have time in Lima, but you only need an hour or two. Come during the night when there are shows.",
          "Too much people and they are money hungry  the 4 soles you pay only gives you the right to go in the park, you have to pay for everything inside and if u need to go outside for any reason you have to pay again to re enter. And there is nothing to do inside but walk.",
          "So beautiful and romantic at night. Only 4 soles to enter. They have a show at 7pm",
          "Great show, full of fun with lights, music and lot of water... Highly recommended to visit with family, kids or group of friends, you will enjoy it.. There are hotspots for great pictures.. You can also try many different kind of peruvian \u2026",
          "It's simply breathtaking",
          "Nice place for evening with family or friends.",
          "Really cool show. Totally worth it. Cute stands with good donuts and popcorn. Perfect for the show",
          "Great Photo opportunity and very colorful",
          "Very very beautiful!",
          "This is great, go during the day. At night there are too many people.",
          "What a lovely little place in Lima. We went just after Dark and it was magical. Lots of families and a lovely atmosphere. Great value for money and a fun experience. There was a live show at 1930 and that was worth seeing.",
          "Great way to pass a night in Lima, the entrance is very cheap and all the fountains give you something different to watch, the light show is about 18 min long and it's worth the wait.",
          "Nice but short, just 15 minutes",
          "Great light show! Look at their website for timings but best to go in the night.",
          "Amazing place  soo much fun",
          "Beautiful water features - lots of colours. Shows every half hour I think right up until 9:30-10pm. took an Uber both ways.. was safe at night time.",
          "Really polished and stunning attraction, plenty of helpful staff, beautifully kept grounds and thoroughly enjoyable water features. Easily overlooked, this is a fantastic night activity in the city of Lima not to be missed. Located conveniently nextdoor to the stadium and its adjoining bus station.",
          "Very colorful and bigger than I expected",
          "If you have children under the age of 10 I would have no hesitation to recommend this light show.  Otherwise, I would describe it as a Disney type experience without the rides.  Maybe worth visiting just to tick the box.",
          "I thought it was called Parque de Fountaine. \n\nAnyway, had a great time. Park was full of Chollos and Hoochie Mamas that couldn't stay of the grass. \n\nThe lights and fountains are amazing but felt like I had to keep my hands on my wallet.\n\nFood service there sucked.",
          "Truly wonderful visit  the water park when in Lima",
          "Beyond super. Must visit while in Lima.",
          "A colourful, magical place for all ages! Feels like Disney World.",
          "Amazing park. Nice place to spend time with the family.",
          "This is a really fun place to visit with many fountains - never walked through a tunnel fountain before and the local Lima kids really seem to enjoy the water",
          "Need to stand on the right side of the light show or else u cant see anything. All the other water features are pretty cool - especially the water tunnel.",
          "Really cool fountains and light shows. The laser show is definitely worth checking out, but you can run in and out of some of the water fountain displays; the layout of the park is really cool so it's great just to walk around while you eat some churros. The photos really don't do it justice.",
          "Wonderful experience for the entire family. Nicer than when it first opened. Well maintained and with clear signs along the way. A must seen if you are in Lima.",
          "Beautiful park.\nWater and light shoe spectacular!",
          "Really well choreographed show complete with video and sound\n\nReally fun and well priced (4 sols per person)",
          "Cost 4 sol per person. Good to see at night. There were 13 fountain areas and lit up at night. Catch the show that is given at set times.",
          "Unique inexpensive water fountain park. They did water fountains colored with lights in some creative ways. Well worth the effort to go and see.",
          "My favorite place",
          "Had a really lovely evening  walking around,  you don't need ages  there  but there is enough  to keep you entertained.  Go at night though it looks incredible.",
          "Great place!",
          "Fun park of fountains.",
          "Such a great spot for an evening stroll. Best 4 soles I've ever spent.",
          "Fun fountains to view. The show is nice as well. Limited food options inside, though greater selection just outside the main entrance. For 4 soles, it's worth a few hours.",
          "Highly recommend a visit here, especially at dark to catch the light show. It's 10min and happens every hour starting roughly at 7, 8 and 9. They use a projector to show animated scenes and peruvian culture in the water.\n\nEven if you aren't \u2026",
          "Was a neat park that is great for kids and family. Water show is fun and also has audio-visuals, not just water tricks, etc.",
          "Ok",
          "Lovely evening entertainment , even on a budget. Great with older people as well as kids",
          "Nice light and laser show combined with water fountains, highly recommend!",
          "It's a nice park with a decent amount of water fountains that's different from each other. There are water shows 3 times a night. I believe 7:15, 8:15 and 9:15. It cost 4sol to go in.",
          "Place to visit in family, there are water show every each hour, there are stores to buy dessert and some fast food. take some extra clothes if you are gonna be inside some fountains :)",
          "This was a great experience. And very cheap (4 sols each)",
          "Ok",
          "Actually really big and fun. There's an entrance fee \u2013 I don't remember exactly how much but it was pretty affordable.",
          "Cheap but a lot of fun",
          "Beautiful park, very lush grass and gardens, all of the fountains are nice and interesting",
          "It was nice to be in that place and I really recommend to other people.",
          "Bellisimo",
          "Fabulous time spent wandering around the fountains late afternoon turning into evening when the lights came on",
          "An excellent show! It was a beautiful performance where water is the main character. You have to go at night to see it.",
          "Bellisimo",
          "Beautiful dancing water display lights, projections and laser show at night a garden display during the day.",
          "There were 3 shows throughout the evening at 7:15,8:15, and 9:15. The park is big. There are another side of the park across the tunnel.",
          "A must see in Lima. Simply wonderful and not expensive. The lights and laser show at night on one of the main water fountain is worth the few soles required.",
          "When you are in Lima, you have to go there, it's amazing",
          "Nice, calm and amazing photos to take :)",
          "Really beatiful...!",

          "It's the most beautiful show in Lima.",
          "It worst the look at night to admire the fountains with color and music and most of all the 15 min show which is really impressive! But at day, and in August it's not the best moment",
          "lots if fun for the family beautiful place for a walk",
          "Totally worth the travel and enjoy that 10mins water fountain show! Smart way to broadcast culture and we took tons of pics.",
          "Ok",
          "Excellent and magical.!!!",
          "Perfect for families! For 4 soles really nice show!",
          "It is really nice and the park is beautiful... But from my humble point of view, I think Lima and the country may use the money spent on this show for helping depressed areas and specially in programs about waste disposal and recycling",
          "Pleasant, nice filler, not spectacular.",
          "Super chebre",
          "you can go anytime but there's a scheduled musical/light show performance at the main fountain. bring a tripod so you can do long exposure photos of the water fountains.",

        "wiki": "The Archbishop's Palace of Lima, the capital of Peru, is the residence of the Archbishop of Lima, and the administrative headquarters of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lima. It is located on the Plaza Mayor of Lima, in the Historic Centre of Lima.\nThe palace is also headquarters to the offices of the cardinal of Peru who is Carlos Castillo Mattasoglio, who is also the archbishop of Lima.\n\n\n== History ==\nLocated on the land that Francisco Pizarro allocated to be the residence of the head priest of Lima after the foundation of the city in 1535, the current building was opened on December 8, 1924 and is considered a prime example of neo-colonial architectural that developed in Lima during the early twentieth century.The old Archbishop's Palace was built on the place the Limean cabildo had occupied from 1535 to 1548, when that institution moved to its current location across the square. The building had six balconies of different styles and several entrances, displaying the Archdiocese coat of arms above the main gate. The architectural features of the courtyard were similar to those of several cloisters in the city. The old palace fa\u00e7ade was demolished in the late 19th century along the Sagrario. The remaining structure was demolished prior to the construction of the present Archbishop's palace.\nThe current building was designed by the Polish Peruvian architect Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski, who used the Torre Tagle Palace as a reference point.  Erected joined to the Cathedral of Lima, the location formerly belonged to the city's first police station and the city's first jail. After Pope Paul III designated this temple as the primary church headquarters of the city, the location became the current location of the Archdiocese.\nThe facade is made up of baroque elements, completely made of reintegrated rock; ornate cedar balconies are located over the main doors, and the palace is finished by a granite sculpture of Saint Turibius of Mongrovejo the patron protector of the Archdiocese. The palace also consists of two flagpoles, one for the Peruvian flag and another for flag of the Vatican. The interior is completely ornated and is home to a sculpture of Santa Barbara the patron of Cuba. The ceiling is illuminated by famous French stained glass windows allowing the entry of light. The interior also contains marble staircases with wooden handrails which allow access to the second story.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBalconies of Lima\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "Wonderful huacas here in the middle of Lima. You can walk in the Huaca San Miguel; the others can not be entered but you can still have a good image of them. There is also an old wall. The parque also contains a zoo and some wonderful playgrounds",
          "I went to the Zoo at least twice a year. Even though it covers a large area, they amount of animals on display are limited. However, you will find still a wide range of animals from all over the world. Make sure to bring sunscreen and water. Leaving the zoo leads to a street",
          "Too many zoos try to have large collections that represent a full Noah's ark of world wildlife; the only elephant on display here was a full sized skeleton in a nice case along one of the walkways. Instead, the focus at this zoo is on the important regional wildlife, organized",
          "While in Peru, I visited Parque de las Leyendas. The zoo seemed to be und r r construction and there were very few animals. I would say there were a total of 8 animals to view and two of the animals available were native to Peru. The hairless dogs and Llama's were the main",
          "Decided to visit the Zoo here in Lima on my last day, as I didn't have much to do. Man was I glad I made the trip here. There were numerous exotic animals such as jaguars, condors, tapirs, llamas and alpacas! Worth visiting and maybe spending more time in the warmer months.",
          "Divided in the different zones of Peru, the zoo its a good way for kids to learn about the varieties of their country. And lets face it - animals are always fun ;) Migth not what you do with your friends, but definitely a good way to spend a day with the kids ;)",
          "This is a big park, what is interesting is that they made a zoo within a waca (Inca Ruins) originally a ceremonial and adminsitrative site. The zoo is divided by Peruvian different regions (costa, selva, etc). The Selva region is very good. Althoug is and old zoo configuration",
          "We visited on a Saturday and it was busy at 10am. However the queues to enter were even longer at 1pm when we left so either visit on a weekday or come early. Firstly, the good: the entry is cheap and there are a lot of things to see once inside. However, some of the enclosures",
          "It is a large zoo integrated with local history. It was quite beautiful. I enjoyed the many animal exhibits and the beautiful scenery. The zoo was in the process of updating the facilities, however we were still able to fully enjoy the entire park. Take your time to stroll the",
          "It is well laid out and we liked how it had sections themed for different regions. We went midday during off-season, so there was construction and some animals were gone. We still really enjoyed it! If you're traveling with children or an animal lover, it is worth going to,",
          "I love going to zoos when I travel. I like seeing the different designs and seeing what different things the different zoos have to offer. While I enjoyed our 3 hours at Parque de las Leyendas I would not say that it is one of the best, nor the worst. Admission to the zoo is",
          "I will start off by saying my family got there late in the afternoon.... maybe at 3? The park wasn't crowded and I think going so late had to do with that. It was also a bit chilly out so that could have played a factor. I liked that it wasn't too crowded. I really enjoyed the",
          "I won't say a lot because other reviews have pretty well covered things as far as I'm concerned. I visited with my wife and 2 year old daughter. Our daughter had a great time. She has been wanting to see penguins since one of her books has penguins who live in Peru. We will get",
          "The park is beautifully designed and well kept. Of course one can discuss if animals belong in cages, but the park is a joy to walk through. The jungle area and the botanical garden are marvelous. Some/many cages are definitely too small. The animals look well fed and generally",
          "I was kind of disappointed about the installations, also there is not much variety of animals. I know in Peru there is a lot of species but we can not see them all in here. There is much to improve definitely.",
          "Is a shame that with so much fauna Peru didn't do a better job with their exhibits. They don't use the same acrylic enclosure some places use here in the US, but instead some reflecting material that not only prevents you to seeing the fauna, take good pictures but on top they",
          "With an entrance price of just S/. 10, this zoo is a steal! The zoo is separated into zones: jungle, coast, lagoon, sierra, and international. Because the park is so big, you'll find yourself walking a lot to get from zone to zone; but in between zones, you can admire the",
          "Altho this park is listed as a Zoo, it is much more than that. The variety of animals from around the world is extensive. One walks thru the various regions of the country - I especially enjoyed the Selva and the boat ride on the Laguna. The park is large but one can find",
          "it is really fun walking around this gigantic park, I actually got lost several times and not having any idea where I was, I simply continued along, eventually it made sense. you get to get a feel for a few of Perus different climates as they themed different areas for both the",
          "Visited the zoo on a Wednesday morning. Lots and lots (and lots) of little kids. But it was still a fun time! Great variety of animals. They appeared to be well cared for. The zoo is laid out well. I loved the Zona Selva (the forest zone). Adult admission was only S/.10, which",
          "We visited the zoo in a recent visit to Peru. I would recommend getting here very early. We were visiting during summer break so a lot of field trips were taking place. We made sure to arrive when the zoo was opening at 9:00. It is deceivingly large in terms of area. There",
          "I came here a little while back and I'm passionate about animals so love going to any kind of zoo. What I really love about Parque de las Leyendas is seeing how good the staff there are, they all clearly love their jobs and really care for each and every animal in their zoo -to",
          "I had high hopes for the zoo, and while it wasn't as amazing as I pictured, it still was a very enjoyable day, and I learned a lot about Peruvian animals! The price is good (10 soles), especially since you will spend anywhere from 2 - 5 hours in the park. The zoo has animals",
          "I took my two year daughter last Sunday and we made sure to arrive early (10 am) to enjoy the morning before the crowds. There are two zoos in the Lima area, this and another heading out towards Chosica. I asked my Peruvian friends and this is the traditional (50 year old) zoo",
          "We went on a Monday afternoon and may have been the only people in the park. Admission is only 10 soles and you get to see beautiful exotic animals (so many monkeys and birds that I had never seen before in an American zoo). The rainforest section is especially beautiful as it's",
          "My first word of advice: DON'T GO ON A WEEKEND!!! Although a big place, there were long queues of people pushing and shoving to get in. There must have been thousands entering and I'm not exaggerating. It was very much a family day out on the Sunday we went. Most people had come",
          "Keep in mind this is Peru, so if you manage expectations - you're not going to find San Diego Zoo here; this can be a very fun day. Zoo is set in a historical Huaca, so you get Archeology as well as animals. The native animal areas are divided by geographic regions of Peru and",
          "This zoo is amazing.. very well done. It is constructed around some ancient Inca ruins that are continuously being excavated.. It also surprised me that seniors are free.. It is clean, well landscaped.. the animals look healthy and happy and active. We all were very pleased!!",
          "My wife and I just wanted to see Capybaras, a native Peruvian animal. After wandering around this zoo for quite a while, it was apparent that it was kind of run-down. Plus, there were exhibits from Oil and Mining companies! Pretty much the opposite of what a zoo should be",
          "For a new family moving to Lima this is really a good place to go. Not only does it offer a variety of animals but also play areas for the kids as well as educational tours. From going on foot through parts of the park to a carridge ride. I have visited this place 4 times since",
          "It is not a typical zoo as I am used to but then again this is Peru. I enjoyed my time here and saw some animals that I never saw before. The kids place is nice but a bit old. The zoo itself has very. Modern things and well maintained but also some very old stuff and not",
          "Although some parts are currently undergoing renovations, it is still a great place to see endemic species of animals you were not able to see in Peru.",
          "This is a attraction made for locals and just for this fact worth a look. The park las Leyendas is a mixture of zoo, bothanical park and ancient peruvian ruins, located 25 minutes from Miraflores district. There are a newer instalations like the \"felinario\" and older ones",
          "It's a nice zoo. Worth the price for sure. Also there is a large Incan ruin that you can see and a small history museum that is nice.",
          "It's a local zoo with a good selection of animals. It's not world class, but it's cheap, very clean and the landscaping is lovely.",
          "I'd give this zoo 5 stars except it was still being renovated when I visited. That being said this is one of the better zoos I've been to. What I especially like about it is that in addition to the typical big African game most zoos have this one also has animals you'll only",
          "This zoo attracts mostly local (Peruvian) tourism. The animals are keeps is small cages and look slightly sickly. I think there are a lot of much better places to see in Lima.",
          "Some people might think that all big-city zoos are alike. And at first glance, walking into the Parque de las Leyendas zoo felt a lot like walking into the a zoo in San Diego, Denver, or Miami. But that feeling would soon change. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I didn\u2019t come to Peru to",

          "Its not a 'world class' zoo. However, it is clean, attractive, and placed right in the middle of impressive ruins. More importantly, it featured most of the significant native wildlife including jaguar, condor, panthers, etc. Enclosures were on par with an average mid-sized",
          "The variety of animals at this zoo is fantastic. Puma's and bears, rhino's and hippos. Being from NZ, its unlike you get to see these sorts of animals, even during the hike on the inca trail. Great way to waste a spare day, waiting for a flight. The zoo is quite confusing, lots",

          "The parque is not really geared towards tourists. It is a local attraction with some small spaces for some tatty and sad looking animals. Yet another case of a zoo that does not look after its animals properly. The botanical garden is basically a collection of evergreen",
          "This is like a government owned park. Meaning it is cheap. But it is quite nice. A lot of different animals. Just remember to NOT go in the weekends, or on vacation days. Too many people (because of the price).",
          "This a large zoo with lots to see so make you sure have enough time. In summer it gets very hot so I would advise an early start. Although we went in the middle of the summer holidays the park wasn't overcrowded and although there were lots of children they were very well",
          "Place is one of the biggest in the country. It provides a fine view of the Coast, The Mountains and the Jungle; all of it in one single \"Park.\" Park has been in the area for many years. Through the years, the park has been upgraded. A lot of things were added. Parking is a bit",
          "Especially nice if you go with kids. There is a playground, a maze, that my grandson loved. As zoo, I am always sorry to see animals in cages. It is well done showing the three regions of Peru... the coast, the sierra and the jungle",
          "Just a poor mans Zoo which shows local and foreign animals in a big park.",
          "My Zoo experiences are pretty limited, San Diego Zoo, San Francisco Zoo, DC Zoo. The positive here is that they have some Amazonian/Andean creatures you are unlikely to see anywhere else (Amazonian tapir? You gotta be kidding me) The downside is that the heat can make this",
          "We had a great time at Parque de las Leyendas. While the surrounding area doesn't seem all that nice, it's easy to get a taxi to and from the front entrance. We paid S/.20 to and from Miraflores, but I wouldn't be surprised if a good negotiator could get there for less. It's",
          "I have been to a lot of zoo's all over the world and the zoo in Lima has to be one of the best I have seen. It looks like that they have spent a lot of money upgrading the original space. Still a lot of al unused enclosures around that need to be removed, but that does not",
          "Parque de la leyends (Lima's zoo) It is a great place to visit if you stay in Lima. Like many great places in Lima is not touristic, for me that's a plus. You can see a variety of animals that only live in Peru, in their different regions (amazon, sierra and coast) their botanic",

        "wiki": "Lima (, Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8lima]; Quechua: Limaq) is the capital and the largest city of Peru. It is located in the valleys of the Chill\u00f3n, R\u00edmac and Lur\u00edn rivers, in the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Together with the seaport of Callao, it forms a contiguous urban area known as the Lima Metropolitan Area. With a population of more than 9 million, Lima is the most populous metropolitan area of Peru and the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the Americas.\nLima was named by natives in the agricultural region known by native Peruvians as Limaq. It became the capital and most important city in the Viceroyalty of Peru. Following the Peruvian War of Independence, it became the capital of the Republic of Peru (Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa). Around one-third of the national population lives in the metropolitan area.\nLima is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The National University of San Marcos, founded on 12 May 1551, during the Spanish colonial empire, is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas.\nNowadays the city is considered to be the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of the country. Internationally, it is one of the thirty most populated urban agglomerations in the world. Due to its geostrategic importance, it has been defined as a \"beta\" city.\nJurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller portion, to the west, within the constitutional province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Ch\u00e1vez airport are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.\nIn October 2013, Lima was chosen to host the 2019 Pan American Games, these games were held at venues in and around Lima, and were the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country. It also hosted the APEC Meetings of 2008 and 2016, the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group in October 2015,  the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2014, and the Miss Universe 1982 contest.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAccording to early Spanish articles the Lima area was once called Itchyma, after its original inhabitants. However, even before the Inca occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the R\u00edmac valley had come to be known by visitors as Limaq (Limaq, pronounced [\u02c8li.m\u0251q], which means \"talker\" or \"speaker\" in the coastal Quechua that was the area's primary language before the Spanish arrival). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted: the chronicles show \"L\u00edmac\" replacing \"Ychma\" as the common name for the area.Modern scholars speculate that the word \"Lima\" originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects stop consonants in word-final position. Non-Peruvian Spanish speakers may mistakenly define the city name as the direct Spanish translation of \"lime\", the citrus fruit.\n\nThe city was founded in 1535 under the name City of Kings (Spanish: Ciudad de los Reyes) because its foundation was decided on 6 January, date of the feast of the Epiphany. This name quickly fell into disuse, and Lima became the city's name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both Lima and Ciudad de los Reyes can be seen together.\nThe river that feeds Lima is called R\u00edmac and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is \"Talking River\" (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua in which the word for \"talker\" was pronounced [\u02c8rim\u0251q]). However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the Cuzco nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of Cuzco Quechua.\nLater, as the original inhabitants died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. Nowadays, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\n\n=== Flag ===\nHistorically, the Flag of Lima has been known as the \"Banner of Peru's Kings' City\". It is made from a golden-colored silk canvas and embroidered in the center is its coat of arms.\n\n\n=== Anthem ===\nLima's anthem was heard for the first time on 18 January 2008, in a formal meeting with important politicians, including Peruvian President Alan Garc\u00eda, and other authorities. The anthem was created by Luis Enrique Tord (lyrics), Euding Maeshiro (music) and record producer Ricardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez (arranger).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the pre-Columbian era, what is now Lima was inhabited by indigenous groups under the Ychsma policy, which was incorporated into the Inca Empire in the 15th century. In 1532 a group of Spanish conquistadors, led by Francisco Pizarro, defeated the Inca ruler Atahualpa and took over his empire.\n\nSince the Spanish Crown had appointed Pizarro governor of the lands he conquered, he chose the R\u00edmac Valley to found his capital on 18 January 1535, as Ciudad de los Reyes (City of Kings). In August 1536, rebel Inca troops led by Manco Inca Yupanqui besieged the city but were defeated by the Spaniards and their native allies.Lima gained prestige after being designated capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. During the next century it flourished as the centre of an extensive trade network that integrated the Viceroyalty with the rest of the Americas, Europe and the Far East. However, the city was not free from dangers; the presence of pirates and privateers in the Pacific Ocean lead to the building of the Walls of Lima between 1684 and 1687. The 1687 Peru earthquake destroyed most of the city buildings; the earthquake marked a turning point in the city's history as it coincided with a trade recession and growing economic competition with cities such as Buenos Aires.In 1746, another powerful earthquake severely damaged Lima and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy Jos\u00e9 Antonio Manso de Velasco. In the later half of the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas on public health and social control shaped development. During this period, Lima was adversely affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and its control over the mining region of Upper Peru. The city's economic decline left its elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence.A combined expedition of Argentine and Chilean patriots under General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn landed south of Lima in 1820 but did not attack the city. Faced with a naval blockade and the action of guerrillas on land, Viceroy Jos\u00e9 de la Serna e Hinojosa evacuated its capital in July 1821 to save the Royalist army. Fearing a popular uprising and lacking any means to impose order, the city council invited San Mart\u00edn to enter Lima and signed a Declaration of Independence at his request. However, the war was not over; in the next two years the city changed hands several times.\nAfter independence, Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru but economic stagnation and political turmoil brought urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid development of the city. The export-led expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest. During the 1879\u20131883 War of the Pacific, Chilean troops occupied Lima, looting public museums, libraries and educational institutions. At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian population; sacking their properties and businesses. The city underwent renewal and expansion from the 1890s to the 1920s. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of broad avenues that crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns.On 24 May 1940 an earthquake destroyed most of the city, which at that time was mostly built of adobe and quincha. In the 1940s Lima started a period of rapid growth spurred by migration from the Andean region, as rural people sought opportunities for work and education. The population, estimated at 600,000 in 1940, reached 1.9 million by 1960 and 4.8 million by 1980. At the start of this period, the urban area was confined to a triangular area bounded by the city's historic centre, Callao and Chorrillos; in the following decades settlements spread to the north, beyond the R\u00edmac River, to the east, along the Central Highway and to the south. The new migrants, at first confined to slums in downtown Lima, led this expansion through large-scale land invasions, which evolved into shanty towns, known as pueblos j\u00f3venes.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe urban area covers about 800 km2 (310 sq mi). It is located on mostly flat terrain in the Peruvian coastal plain, within the valleys of the Chill\u00f3n, R\u00edmac and Lur\u00edn rivers. The city slopes gently from the shores of the Pacific Ocean into valleys and mountain slopes located as high as 1,550 meters (5,090 ft) above sea level. Within the city are isolated hills that are not connected to the surrounding hill chains, such as El Agustino, San Cosme, El Pino, La Milla, Muleria and Pro hills. The San Cristobal hill in the R\u00edmac District, which lies directly north of the downtown area, is the local extreme of an Andean hill outgrowth.\nMetropolitan Lima covers 2,672.28 km2 (1,031.77 sq mi), of which 825.88 km2 (318.87 sq mi) (31%) comprise the actual city and 1,846.40 km2 (712.90 sq mi) (69%) the city outskirts. The urban area extends around 60 km (37 mi) from north to south and around 30 km (19 mi) from west to east. The city center is located 15 km (9.3 mi) inland at the shore of the R\u00edmac River, a vital resource for the city, since it carries what will become drinking water for its inhabitants and fuels the hydroelectric dams that provide electricity to the area. While no official administrative definition for the city exists, it is usually considered to be composed of the central 30 of 43 districts of Lima Province, corresponding to an urban area centered around the historic Cercado de Lima district. The city is the core of the Lima Metro Area, one of the ten largest metro areas in the Americas. Lima is the world's third largest desert city, after Karachi, Pakistan and Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDespite its location in the tropics and in a desert, Lima's proximity to the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean leads to temperatures much lower than those expected for a tropical desert and thus Lima can be classified as a desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWh) with subtropical temperature ranges. Temperatures rarely fall below 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) or rise above 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F). Two distinct seasons can be identified: summer, from December through April; and winter from June through October. May and November are generally transition months, with a more dramatic warm-to-cool weather transition.\nDaily temperatures oscillate between lows of 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) and highs of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) to 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F). Frequent coastal fogs on many mornings and high clouds in some afternoons and evenings can be present, namely, between the months of May and October. Summer sunsets are colorful, labeled by locals as \"cielo de brujas\" (Spanish for \"sky of witches\"), since the sky commonly turns shades of orange, pink and red around 7 pm. Winter weather is dramatically different. Grey skies, breezy conditions, higher humidity and cooler temperatures prevail. Long (2-weeks or more) stretches of dark overcast skies are not uncommon. Persistent morning drizzle occurs occasionally from June through September, coating the streets with a thin layer of water that generally dries up by early afternoon. Winter temperatures vary little between day and night. They range from lows of 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) and highs of 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) to 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F), rarely exceeding 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) except in the easternmost districts.Relative humidity is always very high, particularly in the mornings. High humidity produces brief morning fog in the early summer and a usually persistent low cloud deck during the winter (generally developing in May and persisting into late November or even early December). The predominantly onshore flow makes the Lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire Peruvian coast. Lima has only 1284 hours of sunshine a year, 28.6 hours in July and 184 hours in April, which is exceptionally little for the latitude. By comparison, London has an average of 1653 hours of sunshine per year, and Moscow 1731 hours of sunshine per year. Winter cloudiness prompts locals to seek for sunshine in Andean valleys located at elevations generally above 500 meters above sea level.\nWhile relative humidity is high, rainfall is very low due to strong atmospheric stability. The severely low rainfall impacts on water supply in the city, which originates from wells and from rivers that flow from the Andes. Inland districts receive anywhere between 1 and 6 cm (2.4 in) of rainfall per year, which accumulates mainly during the winter months. Coastal districts receive only 1 to 3 cm (1.2 in). As previously mentioned, winter precipitation occurs in the form of persistent morning drizzle events. These are locally called 'gar\u00faa', 'llovizna' or 'camanchacas'. Summer rain, on the other hand, is infrequent and occurs in the form of isolated light and brief showers. These generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from Andean storms arrive from the east. The lack of heavy rainfall arises from high atmospheric stability caused, in turn, by the combination of cool waters from semi-permanent coastal upwelling and the presence of the cold Humboldt Current and warm air aloft associated with the South Pacific anticyclone.\nLima's climate (like that of most of coastal Peru) gets severely disrupted in El Ni\u00f1o events. Coastal waters usually average around 17\u201319 \u00b0C (63\u201366 \u00b0F), but get much warmer (as in 1998 when the water reached 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F)). Air temperatures rise accordingly.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith a municipal population of 8,852,000 and 9,752,000 for the metropolitan area and a population density of 3,008.8 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,793/sq mi) as of 2007. Lima ranks as the 30th most populous 'agglomeration' in the world, as of 2014, and the second biggest city in South America in terms of population within city limits, after S\u00e3o Paulo. Its population features a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups. Mestizos of mixed Amerindian and European (mostly Spanish and Italians) ancestry are the largest ethnic group. European Peruvians (White people) are the second largest group. Many are of Spanish, Italian or German descent; many others are of French, British, or Croatian descent. The minorities in Lima include Amerindians (mostly Aymara and Quechua) and Afro-Peruvians, whose African ancestors were initially brought to the region as slaves. Jews of European descent and Middle Easterners are there. Asians, especially of Chinese (Cantonese) and Japanese descent, came mostly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Lima has, by far, the largest ethnic Chinese community in Latin America.\n\nThe first settlement in what would become Lima was made up of 117 housing blocks. In 1562, another district was built across the R\u00edmac River and in 1610, the first stone bridge was built. Lima then had a population of around 26,000; blacks made up around 40% and whites made up around 38%. By 1748, the white population totaled 16,000\u201318,000. In 1861, the number of inhabitants surpassed 100,000 and by 1927, had doubled.During the early 20th century, thousands of immigrants came to the city, including people of European descent. They organized social clubs and built their own schools. Examples are The American-Peruvian school, the Alianza Francesa de Lima, the Lyc\u00e9e Franco-P\u00e9ruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; Markham College, the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, Antonio Raymondi District Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also, several German-Peruvian schools.\nChinese and a lesser number of Japanese came to Lima and established themselves in the Barrios Altos neighborhood in downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their Chinatown as Calle Capon and the city's ubiquitous Chifa restaurants \u2013 small, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisine \u2013 can be found by the dozens in this enclave.\nIn 2014, the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica) reported that the population in Lima's 49 districts was 9,752,000 people, including the Constitutional Province of Callao. The city and (metropolitan area) represents around 29% of the national population. Of the city's population 48.7% are men and 51.3% are women. The 49 districts in Metropolitan Lima are divided into 5 areas: Cono Norte (North Lima), Lima Este (East Lima), Constitutional Province of Callao, Lima Centro (Central Lima) and Lima Sur (South Lima). The largest areas are Lima Norte with 2,475,432 people and Lima Este with 2,619,814 people, including the largest single district San Juan de Lurigancho, which hosts 1 million people.Lima is considered a \"young\" city. According to INEI, by mid 2014 the age distribution in Lima was: 24.3% between 0 and 14, 27.2% between 15 and 29, 22.5% between 30 and 44, 15.4% between 45 and 59 and 10.6% above 60.Migration to Lima from the rest of Peru is substantial. In 2013, 3,480,000 people reported arriving from other regions. This represents almost 36% of the entire population of Metropolitan Lima. The three regions that supply most of the migrants are Junin, Ancash and Ayacucho. By contrast only 390,000 emigrated from Lima to other regions.The annual population growth rate is 1.57%. Some of the 43 metropolitan districts are considerably more populous than others. For example, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Ate, Comas, Villa El Salvador and Villa Maria del Triunfo host more than 400,000, while San Luis, San Isidro, Magdalena del Mar, Lince and Barranco have less than 60,000 residents.A 2005 household survey study shows a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6,000 soles (around US$1,840) or more for socioeconomic level A; between 2,000 soles (US$612) and 6,000 soles (US$1,840) for level B; from 840 soles (US$257) to 2,000 soles (US$612) for level C; from 420 soles (US$128) to 1200 soles (US$368) for level D; and up to 840 soles (US$257) for level E. In Lima, 18% were in level E; 32.3% in level D; 31.7% in level C; 14.6% in level B; and 3.4% in level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 soles (or US$612) monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.\nIn Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the percentage of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The level of poverty is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The level of poverty has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%). In addition 0.2% of the population lives in extreme poverty, meaning that they are unable to access a basic food basket.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLima is the country's industrial and financial center and one of Latin America's most important financial centers, home to many national companies and hotels. It accounts for more than two-thirds of Peru's industrial production and most of its tertiary sector.\nThe Metropolitan area, with around 7,000 factories, is the main location of industry. Products include textiles, clothing and food. Chemicals, fish, leather and oil derivatives are manufactured and processed. The financial district is in San Isidro, while much of the industrial activity takes place in the west of the city, extending to the airport in Callao. Lima has the largest export industry in South America and is a regional center for the cargo industry.\n\nIndustrialization began in the 1930s and by 1950, through import substitution policies, manufacturing made up 14% of GNP. In the late 1950s, up to 70% of consumer goods were manufactured in factories located in Lima.The Callao seaport is one of the main fishing and commerce ports in South America, covering over 47 hectares (120 acres) and shipping 20.7 million tonnes of cargo in 2007. The main export goods are commodities: oil, steel, silver, zinc, cotton, sugar and coffee.\nAs of 2003, Lima generated 53% of GDP. Most foreign companies in Peru settled in Lima.\nIn 2007, the Peruvian economy grew 9%, the largest growth rate in South America. The Lima Stock Exchange rose 185.24% in 2006 and in 2007 by another 168.3%, making it then one of the fastest growing stock exchanges in the world. In 2006, the Lima Stock Exchange was the world's most profitable.The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit 2008 and the Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union Summit were held there.\nLima is the headquarters for banks such as Banco de Cr\u00e9dito del Per\u00fa, Scotiabank Per\u00fa, Interbank, Bank of the Nation, Banco Continental, MiBanco, Banco Interamericano de Finanzas, Banco Financiero, Banco de Comercio and CrediScotia. It is a regional headquarters for Standard Chartered. Insurance companies based in Lima include Rimac Seguros, Mapfre Peru, Interseguro, Pacifico, Protecta and La Positiva.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== National ===\nLima is the capital city of the Republic of Peru and Lima province. As such, it is home to the three branches of the Government of Peru.\nThe executive branch is headquartered in the Government Palace, located in the Plaza Mayor. All ministries are located in the city.\nThe legislative branch is headquartered in the Legislative Palace and is home to the Congress of the Republic of Peru.\nThe Judicial branch is headquartered in the Palace of Justice and is home to the Supreme Court of Peru. The Palace of Justice in Lima is seat of the Supreme Court of Justice the highest judicial court in Peru with jurisdiction over the entire territory of Peru. Lima is seat of two of the 28-second highest or Superior Courts of Justice. The first and oldest Superior Court in Lima is the Superior Court of Justice, belonging to the Judicial District and. Due to the judicial organization of Peru, the highest concentration of courts is located in Lima despite the fact that its judicial district has jurisdiction over only 35 of the 43 districts. The Superior Court of the Cono Norte is the second Superior Court located in Lima and is part of the Judicial District of North Lima. This judicial district has jurisdiction over the remaining eight districts, all located in northern Lima.\n\n\n=== Local ===\n\nThe city is roughly equivalent to the Province of Lima, which is subdivided into 43 districts. The Metropolitan Municipality has authority over the entire city, while each district has its own local government. Unlike the rest of the country, the Metropolitan Municipality, although a provincial municipality, acts as and has functions similar to a regional government, as it does not belong to any of the 25 regions of Peru. Each of the 43 districts has their own distrital municipality that is in charge of its own district and coordinate with the metropolitan municipality.\n\n\n=== Political system ===\nUnlike the rest of the country, the Metropolitan Municipality has functions of regional government and is not part of any administrative region, according to Article 65. 27867 of the Law of Regional Governments enacted on 16 November 2002, 87 The previous political organization remains in the sense that a Governor is the political authority for the department and the city. The functions of this authority are mostly police and military. The same city administration covers the local municipal authority.\n\n\n=== International organizations ===\nLima is home to the headquarters of the Andean Community of Nations that is a customs union comprising the South American countries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Along with other regional and international organizations.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nLima's architecture offers a mix of styles. Examples of early colonial architecture include the Monastery of San Francisco, the Cathedral and the Torre Tagle Palace. These constructions are generally influenced by Spanish Baroque, Spanish Neoclassical and Spanish Colonial styles. After independence, preferences gradually shifted toward neoclassical and Art Nouveau styles. Many of these works were influenced by French architectural styles. Many government buildings and major cultural institutions were constructed in this period. During the 1960s, the brutalist style began appearing in Lima due to the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado. Examples of this architecture include the Museum of the Nation and the Ministry of Defense. The early 21st century added glass skyscrapers, particularly around the financial district.The largest parks are in the centre area, including the Park of the Reserve, Park of the Exposition, Campo de Marte and University Park. The Park of the Reserve is home to the largest fountain complex in the world known as the Magical Circuit of Water. Many large parks lie outside the city center, including Reducto Park, Pantanos de Villa Wildlife Refuge, El Golf (San Isidro), Parque de las Leyendas (Lima Zoo), El Malecon de Miraflores and the Golf Los Incas.The street grid is laid out with a system of plazas that are similar to roundabouts or junctions. In addition to this practical purpose, plazas serve as principal green spaces and contain monuments, statues and water fountains.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\nStrongly influenced by European, Andean, African and Asian culture, Lima is a melting pot, due to colonization, immigration and indigenous influences. The Historic Centre was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.\nThe city is known as the Gastronomical Capital of the Americas, mixing Spanish, Andean and Asian culinary traditions.Lima's beaches, located along the northern and southern ends of the city, are heavily visited during the summer. Restaurants, clubs and hotels serve the beachgoers. Lima has a vibrant and active theater scene, including classic theater, cultural presentations, modern theater, experimental theater, dramas, dance performances and theater for children. Lima is home to the Municipal Theater, Segura Theater, Japanese-Peruvian Theater, Marsano Theater, British theater, Theater of the PUCP Cultural Center and the Yuyachkani Theater.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nKnown as Peruvian Coast Spanish, Lima's Spanish is characterized by the lack of strong intonations as found in many other Spanish-speaking regions. It is heavily influenced by Castilian Spanish. Throughout the Viceroyalty era, most of the Spanish nobility based in Lima were originally from Castile. Limean Castillian is also characterized by the lack of voseo, unlike many other Hispanic American countries. This is because voseo was primarily used by Spain's lower socioeconomic classes, a social group that did not begin to appear in Lima until the late colonial era.Limean Spanish is distinguished by its clarity in comparison to other Latin American accents and has been influenced by immigrant groups including Italians, Andalusians, West Africans, Chinese and Japanese. It also has been influenced by anglicisms as a result of globalization, as well as by Andean Spanish and Quechua, due to migration from the Andean highlands.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLima is home to the country's highest concentration of museums, most notably the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda, Antropolog\u00eda e Historia del Per\u00fa, Museum of Art, the Museo Pedro de Osma, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the Nation, The Sala Museo Oro del Per\u00fa Larcomar, the Museum of Italian Art, the Museum of Gold and the Larco Museum. These museums focus on art, pre-Columbian cultures, natural history, science and religion. The Museum of Italian Art shows European art.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe Historic Centre, made up of the districts of Lima and R\u00edmac, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. Some examples of colonial architecture include the Monastery of San Francisco, the Plaza Mayor, the Cathedral, Convent of Santo Domingo and the Palace of Torre Tagle.\nA tour of the city's churches is a popular circuit. A trip through the central district visits churches dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, the most noteworthy of which are the Cathedral and the Monastery of San Francisco, said to be connected by catacombs. Both contain paintings, Sevilian tile and sculpted wood furnishings.\nAlso notable is the Sanctuary of Las Nazarenas, the point of origin for the Lord of Miracles, whose festivities in the month of October constitute the city's most important religious event. Some sections of the Walls remain and are frequented by tourists. These examples of medieval Spanish fortifications were built to defend the city from attacks by pirates and privateers.Beaches are visited during the summer months, located along the Pan-American Highway, to the south of the city in districts such as Lur\u00edn, Punta Hermosa, Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar (Peru), San Bartolo, Miraflores beach and Asia.The archeological site Huaca Pucllana is a great adobe and clay pyramid located in the Miraflores district, built from seven staggered platforms. It served as an important ceremonial and administrative center for the advancement of the Lima culture.\nThe suburban districts of Cieneguilla, Pachacamac and the city of Chosica, are tourist attractions among locals. Because they are located at a higher elevation than Lima, they receive more sunshine in winter months, something that the city frequently lacks under seasonal fog.According to Mastercard's Global Destination Cities Index 2019, Lima is the top destination in South America, with 2.63 million international visitors in 2018 and a growth forecast of 10.00% percent for 2019.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nLima is known as the Gastronomical Capital of the Americas. A center of immigration and the center of the Spanish Viceroyalty, chefs incorporated dishes brought by the conquistadors and waves of immigrants: African, European, Chinese and Japanese. Since the second half of the 20th century, international immigrants were joined by internal migrants from rural areas. Lima cuisines include Creole food, Chifas, Cebicherias and Pollerias.In the 21st century, its restaurants became recognized internationally.In 2007, the Peruvian Society for Gastronomy was born with the objective of uniting Peruvian gastronomy to put together activities that would promote Peruvian food and reinforce the Peruvian national identity. The society, called APEGA, gathered chefs, nutritionists, institutes for gastronomical training, restaurant owners, chefs and cooks, researchers and journalists. They worked with universities, food producers, artisanal fishermen and sellers in food markets. One of their first projects (2008) was to create the largest food festival in Latin America, called Mistura (\"mixture\" in Portuguese). The fair takes place in September every year. The number of attendees has grown from 30,000 to 600,000 in 2014. The fair congregates restaurants, food producers, bakers, chefs, street vendors and cooking institutes from for ten days to celebrate excellent food.Since 2011, several Lima restaurants have been recognized as among The World's 50 Best Restaurants.\nIn 2016, Central was awarded No. 4 (chefs Virgilio Martinez and Pia Leon), Maido was awarded No. 13 (chef Mitsuharu Tsumura) and Astrid & Gaston was awarded No. 30 (chef Diego Mu\u00f1oz and owned by chef Gaston Acurio). In addition, Central was named No. 1 restaurant in the list of Latin America's 50 Best Restaurants 2015. Out of the 50 best restaurants in Latin America, we find: Central #1, Astrid & Gaston #3, Maido #5, La Mar #12, Malabar #20, Fiesta #31, Osso Carnicer\u00eda y Salumer\u00eda #34, La Picanteria #36 and Rafael #50. These restaurants fuse ideas from across the country and the world.\nPeruvian coffee and chocolate have also won international awards.Lima is the Peruvian city with the greatest variety and where different dishes representing South American cuisine can be found.\n\nCeviche is Peru's national dish and it's made from salt, garlic, onions, hot Peruvian peppers, and raw fish that's all marinated in lime. In Northern Peru, one can find black-oyster ceviche, mixed seafood ceviche, crab and lobster ceviche. In the Andes one can also find trout ceviche and chicken ceviche.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe city and has sports venues for football, golf, volleyball and basketball, many within private clubs. A popular sport among Limenos is fronton, a racquet sport similar to squash invented in Lima. The city is home to seven international-class golf links. Equestrianism is popular in Lima with private clubs as well as the Hip\u00f3dromo de Monterrico horse racing track. The most popular sport in Lima is football with professional club teams operating in the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe historic Plaza de toros de Acho, located in the R\u00edmac District, a few minutes from the Plaza de Armas, holds bullfights yearly. The season runs from late October to December.\nLima is the host of 2019 Pan American Games.The 131st IOC Session was held in Lima. The meeting saw Paris elected to host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Los Angeles elected to host the 2028 Summer Olympics.\nLima will have 2 venues for the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\n\n\n== Subdivisions ==\n\nLima is made up of thirty-one densely populated districts, each headed by a local mayor and the Mayor of Lima, whose authority extends to these and the twelve outer districts of the Lima province.\nThe city's historic centre is located in the Cercado de Lima district, locally known as simply Lima, or as \"El Centro\" (\"Centre\"). It is home to most of the vestiges the colonial past, the Presidential Palace (Spanish: Palacio de Gobierno), the Metropolitan Municipality and (Spanish: Consejo municipal metropolitano de Lima), Chinatown and dozens of hotels, some operating and some defunct, that cater to the national and international elite.\nThe upscale San Isidro District is the city's financial center. It is home to politicians and celebrities. San Isidro has parks, including Parque El Olivar, which is home to olive trees imported from Spain during the seventeenth century. The Lima Golf Club, a prominent golf club, is located within the district.\nAnother upscale district is Miraflores, which has luxury hotels, shops and restaurants. Miraflores has parks and green areas, more than most other districts. Larcomar, a shopping mall and entertainment center built on cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean, featuring bars, dance clubs, movie theaters, cafes, shops, boutiques and galleries, is also located in this district. Nightlife, shopping and entertainment center around Parque Kennedy, a park in the heart of Miraflores.La Molina, San Borja, Santiago de Surco -home to the American Embassy and the exclusive Club Polo Lima - are the other three wealthy districts. The middle class districts in Lima are Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, Lince, Magdalena del Mar, Pueblo Libre, San Miguel and Barranco.\nThe most densely populated districts lie in Northern and Southern Lima, where the suburbs of the city begin (Spanish: Cono Norte and Cono Sur, respectively) and they are mostly composed of Andean immigrants who arrived during the mid- and late- 20th century looking for a better life and economic opportunity, or as refugees of the country's internal conflict with the Shining Path during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the case of Cono Norte (now called Lima Norte), shopping malls such as Megaplaza and Royal Plaza were built in the Independencia district, on the border with the Los Olivos district (the most residential neighborhood in the northern part). Most inhabitants are middle or lower middle class.\nBarranco, which borders Miraflores by the Pacific Ocean, is the city's bohemian district, home or once home of writers and intellectuals including Mario Vargas Llosa, Chabuca Granda and Alfredo Bryce Echenique. This district has restaurants, music venues called \"pe\u00f1as\" featuring the traditional folk music of coastal Peru (in Spanish, \"m\u00fasica criolla\") and Victorian-style chalets. Along with Miraflores it serves as the home to the foreign nightlife scene.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nHome to universities, institutions and schools, Lima has the highest concentration of institutions of higher learning on the continent. Lima is home to the oldest continuously operating higher learning institution in the New World, National University of San Marcos, founded in 1551.Universidad Nacional de Ingenier\u00eda (UNI) was founded in 1876 by Polish engineer Edward Habich and is the country's most important engineering school. Other public universities offer teaching and research, such as the Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal (the second largest), the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina (where ex-president Alberto Fujimori once taught) and the National University of Callao.\nThe Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, established in 1917, is the oldest private university. Other private institutions include Universidad del Pacifico, Universidad ESAN, Universidad de Lima, Universidad de San Mart\u00edn de Porres, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista and Universidad Ricardo Palma.The city and has a total of 8,047 elementary and high schools, both public and private, which educate more than one and a half million students. The number of private schools is much greater than public schools (6,242 vs 1,805) while the average size of private schools is 100 for elementary and 130 for high school. Public schools average 400 students in elementary and 500 in high school.\n\nLima has one of the country's highest levels of enrollment in high school and preschool. 86.1% of high school-age students are in school, vs the national average of 80.7%. In early childhood, the enrollment level in Lima is 84.7%, while the national average is 74.5%. Early childhood enrollment has improved by 12.1% since 2005. In elementary school, the enrollment in Lima is 90.7%, while the national average for this level is 92.9%.The dropout rate for Lima is lower than the national average, except for elementary school, which is higher. In Lima, the dropout rate in elementary is 1.3% and 5.7% in high school, while the national average is 1.2% in elementary and 8.3% in high school.In Peru, students grade second and fourth students take a test called \"Evaluacion Censal de Estudiantes\" (ECE). The test assesses skills in reading comprehension and math. Scores are grouped in three levels: Below level 1 means that students were not able to respond to even the most simple questions; level 1 means the students did not achieve the expected level in skills but could respond to simple questions; and level 2 means they achieved/exceeded the expected skills for their grade level. In 2012, 48.7% of students in Lima achieved level 2 in reading comprehension compared to 45.3% in 2011. In math, only 19.3% students achieved level 2, with 46.4% at level 1 and 34.2% less than level 1. Even though the results for Math are lower than for reading, in both subject areas performance increased in 2012 over 2011. The city performs much better than the national average in both disciplines.The educational system in Lima is organized under the authority of the \"Direccion Regional de Educacion (DRE) de Lima Metropolitana\", which is in turn divided into 7 sub-directions or \"UGEL\" (Unidad de Gestion Educativa Local): UGEL 01 (San Juan de Miraflores, Villa Maria del Triunfo, Villa El Salvador, Lurin, Pachacamac, San Bartolo, Punta Negra, Punta Hermosa, Pucusana, Santa Maria and Chilca), UGEL 02 (Rimac, Los Olivos, Independencia, Rimac and San Martin de Porres), UGEL 03 (Cercado, Lince, Bre\u00f1a, Pueblo Libre, San Miguel, Magdalena, Jesus Maria, La Victoria and San Isidro), UGEL 04 (Comas, Carabayllo, Puente Piedra, Santa Rosa and Ancon), UGEL 05 (San Juan de Lurigancho and El Agustino), UGEL 06 (Santa Anita, Lurigancho-Chosica, Vitarte, La Molina, Cieneguilla and Chaclacayo) and UGEL 07 (San Borja, San Luis, Surco, Surquillo, Miraflores, Barranco and Chorrillos).The UGELes with highest results on the ECE 2012 are UGEL 07 and 03 in both reading comprehension and math. UGEL 07 had 60.8% students achieving level 2 in reading comprehension and 28.6% students achieving level 2 in Math. UGEL 03 had 58.5% students achieve level 2 in reading comprehension and 24.9% students achieving level 2 in math. The lowest achieving UGELs are UGEL 01, 04 and 05.23% of men have completed university education in Lima, compared to 20% of women. Additionally, 16.2% of men have completed non-university higher education along with 17% of women. The average years of schooling in the city is 11.1 years (11.4 for men and 10.9 for women).\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nLima is served by Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport, located in Callao (LIM). It is the country's largest airport hosting the largest number of domestic and international passengers.\nIt serves as the fourth-largest hub in the Latin American air network. Lima possesses five other airports: the Las Palmas Air Force Base, Collique Airport and runways in Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar, San Bartolo and Chilca.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nLima is a major stop on the Pan-American Highway. Because of its location on the country's central coast, Lima is an important junction in Peru's highway system. Three major highways originate in Lima.\n\nThe Northern Panamerican Highway extends more than 1,330 kilometers (830 mi) to the border with Ecuador connecting the northern districts and with many major cities along the northern Peruvian coast.\nThe Central Highway (Spanish: Carretera Central) connects the eastern districts and with cities in central Peru. The highway extends 860 kilometers (530 mi) with its terminus at the city of Pucallpa near Brazil.\nThe Southern Panamerican Highway connects the southern districts and to cities on the southern coast. The highway extends 1,450 kilometers (900 mi) to the border with Chile.The city has one big bus terminal next to the mall Plaza Norte. This bus station is the point of departure and arrival point for national and international destinations. Other bus stations serve private bus companies around the city. In addition, informal bus stations are located in the south, center and north of the city.\n\n\n=== Maritime ===\n\nLima's proximity to the port of Callao allows Callao to act as the metropolitan area's major port and one of Latin America's largest. Callao hosts nearly all maritime transport for the metropolitan area. A small port in Lur\u00edn serves oil tankers due to a nearby refinery. Maritime transport inside Lima city limits is relatively insignificant compared to that of Callao.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nLima is connected to the Central Andean region by the Ferrocarril Central Andino which runs from Lima through the departments of Jun\u00edn, Huancavelica, Pasco and Hu\u00e1nuco. Major cities along this line include Huancayo, La Oroya, Huancavelica and Cerro de Pasco. Another inactive line runs from Lima northwards to the city of Huacho. Commuter rail services for Lima are planned as part of the larger Tren de la Costa project.\n\n\n=== Public ===\n\nLima's road network is based mostly on large divided avenues rather than freeways. Lima operates a network of nine freeways \u2013 the Via Expresa Paseo de la Republica, Via Expresa Javier Prado, Via Expresa Grau, Panamericana Norte, Panamericana Sur, Carretera Central, Via Expresa Callao, Autopista Chillon Trapiche and the Autopista Ramiro Priale.According to a 2012 survey, the majority of the population uses public or collective transportation (75.6%), while 12.3% uses a car, taxi or motorcycle.The urban transport system is composed of over 652 transit routes that are served by buses, microbuses and combis. The system is unorganized and is characterized by its informality. The service is run by 464 private companies that are poorly regulated by local government. Fares average one sol or US$0.40.\nTaxis are mostly informal and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary in size from small four-door compacts to large vans. They account for a large part of the car stock. In many cases they are just a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. Additionally, several companies provide on-call taxi service.\n\n\n==== Colectivos ====\nColectivos render express service on some major roads. The colectivos signal their specific destination with a sign on their windshield. Their routes are not generally publicitized but are understood by frequent users. The cost is generally higher than public transport; however, they cover greater distances at greater speeds due to the lack of stops. This service is informal and is illegal. Some people in the periphery use so-called \"mototaxis\" for short distances.\n\n\n==== Metropolitan Transport System ====\n\nThe Metropolitan Transport System or El Metropolitano is a new, integrated system, consisting of a network of buses that run in exclusive corridors under the Bus Rapid Transit system (BST). The goal is to reduce passengers' commute times, protect the environment, provide improved security and overall quality of service. Metropolitano was executed with funds from the City of Lima and financing from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Metropolitana is the first BRT system to operate with natural gas, seeking to reduce air pollution. This system links the principal points of the Lima Metropolitan Area. The first phase of this project has 33 kilometres (21 mi) of line (north) to Chorrillos (south). It began commercial operations on 28 July 2010. Since 2014, Lima Council operates the \"Sistema Integrado de Transporte Urbano\" (Urban integrated transport system), which comprises buses over Avenida Arequipa. By the end of 2012, the Metropolitano system counted 244 buses in its central routes and 179 buses in its feeding routes. Weekday use averages 437,148 passengers. Usage increased since 2011 by 28.2% for weekdays, 29.1% for Saturdays and 33.3% for Sundays.\n\n\n==== Metro ====\nThe Lima Metro has twenty six passenger stations, located at an average distance of 1.2 km (0.7 miles). It begins in the Industrial Park of Villa El Salvador, south of the city, continuing on to Av. Pachac\u00fatec in Villa Mar\u00eda del Triunfo and then to Av. Los H\u00e9roes in San Juan de Miraflores. Afterwards, it continues through Av. Tom\u00e1s Marsano in Surco to reach Ov. Los Cabitos, to Av. Aviaci\u00f3n and then cross the river Rimac to finish, after almost 35 km (22 mi), in the east of the capital in San Juan de Lurigancho. The system operates 24 trains, each with six wagons. Each wagon has the capacity to transport 233 people. The metro system began operating in December 2012 and transported 78,224 people on average on a daily basis.\n\n\n=== Other transportation issues ===\nLima has high traffic congestion, especially at peak hours. 1 million 397 thousand vehicles were in use by the end of 2012. The region operates 65.3% of the cars in the country.The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) offered economic incentives for municipalities to implement bicycle routes in their districts. Recreational bike lanes can be found in 39 districts. The Proyecto Especial Metropolitano de Transporte No Motorizado (PEMTNM) estimates that more than a million and a half people used the bike lanes in 2012. The bike lanes ran for 71 km (44 mi). They estimate that the use of the bike lanes prevented the emission of 526 tons of carbon dioxide in 2012.San Borja district was the first to implement a bike-share program called San Borja en Bici. It supplied 200 bicycles and six stations across the district (two of them connecting with the Metro). By December 2012, the program had 2,776 subscribers.\n\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nLima suffers most from air pollution. The sedimentary dust has solid particles that settle as dust on different surfaces or float through the air. The fine particles are the most dangerous given that they are able to damage human respiratory systems. The recommended limit of these particles by the World Health Organization is 5 tons/km2/month. In February 2014, Lima recorded an average of 15.2 tons/km2. The two districts with the highest concentration of sedimentary dust are El Agustino (46.1 tons/km2) and Independencia (25.5 tons/km2) in February 2014.Lima has built billboards which serve as air purifiers.\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe permissible limit of lead in the water supply is 0.05 milligrams per liter, according to the Norm ITINTEC. In January 2014, the concentration of minerals in water treatment facilities of SEDAPAL was 0.051 iron, 0.005 lead, 0.0012 cadmium and 0.0810 aluminum. These values increased 15.9% and 33.3% in iron and cadmium with respect to January 2013 and a decrease of 16.7% and 12.4% in lead and aluminum. The values are within the recommended limits.\n\n\n==== Solid waste ====\nThe amount of solid waste produced per capita in Lima is about 0.7 kg (2 lb) per day. In 2012, each resident produced 273.36 kg (603 lb) of solid waste. The district municipalities only collect about 67% of the solid waste they generate. The rest ends up in informal landfills, rivers, or the ocean. Three municipalities recycle 20% or more of their waste.\n\n\n=== Access to basic services ===\nIn Lima, 93% of households have access to water supply in their homes. In addition, 92% of homes connect with sewage systems. 99.6% of homes have grid electric service. Although most households have water and sewage systems, some are available for only a few hours a day.\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe perception of security varies by district. For example, San Isidro has the lowest perception of insecurity (21.4%), while Rimac has the highest perception of insecurity (85%), according to a 2012 survey. The five districts with the lowest perception of insecurity are San Isidro, San Borja, Miraflores, La Molina and Jesus Maria. The districts with the highest perception of insecurity are Rimac, San Juan de Miraflores, La Victoria, Comas and Ate.Overall, 40% of the population in Lima above 15 years old has been a crime victim. The younger population (ages 15 to 29 years old) has the highest victimization rate (47.9%). In 2012, citizens reported thefts (47.9%): in homes or establishments (19.4%), robbery or attack (14.9%), gang aggression (5.7%), among others in lesser frequency. The districts with the highest level of victimization are Rimac, El Agustino, Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos. The safest districts by level of victimization are Lurin, Lurigancho-Chosica, San Borja, Magdalena and Surquillo. These districts do not necessarily correspond to the districts with highest or lowest perception of insecurity.While the Police force is nationally controlled and funded, each district in Lima has a community policing structure called Serenazgo.

          "All the pre-hispanic exbiit have now been moved to a different museum so now the Museo de la Nacion has less to offer for a visit. There is an exhibition on the architecture of the building, and those in the vicinity but this is not the same attraction I visited a few years ago.",
          "Although technically still open there are no, as in none, artifacts left in the museum. There is a new museum building being built at Pachamac which according to the personal at the museum will be open in 2020. However the way things move in Peru I wold not expect the museum",
          "My father and I travelled across the city to this museum as we thought it would tell us about the history of Peru. The building is next to the theatre but has no signs to tell you it is a museum. On entering, we had to put our backpacks in the storage area and nobody really knew",
          "There is no entry fee, also you must check in your backpack as they are not allowed on the museum floor. make sure you visit the shining path exhibition rooms on the 6th floor. They are a reminder of what it was like to live in Peru not too long ago.",
          "There was only minimal English description so non Spanish speakers would definitely struggle. No clear signage explaining what rooms/ floors there are. I was in and out within 20 mins. And it\u2019s painful to get to and leave as it\u2019s far away from any other attractions or popular",
          "I have taken several groups here to see the excellent exhibit about the history of the Shining Path terrorism in Peru. It is a great educational experience.",
          "It was great to see that Per\u00fa is not Just about the incas, lot of civilizations established all over Peru. I highly recommend It if you like ancient history. Artifacts of different types is what you Will see.",
          "It appeared to be a museum about museums and not really at that. Some interesting photos, but signs in Spanish. Difficult to capture all the explanations for those who do not speak the language. We thought we would want two hours minimum. Taxi driver said he would wait on us one",
          "Free entry, and far from almost everything. You can do it by bus. I went to very more info about the Shining Path, and I speak reasonable Spanish so I got it... The English is pretty much only the large wall descriptions and none on the photos themselves or the wall timeline.",
          "The main Museo is closed for renovation, I presume. But the photo and video exhibition \"Yuyanapaq\" To remember is excellent and I can't recommend visiting it enough. Yes it visually and viscerally challenging, but the choice of Per\u00fa to remember the violence is valuable for us",
          "When I first visited a few years ago this grandiosely named Museum housed in a huge building was a treasure trove of all aspects of the immensely rich and varied Peruvian cultural heritage. Re-visiting just two months ago in late December 2016 there was absolutely nothing",

          "We took a taxi to this museum from central lima (about 15 minutes, 8 soles) and spent about 45 minutes looking at the exhibits that are spread out across 3-4 floors. The first floor showcased a lot of ceramic statues, plates, ceremonial vases, etc. and the rest of the floors",
          "When we went to the museum on September 6, the English language version of the Shining Path film wasn't working. We were told it usually is available. The film would, I think, have made a huge difference in conveying the origins of the Shining Path movement and responses to it.",
          "If you want to know about what happened in Peru with the Shining Path-army conflict during 1980-2000, you must come here. There is a short video and photo exposition which tells you about the events based on the fact-finding work of the Comision de la Verdad investigations.",
          "Although the main collection is currently closed, the exhibition about the internal conflict in Peru (1980-2000) is amazing, very informative and well researched, including great fotographies. It sheds light on the crimes perpetrated by both terrorists (mostly Sendero Luminoso)",
          "I had a good time with my daughter. We learned a lot; however, know that if you ask the staff most of them don't know about the exhibits. They couldn't explain and tried to make stuff up. Other than that, it was good.",
          "Don't make the mistake I did. I spent close to 15 soles by taxi from Miraflores to this musem only to find it covered in scaffolding and plenty of construction. I asked a police officer and two bystanders if it was closed and I got a definite YES. I later found it from other",
          "This was probably my most favorite out of the museums that I visited in Lima. If disturbing pictures don't bother you and the history of a nation interests you, then this is the museum for you. The exhibits within this museum are mainly all about the brutal, bloody civil war",

          "Overall not that impressive but for the top floor exhibit which covers the 1980-2000 troubles in Peru and represents \"a final visual report for the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. Powerful and to me represents an important component for understanding an important part",
          "This was an excellent museum even though only about a third of the exhibits have English language translations. Nonetheless, the museum displays exhibits from the various cultures of Peru that led to the Incan hegemony. The museum gave us a solid understanding that Peru's",
          "This was our first trip to Peru so we thought the National museum would be a great place to visit. We left a little disappointed. It's an inexpensive trip, 3 soles per person when we went, and we did not have the option to get a guided tour. No information was given when we",
          "If you have seen the Larco and the archeology museum, this is worth a visit. There is a fascinating exhibit on the 6th floor of the Shining Path/MARTA terrorism in the 1980s. Also an overview of pre-colombian and colonial art",

          "The Larco Museum is better and has more comprehensive explanations, but I did find the 50 minute guided tour (15 soles for a private tour) worth while. There are lots of good photos and there are some English explanations. The Shining Path exhibition on the 6th floor is",

          "This is a good museum, but not great. We started on the level that gave a picture history of Peru since 1980. Very interesting to learn about the rise and fall of terrorism during that period. The whole thing is pictures and captions on the walls. It gets kind of old after Sala"

        "wiki": "The Palacio de Torre Tagle is a Spanish Baroque palace located at Jr. Ucayali 363, in downtown Lima, Peru, a couple blocks east of the Plaza de Armas. The palace currently is home to the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \nThe palace was commissioned in 1715 (some say 1730) by Don Jos\u00e9 Bernardo de Tagle y Bracho, 1st Marquis of Torre Tagle, who at the time was treasurer of the Royal Spanish fleet, for his own personal use as his home.\nThe exterior of the palace has a baroque stone doorway. The main facade is made from stone in the first wing and plaster in the second. The style is Sevillian baroque. The materials used in its construction were brought from Spain, Panama and Central America.  \nApart from carved columns, the palace is distinguished by two finely worked balconies in dark wood. These balconies (or miradors) adapt the European architecture to vernacular Peruvian tradition. The interiors feature Sevillian azulejos, plasterwork, wooden columns, lobed Mud\u00e9jar arches and soaring coffered ceilings. It is considered to have a true \"Lime\u00f1o\" architectural originality, harmoniously combining Andalusian, Mud\u00e9jar and Criollo features. \nThe public cannot easily visit the inside, but some visits can be made by appointment only at the office of 'Imagen Institucional del organismo p\u00fablico'.\n\n\n== Similar mansions ==\nSee: Balconies of Lima\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palacio de Torre Tagle at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado (17 October 1910 \u2013 9 September 1995) was a celebrated Bolivian sculptor.\nMarina N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado was one of the most respected sculptors from Latin America. N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado based many of her sculptures off of the female form as well as taking inspiration from animals and landscapes native to Bolivia. Her work is highly sensuous, with rolling curves. She carved from native Bolivian woods, as well as black granite, alabaster, basalt and white onyx. Perhaps one of her most famous works is \"White Venus\" (1960), a stylized female body in white onyx. Another celebrated work is \"Mother and Child,\" sculpted in white onyx. Indigenous Bolivian cultures inspired much of her work.\n\n\n== Bolivia and La Paz ==\nBolivia is known for its architecture, people, its oil industry, and its art. Its art is very distinct yet it was also influenced by a handful of western artistic movements that were being introduced. While these movements like Neo-classicism had a negative effect on sculpture, Bolivia still managed to have three stylistic periods known as Mannerism, Realism, and Hyperrealism. Each period had a handful of artists produce many unique works. For example in the Hyperrealist period, there were artists who made sculptures with real props attached to them, such as wigs or glasses. There was also a slight focus on religion with pieces like \"Christ of La Recoleta\" and \"Virgin of Copacabana\".La Paz, founded by Alonzo Mendoza in 1548, is the birthplace of Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez Del Prado. Due to art being imported from Spain, stylistic movements, such as Baroque, found their way into La Paz and were taught in Lake Titicaca School. Later, Mestizo Baroque, Neo-classicism and eventually Rococo began influencing the art and architecture of La Paz. One example of this is the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s, which used a combination of Baroque and Neo-classicism. While there was a lot of influence from newer movements like abstraction, around 1956, there was also a growing interest in making folk art and other traditional styles of art.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMarina N\u00fa\u00f1ez Del Prado was born in La Paz, Bolivia on October 17, 1910.  Del Prado first discovered her love of art in her youth while studying sculptural modeling techniques in La Paz. Her passion for sculpture was inspired by the work of Michelangelo as well as Miguel \u00c1ngel and later went on to study fine art at the Academy of Fine Arts in La Paz, graduating in 1930. Shortly after her graduation, she went on to have her first several exhibition in La Paz. She continued on at her alma mater as an instructor of artistic anatomy and sculpture. She became the first woman to achieve a position as the chair of the Academy.\nWhile she was working at the Academy of Fine Arts, La Paz, Del Prado began exhibiting locally. She was very artistically active, and collaborated with various artists, such as Cecilio Guzm\u00e1n de Rojas, a Bolivian painter who led the indigenous art movement at that time. Similarly Del Prado primarily focused her work on the rights of indigenous peoples and indigenismo, a political ideology centering the relationship of the indigenous population with the government.\nDel Prado left her job at the university and her home city of La Paz to travel in 1938. Some research stats that for the next eight years after her graduation, she specialized in artistic anatomy and won a gold medal from Argentina in 1936 and Berlin in 1938. She spent the next several years traveling through Peru, Uruguay, and Argentina. She then traveled to other countries outside of South America, including Egypt, parts of Europe, and the United States, where she studied for 8 years in New York on a fellowship awarded by the America Association of University Women.\nWhile in New York, Del Prado won a Gold Medal for her exhibition \u201cMiners in Rebellion.\u201d This work was centered on the workers of the Bolivian region of Potosi. Shortly after this, in 1948, Del Prado moved back to La Paz, where she continued to make work inspired by the indigenous peoples of South America, as well as the landscape and culture of her homeland. She later moved to Peru in 1972, where she lived with her husband, Jorge Falc\u00f3n, a writer native to Peru. With her four siblings, Del Prado donated the Casa Museo Marina Nu\u00f1ez del Prado to the people of Bolivia in memory of her parents. The museum houses over a thousand works of art, mostly done by Del Prado and some by her sister, Nilda. Del Prado passed away in Lima, Peru in 1995.\n\n\n== Art career ==\nIn 1938 she left her post and traveled through Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, the United States, Europe, and Egypt. From 1940 to 1948, she worked and organized exhibitions of her work in the United States while on a scholarship. In 1946 \"Miners in Revolt,\" inspired by the miners in Bolivia's Potos\u00ed Department, won a gold medal in a New York exhibition. In 1948 she returned to Bolivia, finally settling down in La Paz in 1958. By 1972 she moved to Peru where she lived with her husband, a Peruvian writer.\nWhile in New York, she made nude sculptures that were sixty inches tall and went to the Ettl Studios to learn how to cast. She then tried to apply to the American Association of University Women, or AAUW, but was rejected on her first attempt. Her second letter managed to convince Mary H. Smith as it showed her enthusiasm for art and education. Later, she found herself wanting to use her art to bring the world together by spreading information about her heritage as well as bring back what she learned to Bolivia. She had accomplished and learned a lot in New York like her style becoming more modern, for example. She then returned the favor by giving her piece, \"Mother and Child\", to the AAUW.Along her successful career she met outstanding artists such as Pablo Picasso, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, poets Gabriela Mistral, Alfonsina Storni and Juana de Ibarbourou. She was also a friend of the Bolivian writer Franz Tamayo.\nHer work has been the subject of international and national critique.  Botelho Gozalvez (1961) argues that her work is marked by two main characteristics: grace and strength. The strength is seen through her Andean landscapes and her grace is recognizable in the harmonious geometry of her works. Botelho claims that Nunez del Prado has a \u201cgenius loci\u201d and distinguishes four periods in her work. The first period is characterized by the musical thematic of her work. The second period is characterized by the use of bidimensional sculpture and a social thematic. The third period is characterized by the tridimensional stone sculpture.  It is also known as the \u2018maternal\u2019 period because of her aymara Madonnas and other depictions of indigenous women.  Finally, the fourth period is the neo-abstract, which has been influenced by Picasso, Archipenko and Milles. \nIn similar fashion Hector Herazo Rojas (1962)  argues that her works is characterized by strength, grace and monumentality He also points out that her works revolve around the thematic of race, myth and tradition. Her sculptures of indigenous motherly figures and mythic animals can attest to this. Pedro Querejazu (1996) coincides with Herazo Rojas on her race thematic and suggest that her sculptures originated within the movement of \u2018native\u2019 realism. According to him, her later her work adopted a modern and international expression which achieved a final stage immersed in the abstractism. This later work focused on the female figure and creatures of the Andes. On this later stage she worked with Amazonian tropical woods, bronze, and stones such as granite, andesite, basalt, onyx and marble.\nOther critics like Eduardo Mendoza Varela (1961), who reviewed her sculptures exhibition shown in the Luis Angel Arango library at the bank of the Republic of Colombia in Bogota Colombia, argues that her work is \u2018miraculous\u2019 and \u2018mysterious\u2019. His critique employs poetic metaphors to emphasize her skills and mastery of the materials in her sculptures. He considers the abstracted and reduced forms as possessing the ability to go beyond just physical representation but capture the spirit of the artist herself. The critic Guillermo Nino de Guzman also refers to her work as \u2018genius\u2019 and a constant force of creative energy in regards to her series \u201cMujeres al Viento\u201d(P\u00e1gina 7, 2014). Finally, her work has inspired poetry verses. The Spanish poet Rafael Alberti has dedicated an homage to her work.\n\n\n== N\u00fa\u00f1ez Del Prado Museum ==\nIn the 1970s Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado established her residence and art studio in what would become the Museum Hose, located in 300 \u00c1ntero Aspillaga Street, right at the center of the El Olivar Forest. This neocolonial style building was conceived in 1926 by the engineer Luis Alayza and Paz Sold\u00e1n and raised by the master builder Enrique Rodrigo, being one of the first buildings in the area. It became the first house in the whole of El Olivar to be declared National Cultural Heritage and in 1984 the house-museum of the N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado Foundation was officially inaugurated in La Paz in honor of Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado's parents.\nThe House Museum governed by the FOUNDATION NU\u00d1EZ DEL PRADO, is a Private Museum that enriches the Bolivian heritage. For decades it was a home and studio to Marina Nunez del Prado, and now it has become the Casa Museo and a treasured place of history and talent to those of Bolivia. The museum contains 1,014 works by del Prado, which constitute the greater repository of her work including sculptures, drawings and sketches by Marina, thus making it the largest existing collection of her works. But within the museum you will not only find the work of Marina, but also that of her sister Nilda, who was a great goldsmith and painter. The museum is filled with their family environment, works of her father, and the collections of Bolivian Silver, Colonial Art, Contemporary Painting, and Handicrafts.\nThe house is surrounded by a garden of sculptures that had changing results affected by the urban modifications of its surroundings. It is composed of two levels being the first one of adobe and the second one of quincha brava. On the first floor there is a small central courtyard with a fused iron fountain. Its fa\u00e7ade is colorful and on the right hand side, it reproduces, on a smaller scale, the front of the famous Palace of the Admiral of the city of Cusco. The workshop of the sculptor Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez, located on the second level, has been considered as the heart of the house and the intervention revolves around it.For a large period of time the situation of the home museum of Marina Nunez del Prado was one of complication. At the time the museum had been closed and forgotten for almost 10 years due to lack of management and support. The closing was due to a break in its infrastructure during the initial construction of the American Tunnel and had remained closed to the public while many people claim the national or municipal government never took care of the situation. There exist many personal accounts of neighbors who had watched the museum remain neglected for years and described its importance to their community and art history. They speak highly of the museum and the works included as well as speak fondly of del Prado as an artist. In 2012 they published a note that restoration of the house would begin and that \nwork was being done to solve the many architectural issues. It was reopened in April 2015 by the San Isidro District Council and the curatorial work made for the selection of the pieces being shown was made by Gustavo Buntinx.\n\n\n== Legacy and death ==\nMarina Nunez del Prado died in Lima, Peru on September 9, 1995, where she had spent the last twenty-five years of her life working. She left behind a legacy that significantly enriched Bolivian art and culture but was also a significant contribution to the practice of sculpture and Latin-American art. In her lifetime, she had traveled and accomplished so much and became as well known as the artist she was inspired by like Picasso or Gabriel Mistral.Her physical legacy is the Museo de Nunez del Prado which was her family home. It now houses over 1000 of her works including drawings and sketches. The museum preserves the work of Nunez del Prado as well as contributions made by her sister who was a gifted goldsmith and painter and her father. Located in the center of the El Olivar Forest, the museum is a National Cultural Heritage site. Admission to the museum is free, but international visitors require personal identification such as a passport. Visits are guided by the curator.\nNunez del Prado\u2019s non-physical legacy far extends beyond the borders of Peru. Her work has significantly impacted the field of sculpture both in Latin America and internationally. Her work has been a great influence in the collective identity of South American art. She has also been a subject in literature like work by the Argentine poet Alfonsina Storni, Uruguayan narrator Juana de Ibarbourou and Spanish poet Raphael Alberti. Since 1930 her work has impacted and been the source of admiration in countries such as Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Germany, USA, Brazil, Spain, Italy, France, Cuba and Mexico.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThomas E.

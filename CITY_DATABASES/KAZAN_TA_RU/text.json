        "wiki": "Kazan (; Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0301\u043d\u044c, IPA: [k\u0250\u02c8zan\u02b2]; Tatar: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. With a population of 1,243,500, it is the sixth most populous city in Russia.\nKazan lies at the confluence of the Volga and Kazanka Rivers in Western Russia, about 715 kilometres (444 mi) east from Moscow. In the Late Middle Ages, Kazan was an important trade and political center within the Golden Horde. In 1438, the city became the capital of the Khanate of Kazan. In 1552, Kazan was captured by Ivan the Terrible and became part of Russia. The city was largely destroyed during Pugachev's Rebellion, but was later rebuilt during the reign of Catherine the Great. In the following centuries, Kazan grew to become a major industrial, cultural and religious center in Russia. Kazan was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nKazan is renowned for its vibrant mix of Oriental and Russian cultures. In 2015, 2.1 million tourists visited Kazan, and 1.5 million tourists visited the Kazan Kremlin, a World Heritage Site. In April 2009, the Russian Patent Office granted Kazan the right to brand itself as the \"Third Capital\" of Russia.  In 2009 it was chosen as the \"sports capital of Russia\" and it still is referred to as such.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name Kazan is uncertain. The most accepted legends derive it from the Bulgar (and also modern Tatar) word qazan, which means 'boiler' or 'cauldron'. Most often appeal to the version of the boiling boiler: the sorcerer advised the Bulgars to build a city where, without any fire, a boiler dug into the ground would boil water. As a result, a similar place was found on the shore of Lake Kaban. One legend claims that the city was named after the river Kazanka, which was named after the son of a Bulgar governor who dropped a copper cauldron into it. Other local legends, including research by the Tatar scholar Shihabeddin Marjani, claim that the city was named for the resemblance of the hill on which it sits to an upturned cauldron.\nQazan/Kazan was a choice name for the male Turkic/Mongol royalty, most notably that of the Ilkhanid Mongol king, Qazan Khan. It is likely that the city was named after a Mongol/Turkic khan by that name when the city was founded or soon thereafter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAccording to the official version adopted today, the city was founded more than 1,000 years ago. The estimated date of the urban settlement on the site of Kazan is 1004\u20131005 AD. The reason for this dating was found during excavations in the Kazan Kremlin - a Czech coin, dated by the Board of St. Wenceslaus (presumably, coinage 929\u2013930 years) and the earliest Czech coin, the remains of masonry and wooden city fence, handicrafts and utensils (Hungarian type lining, women's beads, etc.), as well as other artifacts with less obvious dating. According to official statements, experts from 20 cities of Russia and 22 countries of the world were involved in the study of findings related to the age of Kazan.Kazan was a border post between Volga Bulgaria and two Finno-Ugric peoples\u2014the Mari and Udmurt. Another vexatious question is where the citadel was built originally. Archaeological explorations have produced evidence of urban settlement in three parts of the modern city: in the Kremlin; in Bi\u015fbalta at the site of the modern Zilantaw monastery; and near the Qaban lake. The oldest of these seems to be the Kremlin.\nAfter the Mongols ravaged the Bol\u011far and Bil\u00e4r territories in the 13th century, the surviving Bulgars recovered in numbers and a small number of Kipchaks were assimilated from which they adopted their language (the so-called Bulgarism), or Kipchaks and Bulgars mixed to create a modern Kazan-Tatar population. Some Tatars also went to Lithuania, brought by Vytautas the great. Kazan became the center of the Principality, which was dependent on The Golden Horde. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Kazan was growing, becoming an important trade and political center within The Golden Horde. The growth of the city was also promoted by the successful geographical location at the intersection of major trade routes connecting East and West. During the same period, the minting of currency began with the indication of the place of minting\u2014\"Bulgar al-Jadid\", that is, a New Bulgar.\nIn 1438, the Bulgar fortress Kazan (ISKE-Kazan) was captured by the ousted Golden Horde Khan Ulugh Muhammad, who killed the local Prince Swan and moved the fortress to a modern place (according to Russian Chronicles). The city became the capital of the Kazan Khanate. The city Bazaar, Ta\u015f Ayaq (stone foot) has become the most important shopping center in the region, especially for furniture. Handicraft production also flourished, as the city gained a reputation for its leather and gold products, as well as the wealth of its palaces and mosques. \nKazan had trade relations with Moscow, Crimea, Turkey and other regions.\n\n\n=== Russian Tsardom period ===\n\nAs a result of the Siege of Kazan in 1552, Tsar Ivan the Terrible conquered the city and massacred the majority of the population. During the subsequent governorship of Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky, most of the Kazan's Tatar residents were forcibly Christianized or deported, the Kerashen Tatars. Mosques and palaces were ruined. The surviving Tatar population was moved to a place 50 kilometers (31 mi) away from the city and this place was forcibly settled by Russian farmers and soldiers. Tatars in the Russian service were settled in the Tatar Bist\u00e4se settlement near the city's wall. Later Tatar merchants and handicraft masters also settled there. During this period, Kazan was largely destroyed as a result of several great fires. After one of them in 1579, the icon Our Lady of Kazan was discovered in the city.\nIn the early 17th century, at the beginning of the Time of Troubles in Russia, the Tsardom of Kazan declared independence under the leadership of voyvoda Nikanor Shulgin with the help of the Russian population, but this independence was suppressed by Kuzma Minin in 1612.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire period ===\n\nIn 1708, the Tsardom of Kazan was abolished, and Kazan became the seat of Kazan Governorate. After Peter the Great's visit, the city became a center of shipbuilding for the Caspian fleet. The major Russian poet Gavrila Derzhavin was born in Kazan in 1743, the son of a poor country squire of Tatar ancestry though himself having a thoroughly Russian identity.\nBefore the building of modern dams, low-lying areas were regularly flooded in April and May. Kazan suffered major fires in 1595, 1672, 1694, 1742, 1749, 1757 1744, 1815 and 1842.\nKazan was largely destroyed in 1774 as a result of the Pugachev revolt (1774\u20131776), an uprising by border troops and peasants led by the Don Cossack ataman (Captain) Yemelyan Pugachev, but the city, formerly largely of timber construction, was soon afterwards rebuilt, using stone and according to a grid pattern plan, during the reign of Catherine the Great. Catherine also decreed that mosques could again be built in Kazan, the first being Marjani Mosque.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century Kazan State University and printing press were founded by Alexander I. It became an important center for Oriental Studies in Russia. The Qur'an was first printed in Kazan in 1801. Kazan became an industrial center and peasants migrated there to join its industrial workforce. In 1875, a horse tramway appeared; 1899 saw the installation of a tramway. After the Russian Revolution of 1905, Tatars were allowed to revive Kazan as a Tatar cultural center. The first Tatar theater and the first Tatar newspaper appeared.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nIn 1917, Kazan became one of the revolution centers. In 1918, Kazan was the capital of the Idel-Ural State, which was suppressed by the Bolshevist government. In the Kazan Operation of August 1918, it was briefly occupied by Czechoslovak Legions. In 1920, Kazan became the center of Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In the 1920s and 1930s, most of the city's mosques and churches were destroyed, as occurred elsewhere in the USSR. \nAfter the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) until 1933, the German and the Russian army operated together the Kama tank school in Kazan.\nDuring World War II, many industrial plants and factories to the west were relocated in Kazan, making the city a center of the military industry, producing tanks and planes. After the war Kazan consolidated as an industrial and scientific center. In 1979, the city's population reached one million.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\nIn the late 1980s and in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazan again became the center of Tatar culture and identity, and separatist tendencies intensified. With the return of capitalism, Kazan became one of the most important centers of the Russian Federation. The city went from 10th to 8th position in population ranking of Russian cities. In the early 2000s, the city earned the right to host both the 2013 Summer Universiade and 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n==== Millennium of Kazan ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSince 2000, the city has been undergoing a total renovation. The historical center\u2014including the Kremlin\u2014has been rebuilt, however a large number of the city's historical districts were completely demolished in the renovation. Kazan celebrated its millennium in 2005, after a city-organized historical commission settled on 1005 as the official year of the city's founding. During the millennium celebrations, one of the largest mosque in Russia, Qolsharif, was dedicated in the Kazan Kremlin, the holiest copy of Our Lady of Kazan was returned to the city, the Millennium Bridge was inaugurated that year, and the Kazan Metro began operation. The government of the Russian Federation released the Medal \"In Commemoration of the 1000th Anniversary of Kazan\".\nIn 2010, for the preparations to the 2013 Universiade, Kazan began even more renovation by modernizing its airport, fixing the streets, enhancing public transport, and adopting Russian, English, and Tatar languages in all transportation, large stores, and shopping centers.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe historical symbol of Kazan is the mythical dragon-like creature Zilant, often mentioned in legends. For example, when numerous snakes and reptiles severely hampered the development of the city, the hunters went in search of the King of snakes and defeated him, according to another version, the residents of the city bought off the giant snake with gold, after which all the snakes left the city. Another legend says that the giant dragon-like serpent always guarded the Khan's treasures, and that it still protects the hidden wealth before the capture of the city in the secret caves. Historically, it is true that snakes were once numerous in the Kazan region, but then their number has decreased dramatically. The first official coat of arms of Kazan was approved on 18 October 1781 and was described as \"black snake under the crown of gold, Kazan, red wings, white field\". In 1926, the country introduced a ban on such heraldry. In the 1980s, the coat of arms of Kazan began to reappear, and in the 1990s Kazan Zilant in various styles began to appear in print media. Modern graphics of the emblem and flag appeared in 2005\u2014in a silver field on the green earth a black dragon with red wings and tongue, with gold paws, claws and eyes, topped with a gold crown. The shield is crowned with a Kazan cap. According to the traditions of heraldry, the dragon symbolizes power, wisdom and invincibility, the earth\u2014life and wealth, the crown-development, and the cap above the shield-the capital of the city.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nKazan is the capital of the republic.

As a result of its far inland position, summers are extremely warm for its latitude and winters are quite cold compared to areas further west in Europe.The warmest month is July with daily mean temperature near 20.2 \u00b0C (68.4 \u00b0F), and the coldest month is January, with a daily mean of \u221210.4 \u00b0C (13.3 \u00b0F).The city set its two hottest days on record during the 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves.

Major monuments in the Kremlin are the five-domed, six-columned Annunciation Cathedral (1561\u201362) and the mysterious, formerly leaning S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower, named after the last queen of Kazan and regarded as the city's most conspicuous landmark.\nAlso of interest are the towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later reconstructed; the Qol-\u015earif Mosque, which has been rebuilt inside the citadel; remains of the Saviour Monastery (a 16th-century cathedral demolished by the Bolsheviks) with the Spasskaya Tower; and the Governor's House (1843\u201353), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of Tatarstan.\nNext door, the ornate baroque Sts-Peter-and-Paul's Cathedral on Qawi Nacmi Street and Marcani Mosque on Qayum Nasiri Street date back to the 18th century.\n\n\n==== Towers ====\nThe Spasskaya Tower was built in two floors by 16th century Pskov architects Ivan Shiryai and Postnik Yakovlev. From the inside, the northern side of the fortress to the Spasskaya Tower adjoined the gate to Spasskaya Church, which has now merged with the tower. The typical Pskovian architectural elements of the facade face the main street of the Kremlin. At the end of the 17th century, instead of three tiers, the tower was built with two brick eight-sided tiers with a brick roof, getting its present, familiar appearance. Until 1917, the tower was crowned with the double-headed coat of arms of the Russian state. In the 18th century, a ringing clock was installed in the upper tier, and even earlier a large bell was moved from a small belfry (now lost, located on the castle wall on the left side of the tower). Until the middle of the 19th century, there was a moat with a stone bridge in front of the tower.\nThe South-Western Tower was built simultaneously with the Spasskaya tower by Pskov masters and is a classic example of the Pskov style of defensive structures.\nThe name of the Transfiguration Tower comes from the Transfiguration Monastery of the Savior, which was fenced from the north-west. The tower was also built by Pskov architects Postnik and Barma, but it was significantly rebuilt later, as it has strong traces of the architectural influence of the Moscow defensive architecture. The territory from the Transfiguration Tower to the Spasskaya pass was added to the old Khan's fortress by Pskov masters.\nThere are unnamed round brick towers, presumably built by Moscow architects in the 17th century.\nThe Tainitskaya Tower was built in its present form in the 1550s by Postnik Yakovlev. It was named after a secret source from which it was possible to take water during a siege. The entrance to the tower is in the form of a \"knee\", which increased the defense of the Kremlin. It replaced a tower from the time of the khanate, Nur Ali (in Russian transcription Muraleeva). The 22-year-old Tsar Ivan the Terrible entered the conquered city through the Nur Ali tower.\nThe North-Eastern Round Tower was demolished after the Pugachev's assault.\nThe Consistor Tower was built in brick by Moscow architects in the 17th century, its name was given in the 18th century from the Spiritual Consistory located near the tower in the Kremlin. Near the tower, archaeological excavations revealed the so-called Tezitsky (Arabic for \"merchant\") Moat, which went from the Consistor Tower to the Transfiguration. Archaeologist N. Kalinin and a number of scientists believed that the moat was the southern border of the Khan's fortress.\nThe Southeast Round Tower is an example of Pskov architecture of the 16th century.\n\n\n=== Bist\u00e4, or Posad ===\nCentral Kazan is divided into two districts by the Bolaq canal and Lake Qaban. The first district (Qazan Bist\u00e4se or Kazanskiy Posad), historically Russian, is situated on the hill, the second (\u0130ske Tatar Bist\u00e4se or Staro-Tatarskaya Sloboda), historically Tatar, is situated between the Bolaq and the Volga. Mosques, such as Nurullah, Soltan, Bornay, Apanay, \u00c4cem, M\u00e4rcani, \u0130ske Ta\u015f, Z\u00e4\u00f1g\u00e4r are in the Tatar district. Churches, such as Blagoveschenskaya, Varvarinskaya, Nikol'skaya, Tikhvinskaya, are mostly in the Russian part of the city. The main city-centre streets are Bauman, Kremlyovskaya, Dzerzhinsky, Tuqay, Pu\u015fkin, Butlerov, Gorkiy, Karl Marx and M\u00e4rcani.\nAn old legend says that in 1552, before the Russian invasion, wealthy Tatars (baylar) hid gold and silver in Lake Qaban.\n\n\n=== Wooden Kazan ===\nIn the beginning of the 1900s most of Central Kazan was covered by wooden buildings, usually consisting of two floors. There was a historical environment of Kazan citizens, but not the best place to live in. During the Republican program \"The liquidation of ramshackle apartments\" most of them (unlike other Russian cities), especially in Central Kazan, where the land is not cheap, were destroyed and their population was moved to new areas at the suburb of the city (Azino, Azino-2, Quartal 39). Nearly 100,000 citizens resettled by this programme.\n\n\n=== Other major buildings ===\nAnother significant building in central Kazan is the former \"Smolentzev and Shmelev\" tea house and hotel, now the Shalyapin Palace Hotel. It is located at 7/80 Universitetskaya Street, at the corner of Universitetskaya and Bauman. A major landmark of late-19th and early-20th century commercial architecture, it consists of two portions. The original portion, built for a merchant named Usmanov in the 1860s, was bought by the inter-related families of Efim Smolentzev and Pavel and Nikolai Shmelev in 1899. They operated a store selling, among other things, tea. In 1910, the Smolentevs and Shmelevs constructed another portion, designed by architect Vasili Trifonov, and operated a hotel there. After the Russian Revolution, the building eventually became the Hotel Soviet and after 2000 it was heavily renovated to reopen as the Shalyapin Palace Hotel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Education and science ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nPrimary and secondary education system of Kazan includes:\n\n282 nurseries, most of which are municipal\n178 schools, 2 of which are private\n28 vocational technical schools\n15 colleges\n10 special collegesThere are also 49 music schools, 43 sports school, and 10 fine-arts schools, including the Kazan Art School founded in 1895.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nThere are 44 institutes of higher education in Kazan, including 19 branches of universities from other cities.

        "wiki": "The Kul Sharif Mosque (Tatar: \u041a\u043e\u043b \u0428\u04d9\u0440\u0438\u0444 \u043c\u04d9\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435; Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442\u044c \u041a\u0443\u043b-\u0428\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0444, romanized: Mechet' Kul-Sharif) located in Kazan Kremlin, was reputed to be \u2013 at the time of its construction \u2013 one of the largest mosques in Russia, and in Europe outside of Istanbul.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally, the mosque was built in the Kazan Kremlin in the 16th century. It was named after Kul Sharif, who was a religious scholar who served there. Kul Sharif died with his numerous students while defending Kazan from Russian forces in 1552. It is believed that the building featured minarets, both in the form of cupolas and tents. Its design was traditional for Volga Bulgaria, although elements of early Renaissance and Ottoman architecture could have been used as well. In 1552, during the Siege of Kazan it was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible.\n\nTatar scholars speculate as to whether some elements of Kul Sharif Mosque can be seen in Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow (8 domes with a central cupola). Since 1996, the mosque has been rebuilt in the Kazan Kremlin, although its look is decisively modern. Its inauguration on July 24, 2005, marked the beginning of celebrations dedicated to the Millennium of Kazan. It can accommodate 6,000 worshipers.\nSeveral countries contributed to the fund that was set up to rebuild Kul Sharif Mosque, namely Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Nowadays the mosque predominantly serves as a museum of Islam. At the same time during the major Muslim celebrations thousands of people gather there to pray.\nThe Kul Sharif complex was envisioned to be an important cornerstone of Kazan's architectural landscape. Besides the main mosque building it includes a library, publishing house and Imam's office.\n\n\n== Ivan IV Vasilyevich ==\nIvan IV Vasilyevich, who was also known as Ivan the Terrible, was the prince of Russia from 1533 until 1584. During Ivan's ruling, Russia endured several hardships and changes towards their country. Ivan took great pride in being the tsar of Russia. He believed no one was his equal and if one were to defy him, it was as if they were betraying God himself. His reign was filled with complete terror as he did everything possible to rebuild Russia since he believed he was only pleasing God. Ivan's reign led to the destruction of several buildings, including Kul Sharif Mosque, which was later rebuilt and completed in 2005.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nKinossian, Nadir (July 2012). \"Post-Socialist Transition and Remaking the City: Political Construction of Heritage in Tatarstan\".

It was built at the behest of Ivan the Terrible on the ruins of the former castle of Kazan khans. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nThe Kazan Kremlin includes many old buildings, the oldest of which is the Annunciation Cathedral (1554\u201462), the only 16th-century Russian church to have six piers and five apses. Like many of Kazan's buildings of the period, it is constructed of local pale sandstone rather than of brick. The renowned Pskov architects Postnik Yakovlev and Ivan Shirjay (called Barma) were invited by the Tzar to rebuild the Kazan Kremlin in stone. The cathedral bell tower was erected in five tiers at the urging of Ivan the Terrible and was scored to resemble the Ivan the Great Belltower in Moscow, but was pulled down by the Soviets in 1930.\nThe most conspicuous landmark of the Kazan Kremlin is the leaning S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower, which probably goes back to the reign of Peter the Great. A well-known legend connects the tower with the last queen of the Khanate of Kazan. Another recognizable architectural feature is the Spasskaya Tower, which anchors the southern end of the Kremlin and serves as the main entrance to the Kremlin. \nThe Spasskaya Tower is named after the Spassky Monastery, which used to be located nearby. Among the monastery's buildings were the Church of St. Nicholas (1560s, four piers) and the Cathedral of the Saviour's Transfiguration (1590s, six piers). They were destroyed by the Communists during Joseph Stalin's rule.\nAlso of interest are snow-white towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later renovated; the Qol-\u015e\u00e4rif mosque, recently rebuilt inside the citadel; and the Governor's House (1843\u201453), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan. The Palace is believed to be located on the site of a former Khan's palace. Tucked between Presidential Palace and S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower is the palace church built on the foundation of a medieval mosque.\nThe Northern wall of the Kremlin contains another gated tower, Secret Tower, so named because it used to house a secret water supply well. This tower allows pedestrian access to the Kremlin, but vehicle access is restricted to emergencies only.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Recent events ==\n\nThe opening of one of the biggest mosques in Europe, the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif Mosque, was held in Kazan on June 24, 2005. Roughly 17,000 people gathered for the celebration. Delegations from forty countries attended the event. The facility was reconstructed on the site where presumably Kazan Khanate's principal mosque had been standing before 1552. Speaking at the ceremony, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaeymiev said \"the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif mosque is a new symbol of Kazan and Tatarstan... a bridge connecting... our past and future.\" \nThe decree on restoring the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif mosque (1995) also ordered the restoration of the Annunciation Cathedral in the Kazan Kremlin which had been taken away from Orthodox Christians after the Russian Revolution. On July 21, 2005, the feast day of the holy icon \"Theotokos of Kazan\", in the presence of the crowd of 10,000 pilgrims, Patriarch Alexius II and Mintimer Shaeymiev placed at the newly restored Annunciation Cathedral the holiest copy of the long-lost icon, which had been returned to Russia in 2004 by Pope John Paul II shortly before his death.\nIn 2005 the first stage of the Kazan Metro also included a station named Kremlyovskaya (or Kreml in Tatar), whose exits are right next to the Kremlin.\n\n\n== Views ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKazan Kremlin State Museum and Historical Park (official site) (in English)\nWorld Heritage Patrimony\nPictures of Kazan Kremlin",

It is the oldest acting mosque in Tatarstan and it was the only mosque in Kazan that escaped closure during the Soviet period.  \nThe mosque was built in traditions of the Tatar medieval architecture combined with provincial baroque style, and it represents a typical Tatar mosque. It is believed that the architect was Vasily Kaftyrev. The mosque is situated in the Old Tatar Quarter (\u0130ske Tatar Bist\u00e4se) of Kazan at the bank of the lake Qaban.\nM\u00e4rcani Mosque is two-storied and has two halls. The interior is designed in The Petersburg Baroque style. In 1861 merchant \u0130. \u011e. Yun\u0131sov donated the addition of stairs, and in 1863 he donated the extension of mihrab and the breaching of new window. In that period the mosque was called Yun\u0131sovs' mosque after his family. In 1885 merchant Z. \u011eosmanov donated the renovation of the minaret. In 1887 merchants W. \u011eizz\u00e4tullin and M. W\u00e4li\u015fin added the tracery balcony to the minaret. \nThe mosque is currently named after Tatar scholar \u015eihabetdin M\u00e4rcani who worked there as imam since 1850.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIslam in Tatarstan\nIslam in Russia\nList of mosques in Russia\n\n\n== References ==\n\"M\u00e4rcani m\u00e4\u00e7ete\".

        "wiki": "Elia Kazan (; born Elias Kazantzoglou (Greek: \u0397\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03cc\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5); September 7, 1909 \u2013 September 28, 2003) was a Greek-American director, producer, writer and actor, described by The New York Times as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history\".He was born in Istanbul, to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including City for Conquest (1940).His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was Gentleman's Agreement (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by Pinky, one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received twelve Oscar nominations, winning four, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's East of Eden, which introduced James Dean to movie audiences.\nA turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong.\" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses.\" Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous.\" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film A Letter to Elia as a personal tribute to Kazan.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nElia Kazan was born in the Fener district of Istanbul, to Cappadocian Greek parents originally from Kayseri in Anatolia. He arrived with his parents, George and Athena Kazantzoglou (n\u00e9e Shishmanoglou), to the United States on 8 July 1913. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Elia Kazantzoglou. His maternal grandfather was Isaak Shishmanoglou. Elia's brother, Avraam, was born in Berlin and later became a psychiatrist.Kazan was raised in the Greek Orthodox religion and attended Greek Orthodox services every Sunday, where he had to stand for several hours with his father. His mother read the Bible but did not go to church. When Kazan was about eight years old, the family moved to New Rochelle, New York, and his father sent him to a Roman Catholic catechism school because there was no Orthodox church nearby.\n\nAs a young boy, he was remembered as being shy, and his college classmates described him as more of a loner. Much of his early life was portrayed in his autobiographical book, America America, which he made into a film in 1963. In it, he describes his family as \"alienated\" from both their parents' Greek Orthodox values and from those of mainstream America. His mother's family were cotton merchants who imported cotton from England and sold it wholesale.  His father had become a rug merchant after emigrating to the United States and expected that his son would go into the same business.After attending public schools through high school, Kazan enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he helped pay his way by waiting tables and washing dishes; he still graduated cum laude. He also worked as a bartender at various fraternities, but never joined one. While a student at Williams, he earned the nickname \"Gadg,\" for Gadget, because, he said, \"I was small, compact, and handy to have around.\" The nickname was eventually taken up by his stage and film stars.\nIn America America he tells how, and why, his family left Turkey and moved to America. Kazan notes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that \"it's all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to Istanbul ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances ... It's also true that he lost the money on the way, and when he got there he swept rugs in a little store.\"Kazan notes some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film. He writes \"I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas.\" To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan's uncle Avraam kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:\n\nI hesitated about that for a long time. A lot of people, who don't understand how desperate people can get, advised me to cut it. When I am accused of being excessive by the critics, they're talking about moments like that. But I wouldn't take it out for the world. It actually happened. Believe me, if a Turk could get out of Turkey and come here, even now, he would kiss the ground. To oppressed people, America is still a dream.\nBefore undertaking the film, Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family's background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a \"deeper question: 'Why America? What were you hoping for?'\" His mother gave him the answer, however: \"A.E. brought us here.\" Kazan states that \"A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey. At twenty-eight, somehow\u2014this was the wonder\u2014he made his way to New York. He sent home money and in time brought my father over. Father sent for my mother and my baby brother and me when I was four.\nKazan writes of the movie, \"It's my favorite of all the films I've made; the first film that was entirely mine.\"\n\n\n== Stage career ==\n\n\n=== Group Theatre ===\n\nIn 1932, after spending two years at the Yale University School of Drama, he moved to New York City to become a professional stage actor. He continued his professional studies at the Juilliard School where he studied singing with Lucia Dunham. His first opportunity came with a small group of actors engaged in presenting plays containing \"social commentary\". They were called the Group Theatre, which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages. After struggling to be accepted by them, he discovered his first strong sense of self in America within the \"family of the Group Theatre, and more loosely in the radical social and cultural movements of the time,\" writes film author Joanna E. Rapf.In Kazan's autobiography, he writes of the \"lasting impact on him of the Group,\" noting in particular, Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman as \"father figures\", along with his close friendship with playwright Clifford Odets. Kazan, during an interview with Michel Ciment, describes the Group:\n\nThe Group was the best thing professionally that ever happened to me. I met two wonderful men. Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman, both of whom were around thirty years old. They were magnetic, fearless leaders. During the summer I was an apprentice, they were entertaining in a Jewish summer camp ... At the end of the summer they said to me: \"You may have talent for something, but it's certainly not acting.\"Kazan, in his autobiography, also describes Strasberg as a vital leader of the group:\n\nHe carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home ... [H]e was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them permanent.Kazan's first national success came as a New York theatrical director. Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Group's most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by Clifford Odets, Waiting for Lefty, and his performance was called \"dynamic,\" leading some to describe him as the \"proletarian thunderbolt.\"Among the themes that would run through all of his work were \"personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice\", writes film critic William Baer. Other critics have likewise noted his \"strong commitment to the social and social psychological\u2014rather than the purely political\u2014implications of drama\".By the mid-1930s, when he was 26, he began directing a number of the Group Theatre's plays, including Robert Ardrey's well-known play Thunder Rock. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by Thornton Wilder, The Skin of Our Teeth, starring Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a Pulitzer Prize. Kazan won the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller, and then directed A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams, both of which were also successful. Kazan's wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a \"prize that launched his career.\"The Group Theatre's summer rehearsal headquarters was at Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, during the 1930s and early 1940s. Along with Kazan were numerous other artists: Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Luise Rainer, Frances Farmer, Will Geer, Howard Da Silva, Clifford Odets, Lee J. Cobb and Irwin Shaw.\n\n\n=== Actors Studio ===\nIn 1947, he founded the Actors Studio, a non-profit workshop, with actors Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford. In 1951, Lee Strasberg became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the \"Method\" to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of Konstantin Stanislavski's teachings. The \"Method\" school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.\nAmong Strasberg's students were Montgomery Clift, Mildred Dunnock, Julie Harris, Karl Malden, Patricia Neal, Maureen Stapleton, Eli Wallach, and James Whitmore. \nKazan directed two of the Studio's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Karl Malden and Marlon Brando, in the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nThough at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films, but his first feature film was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed Gentleman's Agreement, where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in America, antisemitism, for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1949 he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed Pinky, which dealt with issues of racism in America, and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.\nIn 1947, he directed the courtroom drama Boomerang!, and in 1950 he directed Panic in the Streets, starring Richard Widmark, in a thriller shot on the streets of New Orleans. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in \"energizing\" the action scenes. He won the Venice Film Festival International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that Zero Mostel also act in the film, despite Mostel being \"blacklisted\" as a result of HUAC testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:\n\nEach director has a favorite in his cast, ... my favorite this time was Zero Mostel ... I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I'd ever met ... I constantly sought his company ... He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the \"industry's\" blacklist ... For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.\nIn 1951, after introducing and directing Marlon Brando and Karl Malden in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, A Streetcar Named Desire, which won 4 Oscars, being nominated for 12.\nDespite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater, though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, but he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:\n\nOn \"Streetcar\" we worked very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I actually did was to make the set smaller. As the story progressed ... the set got smaller and smaller.Kazan's next film was Viva Zapata! (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his \"first real film\" because of those factors.In 1954 he again used Brando as a star in On the Waterfront.  As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York's longshoremen's union. It too was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, and won 8, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, for Marlon Brando.\nOn the Waterfront was also the screen debut for Eva Marie Saint, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:\n\nI ended up crying. Crying and laughing ... I mean there was such an attraction there ... That smile of his ... He was very tender and funny ... And Kazan, in his genius, saw the chemistry there.\nLife magazine described On the Waterfront as the \"most brutal movie of the year\" but with \"the year's tenderest love scenes,\" and stating that Saint was a \"new discovery\" in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in On the Waterfront that she \"starts her real trip to fame.\"The film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer Leonard Bernstein.\n\nAfter the success of On the Waterfront, he went on to direct another screen adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel, East of Eden (1955). As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, James Dean. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag. The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), directed by Kazan's friend Nicholas Ray, and then Giant (1956), directed by George Stevens.\nAuthor Douglas Rathgeb describes the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he \"kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.\" As a result, Kazan was forced to \"baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers,\" so he wouldn't run away during production. Co-star Julie Harris worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that \"his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears.\"\nDean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director Nicholas Ray to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in Rebel Without a Cause. Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen; but it didn't seem possible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. \"Dean himself did not seem to believe it,\" notes Rathgeb. \"He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.\"The film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car outside of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was East of Eden.\nIn 1961, he introduced Warren Beatty in his first screen appearance with a starring role in Splendor in the Grass (1961), with Natalie Wood; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author Peter Biskind points out that Kazan \"was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.\" Biskind notes also that they \"were wildly dissimilar\u2014mentor vs. prot\u00e9g\u00e9, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.\"  Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:\n\nWarren\u2014it was obvious the first time I saw him\u2014wanted it all and wanted it his way. Why not? He had the energy, a very keen intelligence, and more chutzpah than any Jew I've ever known. Even more than me. Bright as they come, intrepid, and with that thing all women secretly respect: complete confidence in his sexual powers, confidence so great that he never had to advertise himself, even by hints.Biskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: \"The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HUAC. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something\u2014why did you name all those names?'\"Beatty recalled the episode: \"In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.\" Biskind describes how \"Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.\" Beatty, years later, during a Kennedy Center tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan \"had given him the most important break in his career.\"Beatty's costar, Natalie Wood, was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer Suzanne Finstad notes that a \"turning point\" in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film A Streetcar Named Desire: \"She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie.\" In 1961, after a \"series of bad films, her career was already in decline,\" notes Rathgeb. Kazan writes that the \"sages\" of the film community declared her as \"washed up\" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:\n\nWhen I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J., I said to myself. I liked Bob Wagner, I still do.Kazan cast her as the female lead in Splendor in the Grass, and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, \"working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on Splendor.\" She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of \"Kazan's wizardry ...  produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.\"Actor Gary Lockwood, who also acted in the film, felt that \"Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.\" Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). \"It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,\" writes Kazan. \"And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.\"\n\n\n=== Screenwriters ===\nKazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Inge; in film, he worked again with Willams (A Streetcar Named Desire and Baby Doll), Inge (Splendor in the Grass), Budd Schulberg (On the Waterfront and A Face in the Crowd), John Steinbeck (Viva Zapata!), and Harold Pinter (The Last Tycoon). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, \"he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.\" In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond, was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.Williams became one of Kazan's closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of \"creative slumps\" by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, \"Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.\"Among Kazan's other films were Panic in the Streets (1950), East of Eden (1955), Baby Doll (1956), Wild River (1960), and The Last Tycoon (1976).\n\n\n== Literary career ==\nIn between his directing work he wrote four best-selling novels, including America America and The Arrangement, both of which tell the story of Kazan's Greek immigrant ancestors. Both novels were later made into films.\n\n\n== Directing style ==\n\n\n=== Preference for unknown actors ===\nKazan strove for \"cinematic realism,\" a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict \"social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity.\" He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie's ultimate success or failure. As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as Lee Remick, Jo Van Fleet, Warren Beatty, Andy Griffith, James Dean, and Jack Palance, their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer George Stevens, Jr. that he felt that \"big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits ... they're not pliable anymore.\" Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:\nNow what I try to do is get to know them very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human material is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.Kazan goes on to describe how he got to understand James Dean, as an example:\n\nWhen I met him he said, \"I'll take you for a ride on my motorbike ...\" It was his way of communicating with me, saying \"I hope you like me, ...\" I thought he was an extreme grotesque of a boy, a twisted boy. As I got to know his father, as I got to know about his family, I learned that he had been, in fact, twisted by the denial of love ... I went to Jack Warner and told him I wanted to use an absolutely unknown boy. Jack was a crapshooter of the first order, and said, \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\n=== Topics of personal and social realism ===\nKazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:\n\nI don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life. I start with an instinct. With East of Eden ... it's really the story of my father and me, and I didn't realize it for a long time ... In some subtle or not-so-subtle way, every film is autobiographical. A thing in my life is expressed by the essence of the film. Then I know it experientially, not just mentally. I've got to feel that it's in some way about me, some way about my struggles, some way about my pain, my hopes.Film historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on \"reality\", although his style was not defined as \"naturalistic.\" She adds: \"He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.\" Kazan states that \"unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him.\"In his later years he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a\n\"collective art,\" as he once believed:\n\nTo be successful it should express the vision, the conviction, and the insistent presence of one person.Film author Peter Biskind described Kazan's career as \"fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work.\" Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:\n\nI don't think basically I'm a political animal. I think I'm a self-centered animal ... I think what I was concerned about all my life was to say something artistically that was uniquely my own.Nonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, written by screenwriter Budd Schulberg, which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.\" Another political film was A Face in the Crowd (1957). His protagonist, played by Andy Griffith (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn \"of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation.\" Kazan states, \"Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package.\"\n\n\n=== Use of \"Method\" acting ===\nAs a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of \"Method\" actors, especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, \"I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance including so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends ... The director is a desperate beast! ... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.\" Actor Robert De Niro called him a \"master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting.\"Kazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:\n\nI don't have great range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The classics are beyond me ... I am a mediocre director except when a play or film touches a part of my life's experience ... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors ... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.He explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:\n\nWhen I talk to the actors they begin to give me ideas, and I grab them because the ideas they give me turn them on. I want the breath of life from them rather than the mechanical fulfillment of the movement which I asked for ... I love actors. I used to be an actor for eight years, so I do appreciate their job.Kazan, however, held strong ideas about the scenes and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in Baby Doll, for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker, he privately asked Wallach, \"Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?\" Wallach writes, \"I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered ... 'No.'\" Kazan replies, \"Good idea, play it that way.\" Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:\n\nWhat is erotic about sex to me is the seduction, not the act ... The scene on the swings (Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker) in Baby Doll is my exact idea of what eroticism in films should be.\n\n\n=== Being an \"actor's director\" ===\nJoanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director Nicholas Ray considered him \"the best actor's director the United States has ever produced.\" Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that \"he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method ... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism.\"Among the actors who describe Kazan as an important influence in their career were Patricia Neal, who co-starred with Andy Griffith in A Face in the Crowd (1957): \"He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.\" Anthony Franciosa, a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:\n\nHe would always say, 'Let me see what you can do. Let me see it. Don't talk to me about it.' You felt that you had a man who was completely on your side\u2014no qualms about anything you did. He gave you a tremendous sense of confidence ... He never made me feel as though I was acting for the camera. Many times, I never even knew where the camera was.However, in order to get quality acting from Andy Griffith, in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls \"an astonishing movie debut,\" Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: \"I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.\"Actress Terry Moore calls Kazan her \"best friend,\" and notes that \"he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life.\" \"He would find out if your life was like the character,\" says Carroll Baker, star of Baby Doll, \"he was the best director with actors.\"Kazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, The Last Tycoon (1976). He remembers that Robert De Niro, the star of the film, \"would do almost anything to succeed,\" and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro \"is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.\"The powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal character traits.  Although he didn't know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, \"Bobby is more meticulous ... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.\" Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film. Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that \"for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather, part II, ... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest.\"Marlon Brando, in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:\n\nI have worked with many movie directors\u2014some good, some fair, some terrible. Kazan was the best actors' director by far of any I've worked for ... the only one who ever really stimulated me, got into a part with me and virtually acted it with me ... he chose good actors, encouraged them to improvise, and then improvised on the improvisation ... He gave his cast freedom and ... was always emotionally involved in the process and his instincts were perfect ... I've never seen a director who became as deeply and emotionally involved in a scene as Gadg ... he got so wrought up that he started chewing on his hat.He was an arch-manipulator of actors' feelings, and he was extraordinarily talented; perhaps we will never see his like again.\n\n\n== HUAC testimony ==\n\nKazan testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) in 1952, during the postwar era that journalist Michael Mills, calls \"arguably the most controversial period in Hollywood history.\" When Kazan was in his mid-20s, during the Depression years 1934 to 1936, he had been a member of the American Communist Party in New York, for a year and a half.\nIn April 1952, the Committee called on Kazan, under oath, to identify Communists from that period 16 years earlier. Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former Group Theatre members who he said had been Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller, who later married Lee Strasberg. He testified that Odets quit the party at the same time that he did. All the persons named were already known to HUAC, however. The move cost Kazan many friends within the film industry, including playwright Arthur Miller.Kazan would later write in his autobiography of the \"warrior pleasure at withstanding his 'enemies.\"\nWhen Kazan received an Honorary Academy Award in 1999, the audience was noticeably divided in their reaction, with some including Nick Nolte, Ed Harris, Ian McKellen, and Amy Madigan refusing to applaud, and many others, such as actors Kathy Bates, Meryl Streep, Karl Malden, and Warren Beatty, and producer George Stevens, Jr. standing and applauding. Stevens speculates on why he, Beatty, and many others in the audience chose to stand and applaud:\n\nI never discussed it with Warren, but I believe we were both standing for the same reason\u2014out of regard for the creativity, the stamina and the many fierce battles and lonely nights that had gone into the man's twenty motion pictures.Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan agreed, writing \"The only criterion for an award like this is the work\". Kazan was already \"denied accolades\" from the American Film Institute, and other film critics' associations. According to Mills, \"It's time for the Academy to recognize this genius,\" adding that \"We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour.\" In response, former vice president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Joseph McBride, claimed that an honorary award recognizes \"the totality of what he represents, and Kazan's career, post 1952, was built on the ruin of other people's careers.\"In later interviews, Kazan explained some of the early events that made him decide to become a friendly witness, most notably in relation to the Group Theatre, which he called his first \"family,\" and the \"best thing professionally\" that ever happened to him:\n\nThe Group Theatre said that we shouldn't be committed to any fixed political program set by other people outside the organization. I was behaving treacherously to the Group when I met downtown at CP [Communist Party] headquarters, to decide among the Communists what we should do in the Group, and then come back and present a united front, pretending we had not been in caucus ...\nI was tried by the Party and that was one of the reasons I became so embittered later. The trial was on the issue of my refusal to follow instructions, that we should strike in the Group Theatre, and insist that the membership have control of its organization. I said it was an artistic organization, and I backed up Clurman and Strasberg who were not Communists ... The trial left an indelible impression on me ... Everybody else voted against me and they stigmatized me and condemned my acts and attitude. They were asking for confession and self-humbling. I went home that night and told my wife \"I am resigning.\" But for years after I resigned, I was still faithful to their way of thinking. I still believed in it. But not in the American Communists. I used to make a difference and think: \"These people here are damned fools but in Russia they have got the real thing,\" until I learned about the Hitler-Stalin pact, and gave up on the USSR.Mills notes that prior to becoming a \"friendly witness,\" Kazan discussed the issues with Miller:\n\nTo defend a secrecy I don't think right and to defend people who have already been named or soon would be by someone else ... I hate the Communists and have for many years, and don't feel right about giving up my career to defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I believe in, but not this.Miller put his arm around Kazan and retorted, \"Don't worry about what I'll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place.\"In his memoirs, Kazan writes that his testimony meant that \"the big shot had become the outsider.\" He also notes that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, Tennessee Williams, with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams \"the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nElia Kazan was married three times. His first wife was playwright Molly Day Thacher. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons, including screenwriter Nicholas Kazan. His second marriage, to the actress Barbara Loden, lasted from 1967 until her death in 1980, and produced one son. His marriage, in 1982, to Frances Rudge continued until his death, in 2003, aged 94.\nIn 1978, the U.S. government paid for Kazan and his family to travel to Kazan's birthplace where many of his films were to be shown. During a speech in Athens, he discussed his films and his personal and business life in the U.S., along with the messages he tried to convey:\n\nIn my own view, the solution is to talk about human beings and not about abstracts, to reveal the culture and the social moment as it is reflected in the behavior and the lives of individual people. Not to be \"correct.\" To be total. So I do not believe in any ideology that does not permit\u2014no encourage\u2014the freedom of the individual.\nHe also offered his opinions about the role of the U.S. as a world model for democracy:\n\nI think you and I, all of us, have some sort of stake in the United States. If it fails, the failure will be that of us all. Of mankind itself. It will cost us all.  ... I think of the United States as a country which is an arena and in that arena there is a drama being played out.  ... I have seen that the struggle is the struggle of free men.\nElia Kazan died from natural causes in his Manhattan apartment, September 28, 2003, aged 94.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nIn addition to these awards, Kazan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located on 6800 Hollywood Boulevard. He is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.Directed Academy Award Performances\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nKazan became known as an \"actor's director\" because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars. Under his direction, his actors received 24 Academy Award nominations and won nine Oscars.\nHe won as Best Director for Gentleman's Agreement (1947) and for On the Waterfront (1954). Both A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront were nominated for twelve Academy Awards, respectively winning four and eight.\n\nWith his many years with the Group Theatre and Actors Studio in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous \"for the power and intensity of his actors' performances.\" He was the pivotal figure in launching the film careers of Marlon Brando, James Dean, Julie Harris, Eli Wallach, Eva Marie Saint, Warren Beatty, Lee Remick, Karl Malden, and many others. Seven of Kazan's films won a total of 20 Academy Awards. Dustin Hoffman commented that he \"doubted whether he, Robert De Niro, or Al Pacino, would have become actors without Mr. Kazan's influence.\"Upon his death, at the age of 94, the New York Times described him as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history.\" The Death of a Salesman and A Streetcar Named Desire, two plays he directed, are considered to be some of the greatest of the 20th century. Although he became a respected director on Broadway, he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major film directors of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career \"he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations\", adding that \"he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema\". Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.His controversial stand during his testimony in front of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, became the low point in his career, although he remained convinced that he made the right decision to give the names of Communist Party members. He stated in an interview in 1976 that \"I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did, and betray my own soul. I didn't betray it. I made a difficult decision.\"During his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for directing on stage and screen. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for lifetime achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who wrote On the Waterfront, thanked his lifelong friend saying, \"Elia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.\"In 1999, at the 71st Academy Awards, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro presented the Honorary Oscar to Kazan. This would be a controversial pick for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences due to Kazan's past history regarding his involvement with the Hollywood Blacklist in the 1950s. Several members of the audience including Nick Nolte and Ed Harris refused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such as Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, and Kurt Russell gave him a standing ovation.Martin Scorsese has directed a film documentary, A Letter to Elia  (2010), considered to be an \"intensely personal and deeply moving tribute\" to Kazan. Scorsese was \"captivated\" by Kazan's films as a young man, and the documentary mirrors his own life story while he also credits Kazan as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker. It won a Peabody Award in 2010.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKazan, Elia (1962). America America. New York: Popular Library. OCLC 21378773.\nKazan, Elia (1967). The Arrangement: A Novel.

It consists of several types of religious architecture including an Orthodox church, a mosque, and a synagogue, among others. It is currently under construction since 1992, started by local artist and philanthropist Ildar Khanov (1940 - 2013). The structure now serves as a cultural center and a residence for Khanov's brother and sister, who both continue to serve as guides and supervisors of the complex.Khanov was known for his efforts in the treatment of alcoholism, drug addiction, and various other addictions. His patients helped him to maintain and develop the Temple, either by direct involvement in the construction work or through sponsorship.\nThe structure is not an active temple of any religion, but rather, as Khanov described its mission, a \"temple of culture and truth\". It has become a popular landmark in the city of Kazan, which takes pride in the peaceful combination of different cultures (Islamic Tatar culture, Orthodox Russian, and others). The Temple is often visited by local and overseas tourists.\nKhanov said that eventually the structure should have 16 cupolas, corresponding to the 16 major world religions, including past religions that are no longer practiced.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFor Eleven Years Long, the Tatar Healer Ildar Khanov Builds His Temple of All Religions (in Russian)\nTemple of All Religions at the Kazan city tourist portal\nRes Obscura : Ildar Khanov's All Religions Temple in Kazan\nLe temple de toutes les religions sur Chakipet (in French)",

The overall height of the temple is measured by the highest point of the cross above the main temple.\nThe number of domes is symbolical. One dome is a symbol of Christ or God, three domes are symbolic of Trinity, five domes symbolize Christ and Four Evangelists, seven domes are often used because seven is a holy number, and thirteen domes correspond to Christ and his twelve Apostles.

        "wiki": "J\u016brmala (Latvian pronunciation: [ju\u02d0rmala] (listen) \"seaside\") is a city in Latvia, about 25 kilometres (16 miles) west of Riga. J\u016brmala is a resort town stretching 32 km (20 miles) and sandwiched between the Gulf of Riga and the Lielupe River. It has a 33 km (21 miles) stretch of white-sand beach, and a population of 49,325 in 2019, making it the fifth-largest city in Latvia.\nWhile Latvia was part of the Soviet Union, J\u016brmala was a favorite holiday-resort and tourist destination for high-level Communist Party officials, particularly Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev. Although many amenities such as beach-houses and concrete hotels remain, some have fallen into disrepair. J\u016brmala remains a tourist attraction with long beaches facing the Gulf of Riga and romantic wooden houses in the Art Nouveau style.\n\n\n== Names and administrative history ==\nThe name J\u016brmala stems from Latvian j\u016bra (\"sea\") and mala (\"edge\", \"side\", \"margin\"), thus \"seaside\" in English. \nIn 1920, soon after Latvian independence, the town of R\u012bgas J\u016brmala (\"Seaside of Riga\") was established. In German it became known as Rigasche Strand and Riga-Strand (Beach of Riga), and advertised as part of Baltische Riviera (the Baltic Riviera)During World War II, J\u016brmala lost its autonomy and by 1946 it was a district of Riga. In 1949 this district was enlarged to include Priedaine. Finally, in 1959 the district of J\u016brmala was removed from the city of Riga and merged with the health resorts Sloka and \u0136emeri to establish J\u016brmalas pils\u0113ta (City of J\u016brmala). In publications dating from the Soviet period, the city name was occasionally spelled in English as \"Yurmala\", a back-transliteration from Russian \u042e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430.\nAs a result of the administrative territorial reform of Latvia in 2009, J\u016brmala became one of the republican cities of Latvia (Republikas pils\u0113tas), and is currently (2011) the fifth largest by population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city of J\u016brmala actually consists of a string of small resorts. From west to east, these include \u0136emeri, Jaun\u0137emeri, Sloka, Kauguri, Vaivari, Asari, Mellu\u017ei, Pumpuri, Jaundubulti, Dubulti, Majori, Dzintari, Bulduri and Lielupe.\nJ\u016brmala's reputation as a spa destination began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Wealthy landowners began the tradition of relaxing at the seaside, and Russian army officers came here to rest after the Napoleonic Wars, returning later with their families. The peak of the J\u016brmala area's development was the opening of the Riga - Tukums railway in 1877 (which still passes through J\u016brmala) that gave a great boost to the numbers of visitors, and thus a boost to the development of the town as a resort. J\u016brmala also gained a reputation as a health spa. The sea breeze, pine aroma, mineral springs, and sandy beach encouraged many sanatoriums to develop within the city.\nIn Soviet times J\u016brmala was popular with the Communist officials because of its beach and sanatoriums - holidays were also given as rewards for top union members. It became one of the most popular holiday destinations in the whole Union. The spas offered facilities from mud baths to riding therapy and hiking in the woods. In summer there are many concerts.\nWhereas Riga has advanced rapidly to embrace and cater for growing numbers of Western tourists, J\u016brmala has lagged behind. Russians are now subject to strict visa requirements and its beaches have yet to attract significant numbers of Europeans, leaving the tourist industry with a hard task on its hands. However, during the past few years, J\u016brmala has started to recover. Many Russian celebrities, successful businessmen and others buy houses near the beach, and a variety of festivals and other activities attract increasing crowds each summer. At the moment, J\u016brmala has almost resumed the popularity that it had with the Soviet elite.\nThe main beach at Majori and another at Bulduri now bear blue eco-flags signalling the sea is clean and safe to swim in, and the Latvian Academy of Science boasts a hotel for its members in the town. There is also the Midsummer Festival in June, celebrating the longest day of the year. The \"Jaunais Vilnis\" New Wave (competition) music festival showcases the latest music from all over Europe. The Lonely Planet guide to the region states that it is one of the highlights of Latvia.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe most distinguishing architectural feature in J\u016brmala is the prevalence of wooden houses dating from the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Most of the buildings were built by Baltic German and Latvian architects, but there are also works of Russian, Finnish and other architects. J\u016brmala's architecture typically falls into classicism, national romanticism, and modern styles. The town has an official list of 414 historical buildings under protection, as well as over 4,000 wooden structures.. Dubulti Station is an example of sculptural concrete shell Modernist architecture.\n\n\n== Beach ==\nJ\u016brmala's beach is 33 km (21 mi) long, covered with white quartz sand. The shallow coastal waters are suitable and safe for children. The beach is equipped with playgrounds, small benches, football fields and volleyball courts, as well as descents for prams and wheelchairs. In spring and autumn amber pieces can be found on the beach.\nEach region's beach has its own character. In Majori and Bulduri, where the Blue Flag flies, it is possible to rent water bicycles or relax in the beach cafe. In Dubulti and Dzintari competitions in beach football and volleyball take place, but on Pumpuri beach there is kite surfing and windsurfing.\nInternational water sports contests, including rowing, sailing, and waterskiing that take place on the river Lielupe.\n\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n\n\n=== Livu Akvaparks ===\n\nLivu Akvaparks (Latvian: L\u012bvu Akvaparks) in J\u016brmala is one of the largest water amusement parks in Northern Europe.

Due to the ban on Russian media personalities entering Latvia, both competitions were moved from J\u016brmala.The J\u016brmala International Piano Competition, arranged by the City Council and the Latvian Piano Teachers Association in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture of Latvia, for pianists of all nationalities aged 19 years and under, was established in 1994 and is held every two years in the \"Dzintari\" concert hall. As the International Academic Music Competition (with various categories), it reached its 11th Season in 2010.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nThe railway Riga-Tukums was built in 1875\u20131877. The route chosen included the narrow isthmus between Lielupe and the Gulf of Riga. A stretch of 13 km of the line runs within a kilometre of the sea, and there are ten stations within easy walking distance from the beach. This was a big boost to the development of J\u016brmala as a series of resorts along the coast. In 1912 a direct train connection was established with Moscow. The railway through J\u016brmala is currently double-track and electrified. The current railway stations in J\u016brmala, sorted from east to west, are Priedaine, Lielupe, Bulduri, Dzintari, Majori, Dubulti, Jaundubulti, Pumpuri, Mellu\u017ei, Asari, Vaivari, Sloka and \u0136emeri.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nA six lane road, designated A10 and E22, connects Riga to J\u016brmala. A road toll is required from non-residents to pass the 4-lane bridge over Lielupe (build in 1962) and drive into J\u016brmala. A railway overpass was built at Dzintari Station in 1976, giving a fast four-lane traffic flow into central J\u016brmala.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nRiga International Airport is only 18 km from central J\u016brmala (Majori). Confusingly, J\u016brmala Airport, a former Soviet air base, is further away (39 km) from central J\u016brmala, near Tukums.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 1 January 2019, the city had a population of 49,325.\n\n\n== Mayor ==\nRihards P\u0113tersons (1991)\nLigita Za\u010desta (1991-1994)\nAndrejs Inkulis (1994-1997)\nLeon\u012bds Alksnis (1997-2001)\nDainis Urbanovi\u010ds (2001-2003)\nJuris Hlevickis (2003-2005)\nInese Aizstrauta (2005-2006)\nRaimonds Munkevics (I term) (2006-2008)\n\u0122irts Trencis (2008-2009)\nRaimonds Munkevics (II term) (2009-2010)\nRomualds Ra\u017euks (2010)\nGatis Truksnis (I term) (2010-2013)\nJuris Visockis (2013)\nGatis Truksnis (II term) (2013-2016)\nRita Spro\u0123e (acting) (2016)\nGatis Truksnis (III term) (2016-2017)\nRita Spro\u0123e (2017)\nGatis Truksnis (IV term) (2017-present)\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2014 sister cities ==\n\nJ\u016brmala is twinned with:\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nJ\u016brmala at Curlie\nHistory of Jurmala\nJ\u016brmala (Latvia)\n\n\n=== Photos and videos ===\n360\u00b0 QTVR fullscreen panoramas of the Jurmala city\nImages from Jurmala \nPanorama of Jurmala (WebCam), balticlivecam.com",

It was built at the behest of Ivan the Terrible on the ruins of the former castle of Kazan khans. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nThe Kazan Kremlin includes many old buildings, the oldest of which is the Annunciation Cathedral (1554\u201462), the only 16th-century Russian church to have six piers and five apses. Like many of Kazan's buildings of the period, it is constructed of local pale sandstone rather than of brick. The renowned Pskov architects Postnik Yakovlev and Ivan Shirjay (called Barma) were invited by the Tzar to rebuild the Kazan Kremlin in stone. The cathedral bell tower was erected in five tiers at the urging of Ivan the Terrible and was scored to resemble the Ivan the Great Belltower in Moscow, but was pulled down by the Soviets in 1930.\nThe most conspicuous landmark of the Kazan Kremlin is the leaning S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower, which probably goes back to the reign of Peter the Great. A well-known legend connects the tower with the last queen of the Khanate of Kazan. Another recognizable architectural feature is the Spasskaya Tower, which anchors the southern end of the Kremlin and serves as the main entrance to the Kremlin. \nThe Spasskaya Tower is named after the Spassky Monastery, which used to be located nearby. Among the monastery's buildings were the Church of St. Nicholas (1560s, four piers) and the Cathedral of the Saviour's Transfiguration (1590s, six piers). They were destroyed by the Communists during Joseph Stalin's rule.\nAlso of interest are snow-white towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later renovated; the Qol-\u015e\u00e4rif mosque, recently rebuilt inside the citadel; and the Governor's House (1843\u201453), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan. The Palace is believed to be located on the site of a former Khan's palace. Tucked between Presidential Palace and S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower is the palace church built on the foundation of a medieval mosque.\nThe Northern wall of the Kremlin contains another gated tower, Secret Tower, so named because it used to house a secret water supply well. This tower allows pedestrian access to the Kremlin, but vehicle access is restricted to emergencies only.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Recent events ==\n\nThe opening of one of the biggest mosques in Europe, the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif Mosque, was held in Kazan on June 24, 2005. Roughly 17,000 people gathered for the celebration. Delegations from forty countries attended the event. The facility was reconstructed on the site where presumably Kazan Khanate's principal mosque had been standing before 1552. Speaking at the ceremony, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaeymiev said \"the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif mosque is a new symbol of Kazan and Tatarstan... a bridge connecting... our past and future.\" \nThe decree on restoring the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif mosque (1995) also ordered the restoration of the Annunciation Cathedral in the Kazan Kremlin which had been taken away from Orthodox Christians after the Russian Revolution. On July 21, 2005, the feast day of the holy icon \"Theotokos of Kazan\", in the presence of the crowd of 10,000 pilgrims, Patriarch Alexius II and Mintimer Shaeymiev placed at the newly restored Annunciation Cathedral the holiest copy of the long-lost icon, which had been returned to Russia in 2004 by Pope John Paul II shortly before his death.\nIn 2005 the first stage of the Kazan Metro also included a station named Kremlyovskaya (or Kreml in Tatar), whose exits are right next to the Kremlin.\n\n\n== Views ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKazan Kremlin State Museum and Historical Park (official site) (in English)\nWorld Heritage Patrimony\nPictures of Kazan Kremlin",

          "Half hour until a waiter came to take order after asking 4 times, even it is not busy. They put 1 spoon for 3 people. Food we ordered 1.5kg of meat dish and it came only 700 gram. We ordered \"bread basket\" and we got 2 dry half toasts for 3 people. Slowest service and we are",

Its capital is the city of Kazan.\nThe republic borders Kirov, Ulyanovsk, Samara, and Orenburg Oblasts, the Mari El, Udmurt, and Chuvash Republics, and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The area of the republic is 68,000 square kilometres (26,000 sq mi). The unofficial Tatarstan motto is Bez Buld\u0131rab\u0131z! (We can!). As of the 2010 Census, the population of Tatarstan was 3,786,488.The state has strong cultural ties with its eastern neighbor, the Republic of Bashkortostan.The state languages of the Republic of Tatarstan are Tatar and Russian.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\"Tatarstan\" derives from the name of the ethnic group\u2014the Tatars\u2014and the Persian suffix -stan (meaning \"state\" or \"country\" of, an ending common to many Eurasian countries). Another version of the Russian name is \"\u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0438\u044f\" (Tatariya), which was official along with \"Tatar ASSR\" during Soviet rule.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe republic is located in the center of the East European Plain, approximately 800 kilometers (500 mi) east of Moscow.  It lies between the Volga River and the Kama River (a tributary of the Volga), and extends east to the Ural mountains.\n\nBorders:\ninternal: Kirov Oblast (N), Udmurt Republic (N/NE), Republic of Bashkortostan (E/SE), Orenburg Oblast (SE), Samara Oblast (S), Ulyanovsk Oblast (S/SW), Chuvash Republic (W), Mari El Republic (W/NW).\nHighest point: 381 m (1,250 ft)\nMaximum N\u2013S distance: 290 km (180 mi)\nMaximum E\u2013W distance: 460 km (290 mi)\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\n\nMajor rivers include (Tatar names are given in parentheses):\n\nAzevka River (\u00c4zi)\nBelaya River (A\u011fidel)\nIk River (Iq)\nKama River (\u00c7ulman)\nVolga River (\u0130del)\nVyatka River (Noqrat)\nKazanka River (Qazansu)\nZay River (Z\u00e4y)\n\n\n=== Lakes ===\nMajor reservoirs of the republic include (Tatar names are given in parentheses):\n\nKuybyshev Reservoir (Kuyb\u0131\u015fev)\nLower Kama Reservoir (T\u00fcb\u00e4n Kama)\nZainsk Reservoir (Z\u00e4y susaqla\u011f\u0131\u00e7\u0131)The biggest lake is Qaban. The biggest swamp is Kulyagash.\n\n\n=== Hills ===\nBugulma-Belebey Upland\nVolga Upland\nVyatskie Uvaly\n\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nMajor natural resources of Tatarstan include oil, natural gas, gypsum, and more.  It is estimated that the Republic has over one billion tons of oil deposits.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAverage January temperature: \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F)\nAverage July temperature: +18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F)\nAverage annual temperature: +4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F)\nAverage annual precipitation: up to 500 to 550 mm (20 to 22 in)\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nAdministrative and territorial division: 43 municipal districts and 2 urban districts (Kazan and Naberezhnye Chelny), as well as 39 urban settlements and 872 rural settlements.\nThe Republic of Tatarstan consists of districts and cities of republican significance, the list of which is established by the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan. The districts consist of cities of district significance, urban-type settlements and rural settlements with subordinate territories that make up the primary level in the system of administrative-territorial structure of the Republic. Cities of national significance can be geographically divided into districts in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe earliest known organized state within the boundaries of Tatarstan was Volga Bulgaria (c. 700\u20131238). The Volga Bulgars had an advanced mercantile state with trade contacts throughout Inner Eurasia, the Middle East, and the Baltic, which maintained its independence despite pressure by such nations as the Khazars, the Kievan Rus, and the Cuman-Kipchaks. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922.\n\nVolga Bulgaria finally fell to the armies of the Mongol prince Batu Khan in the late 1230s (see Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria). The inhabitants, mixing with the Golden Horde's Kipchak-speaking people, became known as the \"Volga Tatars\". Another theory postulates that there were no ethnic changes in that period, and Bulgars simply switched to the Kipchak-based Tatar language. In the 1430s, the region again became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km (110 mi) up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars.\nThe Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. A large number of Bulgars were killed and forcibly converted to Christianity and were culturally Russified. Cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593 all mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine the Great. The first mosque to be rebuilt under Catherine's auspices was constructed in 1766\u20131770.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Tatarstan became a center of Jadidism, an Islamic movement that preached tolerance of other religions. Under the influence of local Jadidist theologians, the Bulgars were renowned for their friendly relations with other peoples of the Russian Empire. However, after the October Revolution religion was largely outlawed and all theologians were repressed.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nDuring the Civil War of 1918\u20131920 Tatar nationalists attempted to establish an independent republic (the Idel-Ural State). They were, however, put down by the Bolsheviks and the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was established on May 27, 1920. The boundaries of the republic did not include a majority of the Volga Tatars. The Tatar Union of the Godless were persecuted in Stalin's 1928 purges.\n\n\n==== 1921\u20131922 famine ====\n\nThere was a famine in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921 to 1922 as a result of war communist policy. The famine deaths of 2,000,000 Tatars in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region in 1921\u20131922 was catastrophic as half of Volga Tatar population in USSR died. This famine is also known as \"terror-famine\" and \"famine-genocide\" in Tatarstan. The Soviets settled ethnic Russians after the famine in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region causing the Tatar share of the population to decline to less than 50%. The All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) has asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921 Tatarstan famine as Genocide of Muslim Tatars. The 1921\u20131922 famine in Tatarstan has been compared to the Holodomor in Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nOn August 30, 1990, Tatarstan announced its sovereignty with the Declaration on the State Sovereignty of the Tatar Soviet Socialist Republic and in 1992 Tatarstan held a referendum on the new constitution. Some 62% of those who took part voted in favor of the constitution. In the 1992 Tatarstan Constitution, Tatarstan is defined as a Sovereign State. However, the referendum and constitution were declared unconstitutional by the Russian Constitutional Court.  Articles 1 and 3 of the Constitution as introduced in 2002 define Tatarstan as a part of the Russian Federation.\nOn February 15, 1994, the Treaty On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Authority between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan and Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan (On Delimitation of Authority in the Sphere of Foreign Economic Relations) were signed. The power-sharing agreement was renewed on July 11, 2007, though with much of the power delegated to Tatarstan reduced.On December 20, 2008, in response to Russia recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Milli Mejlis of the Tatar People declared Tatarstan independent and asked for United Nations recognition. However, this declaration was ignored both by the United Nations and the Russian government. On July 24, 2017, the autonomy agreement signed in 1994 between Moscow and Kazan expired, making Tatarstan the last republic of Russia to lose its special status.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation: 3,786,488\u2009(2010 Census); 3,779,265\u2009(2002 Census); 3,637,809\u2009(1989 Census).\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\n\n\n=== Vital statistics ===\n\nNote: TFR source.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nThere are about 2 million ethnic Tatars and 1.5 million ethnic Russians, along with significant numbers of Chuvash, Mari, and Udmurts, some of whom are Tatar-speaking. The Ukrainian, Mordvin, and Bashkir minorities are also significant. Most Tatars are Sunni Muslims, but a small minority known as Ker\u00e4\u015fen Tatars are Orthodox and some of them regard themselves as being different from other Tatars even though most Ker\u00e4\u015fen dialects differ only slightly from the Central Dialect of the Tatar language.There is a fair degree of speculation as to the early origins of the different groups of Tatars, but most Tatars no longer view religious identity as being as important as it once was, and the religious and linguistic subgroups have intermingled considerably. Nevertheless, despite many decades of assimilation and intermingling, some Ker\u00e4\u015fen demanded and were awarded the option of being specifically enumerated in 2002. This has provoked great controversy, however, as many intellectuals have sought to portray the Tatars as homogeneous and indivisible. Although listed separately below, the Ker\u00e4\u015fen are still included in the grand total for the Tatars. Another unique ethnic group, concentrated in Tatarstan, is the Qaratay Mordvins.\n\n\n=== Jews in Tatarstan ===\n\nTatar and Udmurt Jews are special territorial groups of the Ashkenazi Jews, which started to be formed in the residential areas of mixed Turkic-speaking (Tatars, Kryashens, Bashkirs, Chuvash people), Finno-Ugric-speaking (Udmurts, Mari people) and Slavic-speaking (Russians) population. The Ashkenazi Jews on the territory of Tatarstan first appeared in the 1830s. The Jews of Udmurtia and Tatarstan are subdivided on cultural and linguistic characteristics into two territorial groups: 1) Udmurt Jews (Udmurt Jewry), who lived on the territory of Udmurtia and the north of Tatarstan; 2) Tatar Jews or Kazan Jews (Tatar Jewry or Kazan Jewry), who lived mainly in the city of Kazan and its agglomeration.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the two state languages of the republic are Tatar and Russian. According to the 2002 Russian Federal Law (On Languages of Peoples of the Russian Federation), the official script is Cyrillic. Linguistic anthropologist Dr. Suzanne Wertheim, notes that \"some men signal ideological devotion to the Tatar cause by refusing to accommodate to Russian-dominant public space or Russian speakers\", whilst women, in promoting \"the Tatar state and Tatar national culture, index their pro-Tatar ideological stances more diplomatically, and with linguistic practices situated only within the Tatar-speaking community ... in keeping with normative gender roles within the Tatar republic.\"\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nEstablished in 922, the first Muslim state within the boundaries of modern Russia was Volga Bulgaria from which the Tatars inherited Islam. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922. Islam's long presence in Russia also extends at least as far back as the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, which brought the Tatars and Bashkirs on the Middle Volga into Russia.\n\nIn the 1430s, the region became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars. The Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. Some Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593, mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine II.\nWhen it comes to religion, Islam is the most common faith in Tatarstan, as, 48.8% of the estimated 3.8 million population is Muslim while the remaining population is mostly Russian Orthodox Christian and non-religious.In 1990, there were only 100 mosques but the number, as of 2004, rose to well over 1,000. As of January 1, 2008, as many as 1,398 religious organizations were registered in Tatarstan, of which 1,055 were Muslim. Islam is the most common faith in Tatarstan, as, according one study, 38.8% of the population is Muslim. In September 2010, Eid al-Fitr as well May 21, the day the Volga Bulgars embraced Islam, were made public holidays. Tatarstan also hosted an international Muslim film festival which screened over 70 films from 28 countries including Jordan, Afghanistan, and Egypt.The Russian Orthodox Church is the second largest active religion in Tatarstan, and has been so for more than 150 years, with an estimated 1.6 million followers made up of ethnic Russians, Mordvins, Armenians, Belarusians, Mari people, Georgians, Chuvash and a number of Orthodox Tatars which together constitute 45% of the 3.8 million population of Tatarstan. On 23 August 2010, the \"Orthodox monuments of Tatarstan\" exhibition was held in Kazan by the Tatarstan Ministry of Culture and the Kazan Eparchy. At all public events, an Orthodox Priest is called upon along with an Islamic Mufti.The Muslim Religious Board of Tatarstan frequently organizes activities, like the 'Islamic graffiti Contest' which was held on November 20, 2011.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe head of the government in Tatarstan is the President.  Since March 2010, the President has been Rustam Minnikhanov. Tatarstan's unicameral State Council has 100 seats: fifty are for representatives of the parties, and the other fifty are for deputies from the republic's localities. The Chairman of the State Council is Farit Mukhametshin since May 27, 1998. The government is the \u0421abinet of Ministers. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Tatarstan is Alexei Pesoshin.\nAccording to the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the President can be elected only by the people of Tatarstan, but due to Russian federal law, this law was suspended for an indefinite term. The Russian law on the election of governors says they should be elected by regional parliaments and that the candidate can be presented only by the president of Russia.\nOn March 25, 2005 Shaymiyev was re-elected for his fourth term by the State Council. This election was held after changes in electoral law and does not contradict the Constitutions of Tatarstan and Russia.\n\n\n=== Political status ===\n\nThe Republic of Tatarstan is a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Most of the Russian federal subjects are tied with the Russian federal government by the uniform Federal Treaty, but relations between the government of Tatarstan and the Russian federal government are more complex and are precisely defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan.  The following passage from the Constitution defines the republic's status without contradicting the Constitution of the Russian Federation:\n\"The Republic of Tatarstan is a democratic constitutional State associated with the Russian Federation by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Powers between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan, and a subject of the Russian Federation. The sovereignty of the Republic of Tatarstan shall consist in full possession of the State authority (legislative, executive and judicial) beyond the competence of the Russian Federation and powers of the Russian Federation in the sphere of shared competence of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan and shall be an inalienable qualitative status of the Republic of Tatarstan.\"\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTatarstan is one of the most economically developed regions of Russia. The republic is highly industrialized and ranks second to Samara Oblast in terms of industrial production per km2. in 2017 Tatarstan's GDP per capita was $10,000, with total GDP at about $35 billion.The region's main source of wealth is oil. Tatarstan produces 32 million tonnes of crude oil per year and has estimated oil reserves of more than 1 billion tons. Industrial production constitutes 45% of the Republic's gross regional domestic product. The most developed manufacturing industries are petrochemical industry and machine building. The truck-maker KamAZ is the region's largest enterprise and employs about one-fifth of Tatarstan's workforce. Kazanorgsintez, based in Kazan, is one of Russia's largest chemical companies. Tatarstan's aviation industry produces Tu-214 passenger airplanes and helicopters. The Kazan Helicopter Plant is one of the largest helicopter manufacturers in the world. Engineering, textiles, clothing, wood processing, and food industries are also of key significance in Tatarstan.\n\nTatarstan consists of three distinct industrial regions. The northwestern part is an old industrial region where engineering, chemical, and light industry dominate. In the newly industrial northeast region with its core in the Naberezhnye Chelny\u2013Nizhnekamsk agglomeration, major industries are automobile construction, the chemical industry, and power engineering. The southeast region has oil production with engineering under development. The north, central, south, and southwest parts of the republic are rural regions. The republic has huge water resources\u2014the annual flow of rivers of the Republic exceeds 240 billion m3 (8.5 trillion cu ft). Soils are very diverse, the best fertile soils covering one-third of the territory. Due to the high development of agriculture in Tatarstan (it contributes 5.1% of the total revenue of the republic), forests occupy only 16% of its territory. The agricultural sector of the economy is represented mostly by large companies as \"Ak Bars Holding\" and \"Krasniy Vostok Agro\".\nThe republic has a highly developed transport network. It mainly comprises highways, railway lines, four navigable rivers \u2014 Volga (\u0130del), Kama (\u00c7ulman), Vyatka (Noqrat) and Belaya (A\u011fidel), and oil pipelines and airlines. The territory of Tatarstan is crossed by the main gas pipelines carrying natural gas from Urengoy and Yamburg to the west and the major oil pipelines supplying oil to various cities in the European part of Russia.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThere are three UNESCO world heritage sites in Tatarstan-Kazan Kremlin, Bulgarian state Museum-reserve and assumption Cathedral and Monastery of the town-island of Sviyazhsk.The annual growth rate of tourist flow to the republic is on average 13.5%, the growth rate of the volume of services in the tourism sector is 17.0%.At the end of 2016 on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan there were 104 tour operators, of which 32 dealt in domestic tourism, 65 in domestic and inbound tourism, 1 in domestic and outbound tourism, and 6 in all three.As of January 1, 2017, 404 collective accommodation facilities (CSR) operate in the Republic of Tatarstan, 379 CSR are subject to classification (183 in Kazan, 196 in other municipalities of the Republic of Tatarstan). 334 collective accommodation facilities received the certificate of assignment of the category, which is 88.1% of the total number of operating.\nIn 2016, special attention was paid to the development of tourist centers of the Republic of Tatarstan \u2013 Kazan, Bolghar, the town-island of Sviyazhsk, Yelabuga, Chistopol, Tetyushi.

The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme aims to create spaces for meeting or recreation. The programme covers a wide spectrum of projects, including streets, squares, parks, river banks, pavilions, and sports facilities.Since 2016 (and continuing until 2022), the Architecturny Desant Architectural Bureau in Kazan is improving public spaces in each of Tatarstan's 45 municipal districts, from large cities to small villages. As of April 2019, the project had revamped 328 public spaces. By creating and rehabilitating public spaces, the programme aims to be a catalyst for positive social, economic, and environmental change.One notable example is the \"Beach\" at Almetyevsk, which includes public swimming pools and a terrace. Other examples include an amphitheatre in Black Lake Park, Kazan; the Central Square in Bavly; a children's playground in Bogatye Saby village, which has a unique wooden play structure; the Cube container centre in the green beach at Gorkinsko-Ometievsky forest, Kazan; and the square on Festival Boulevard, Kazan.The programme used an innovative participatory design approach, which later became mandatory for similar projects across Russia. This approach partners specialists with local residents at every stage of the project, from development, to implementation, to the ongoing use of the space.The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme was announced as one of the six winners of the 2019 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The jury was impressed by the programme's systematic approach and involvement of residents to decide the future of each space.Each public space expresses the unique identity of that particular place, tying in its history while incorporating traditional materials.

In 1835, the first parish was founded by Polish priests, and its parishioners gathered in private homes or temporary structures. The Catholic population, mostly of Polish origin, increased steadily, and the city of Kazan ultimately granted permission to build the church in 1855. Permission to build the church came with the conditions that the church would not stand out from the surrounding buildings and would not display a strong traditional Roman Catholic architectural character.\nKazan's Catholic parish dispersed during the era of communism and was reconvened in 1995, but the church was not returned to the Catholic community. Officials of the city instead authorized the use of a small chapel located in one of the city's cemeteries. Once restored, the chapel was consecrated by Bishop Pickel in 1998. A few years later, due to the removal of the wind tunnel from the old church, city authorities decided to allocate land in the center of Kazan to the Catholic community. Construction of the new church began in 2005 and took three years to complete.\nOn 29 August 2008, the new church was consecrated during a ceremony led by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Angelo Sodano, in the presence of the Bishop Clemens Pickel, the Apostolic Nuncio Antonio Mennini, and other leaders.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholicism in Russia\nExaltation of the Holy Cross\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The House of Zinaida Ushkova is a building in Kazan, in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, which was reconstructed in the beginning of the 20th century in an eclectic style. It is an impressive sight in the city center and an object of Russian heritage. In 1919 it became a central building of the National Library of the Republic of Tatarstan and is now open to visitors and tourists.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlexey Ushkov, son of the K.K. Ushkov - owner of chemical plants and grandson of tea magnate A.S. Gubkin married Zinaida Vysockaya - daughter of Nikolay Vysockiy - professor of surgery, during his student times in Kazan State University.\nAs a wedding gift for his wife, Alexey ordered plan reconstruction of the house in Kazan at Voskresenskaya street in Kazan (nowadays Lobachevskaya street) and house in Moscow (Ermolov House ar Prechistenka, 20)  to structural architect Karl Mufke. There is no accurate data about who worked on reconstruction of the house in Moscow. Reconstruction of Kazan buildings Karl Mufke leaded himself. Both buildings performed in mixed style with predominance of baroque and Empire styles.\nHouse of Ushkova had been reconstructed during 1904-1908 (by other sources at 1903-1907) from three buildings located at Voskresenskaya street. Architect was so engaged into his work that sometimes might forgout about his security. Newspapers of that time write that once he fell down from falseworks and broke two of his ribs but got up and continued his work.\nMain part of the premises was demised for living and commerce. For example all ground floor was demised for the shops.\nAfter October Revolution property of Ushkov family was expropriated. In 1919 House of Ushkova became a central building of National Library of the Republic of Tatarstan - one of the biggest libraries of Volga region.\nInitial house planning and interior finishing well preserved.\n\n\n== Interesting facts ==\nZinaida and Alexey broke up after three years of marriage. Alexey got married second time to Alexandra Balashova, prima ballerina of Bolshoi Theater.",

His range of works included portraits, landscapes, realistic compositions, Russian epics, Slavic and Teutonic mythology, and battle paintings. Vasilyev popularized legendary characters of the Russian folk art, songs and fairy tales: Ilya Muromets, Mikula Selyaninovich, Svyatogor, Dunay Ivanovich, Dobrynya Nikitich, Volga Svyatoslavich and others. His Scandinavian and Germanic saga cycle includes depictions of Odin, Freyja and valkyries. Several paintings are devoted to the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people. These include \"Marshal Zhukov\", \"Invasion\", \"The Parade of 1941\" and \"Nostalgia.\"\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nKonstantin Vasilyev died on October 29, 1976 in a railway accident near Kazan. His family and friends never believed in the official version of his death and suspected that the painter was murdered. Vasilyev was buried in the village of Vasilyevo, where he lived since 1949. Recognition came posthumously. A documentary \"Vasilyev from Vasilyevo\" was released in 1978. The Konstantin Vasilyev Museum opened in Moscow in 1998. Another film about the painter under the title \"A man with an eagle-owl. Konstantin Vasilyev\" was made in 2002. In 2012 Konstantin Vasilyev Museum in Moscow was renamed the Konstantin Vasilyev Centre of the Slavic Culture. Next year, in 2013, the Konstantin Vasilyev Art Gallery was opened in Kazan.\nVasilyev's oeuvres steadily gained in popularity through the late Soviet and early post-Soviet periods, until they have reached a virtually iconic status among Russian nationalists, neo-pagans and fantasy geeks.\nThe minor planet 3930 Vasilev, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1982 is named after him.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDoronin, A.I.

The alternative name of the mosque, and the most commonly used name, is The Mosque Across the Kaban (Russian: \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442\u044c, Zakabannaya mechet\u2019; Tatar: Cyrillic \u041a\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d \u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b \u043c\u04d9\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435, Latin Qaban art\u0131 m\u00e4\u00e7ete, Arabic  \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0626 \u0645\u06d5\u0686\u0626\u062a\u0626), because most of Kazan's mosques are situated on the other side of the Kaban, where the Tatar community was traditionally located before the October Revolution. The part where the mosque was situated was inhabited predominantly by the Russian community.\n\n\n== History ==\nBased on a design by Pechnikov from 1914, the mosque was built from 1924 to 1926 with private donations by Muslims. It was the only mosque built in the region during the Soviet period. It was closed in the 1930s as part of the Soviet Unions persecution of Muslims and was only reopened and used by Muslims in 1991.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIslam in Tatarstan\nIslam in Russia\nList of mosques in Russia\n\n\n== References ==\n(in Russian) [1]\nThe Thousandth Anniversary of Islam Mosque on \"Russian mosques\"",

        "wiki": "Kazan (; Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0301\u043d\u044c, IPA: [k\u0250\u02c8zan\u02b2]; Tatar: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. With a population of 1,243,500, it is the sixth most populous city in Russia.\nKazan lies at the confluence of the Volga and Kazanka Rivers in Western Russia, about 715 kilometres (444 mi) east from Moscow. In the Late Middle Ages, Kazan was an important trade and political center within the Golden Horde. In 1438, the city became the capital of the Khanate of Kazan. In 1552, Kazan was captured by Ivan the Terrible and became part of Russia. The city was largely destroyed during Pugachev's Rebellion, but was later rebuilt during the reign of Catherine the Great. In the following centuries, Kazan grew to become a major industrial, cultural and religious center in Russia. Kazan was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nKazan is renowned for its vibrant mix of Oriental and Russian cultures. In 2015, 2.1 million tourists visited Kazan, and 1.5 million tourists visited the Kazan Kremlin, a World Heritage Site. In April 2009, the Russian Patent Office granted Kazan the right to brand itself as the \"Third Capital\" of Russia.  In 2009 it was chosen as the \"sports capital of Russia\" and it still is referred to as such.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name Kazan is uncertain. The most accepted legends derive it from the Bulgar (and also modern Tatar) word qazan, which means 'boiler' or 'cauldron'. Most often appeal to the version of the boiling boiler: the sorcerer advised the Bulgars to build a city where, without any fire, a boiler dug into the ground would boil water. As a result, a similar place was found on the shore of Lake Kaban. One legend claims that the city was named after the river Kazanka, which was named after the son of a Bulgar governor who dropped a copper cauldron into it. Other local legends, including research by the Tatar scholar Shihabeddin Marjani, claim that the city was named for the resemblance of the hill on which it sits to an upturned cauldron.\nQazan/Kazan was a choice name for the male Turkic/Mongol royalty, most notably that of the Ilkhanid Mongol king, Qazan Khan. It is likely that the city was named after a Mongol/Turkic khan by that name when the city was founded or soon thereafter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAccording to the official version adopted today, the city was founded more than 1,000 years ago. The estimated date of the urban settlement on the site of Kazan is 1004\u20131005 AD. The reason for this dating was found during excavations in the Kazan Kremlin - a Czech coin, dated by the Board of St. Wenceslaus (presumably, coinage 929\u2013930 years) and the earliest Czech coin, the remains of masonry and wooden city fence, handicrafts and utensils (Hungarian type lining, women's beads, etc.), as well as other artifacts with less obvious dating. According to official statements, experts from 20 cities of Russia and 22 countries of the world were involved in the study of findings related to the age of Kazan.Kazan was a border post between Volga Bulgaria and two Finno-Ugric peoples\u2014the Mari and Udmurt. Another vexatious question is where the citadel was built originally. Archaeological explorations have produced evidence of urban settlement in three parts of the modern city: in the Kremlin; in Bi\u015fbalta at the site of the modern Zilantaw monastery; and near the Qaban lake. The oldest of these seems to be the Kremlin.\nAfter the Mongols ravaged the Bol\u011far and Bil\u00e4r territories in the 13th century, the surviving Bulgars recovered in numbers and a small number of Kipchaks were assimilated from which they adopted their language (the so-called Bulgarism), or Kipchaks and Bulgars mixed to create a modern Kazan-Tatar population. Some Tatars also went to Lithuania, brought by Vytautas the great. Kazan became the center of the Principality, which was dependent on The Golden Horde. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Kazan was growing, becoming an important trade and political center within The Golden Horde. The growth of the city was also promoted by the successful geographical location at the intersection of major trade routes connecting East and West. During the same period, the minting of currency began with the indication of the place of minting\u2014\"Bulgar al-Jadid\", that is, a New Bulgar.\nIn 1438, the Bulgar fortress Kazan (ISKE-Kazan) was captured by the ousted Golden Horde Khan Ulugh Muhammad, who killed the local Prince Swan and moved the fortress to a modern place (according to Russian Chronicles). The city became the capital of the Kazan Khanate. The city Bazaar, Ta\u015f Ayaq (stone foot) has become the most important shopping center in the region, especially for furniture. Handicraft production also flourished, as the city gained a reputation for its leather and gold products, as well as the wealth of its palaces and mosques. \nKazan had trade relations with Moscow, Crimea, Turkey and other regions.\n\n\n=== Russian Tsardom period ===\n\nAs a result of the Siege of Kazan in 1552, Tsar Ivan the Terrible conquered the city and massacred the majority of the population. During the subsequent governorship of Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky, most of the Kazan's Tatar residents were forcibly Christianized or deported, the Kerashen Tatars. Mosques and palaces were ruined. The surviving Tatar population was moved to a place 50 kilometers (31 mi) away from the city and this place was forcibly settled by Russian farmers and soldiers. Tatars in the Russian service were settled in the Tatar Bist\u00e4se settlement near the city's wall. Later Tatar merchants and handicraft masters also settled there. During this period, Kazan was largely destroyed as a result of several great fires. After one of them in 1579, the icon Our Lady of Kazan was discovered in the city.\nIn the early 17th century, at the beginning of the Time of Troubles in Russia, the Tsardom of Kazan declared independence under the leadership of voyvoda Nikanor Shulgin with the help of the Russian population, but this independence was suppressed by Kuzma Minin in 1612.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire period ===\n\nIn 1708, the Tsardom of Kazan was abolished, and Kazan became the seat of Kazan Governorate. After Peter the Great's visit, the city became a center of shipbuilding for the Caspian fleet. The major Russian poet Gavrila Derzhavin was born in Kazan in 1743, the son of a poor country squire of Tatar ancestry though himself having a thoroughly Russian identity.\nBefore the building of modern dams, low-lying areas were regularly flooded in April and May. Kazan suffered major fires in 1595, 1672, 1694, 1742, 1749, 1757 1744, 1815 and 1842.\nKazan was largely destroyed in 1774 as a result of the Pugachev revolt (1774\u20131776), an uprising by border troops and peasants led by the Don Cossack ataman (Captain) Yemelyan Pugachev, but the city, formerly largely of timber construction, was soon afterwards rebuilt, using stone and according to a grid pattern plan, during the reign of Catherine the Great. Catherine also decreed that mosques could again be built in Kazan, the first being Marjani Mosque.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century Kazan State University and printing press were founded by Alexander I. It became an important center for Oriental Studies in Russia. The Qur'an was first printed in Kazan in 1801. Kazan became an industrial center and peasants migrated there to join its industrial workforce. In 1875, a horse tramway appeared; 1899 saw the installation of a tramway. After the Russian Revolution of 1905, Tatars were allowed to revive Kazan as a Tatar cultural center. The first Tatar theater and the first Tatar newspaper appeared.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nIn 1917, Kazan became one of the revolution centers. In 1918, Kazan was the capital of the Idel-Ural State, which was suppressed by the Bolshevist government. In the Kazan Operation of August 1918, it was briefly occupied by Czechoslovak Legions. In 1920, Kazan became the center of Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In the 1920s and 1930s, most of the city's mosques and churches were destroyed, as occurred elsewhere in the USSR. \nAfter the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) until 1933, the German and the Russian army operated together the Kama tank school in Kazan.\nDuring World War II, many industrial plants and factories to the west were relocated in Kazan, making the city a center of the military industry, producing tanks and planes. After the war Kazan consolidated as an industrial and scientific center. In 1979, the city's population reached one million.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\nIn the late 1980s and in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazan again became the center of Tatar culture and identity, and separatist tendencies intensified. With the return of capitalism, Kazan became one of the most important centers of the Russian Federation. The city went from 10th to 8th position in population ranking of Russian cities. In the early 2000s, the city earned the right to host both the 2013 Summer Universiade and 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n==== Millennium of Kazan ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSince 2000, the city has been undergoing a total renovation. The historical center\u2014including the Kremlin\u2014has been rebuilt, however a large number of the city's historical districts were completely demolished in the renovation. Kazan celebrated its millennium in 2005, after a city-organized historical commission settled on 1005 as the official year of the city's founding. During the millennium celebrations, one of the largest mosque in Russia, Qolsharif, was dedicated in the Kazan Kremlin, the holiest copy of Our Lady of Kazan was returned to the city, the Millennium Bridge was inaugurated that year, and the Kazan Metro began operation. The government of the Russian Federation released the Medal \"In Commemoration of the 1000th Anniversary of Kazan\".\nIn 2010, for the preparations to the 2013 Universiade, Kazan began even more renovation by modernizing its airport, fixing the streets, enhancing public transport, and adopting Russian, English, and Tatar languages in all transportation, large stores, and shopping centers.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe historical symbol of Kazan is the mythical dragon-like creature Zilant, often mentioned in legends. For example, when numerous snakes and reptiles severely hampered the development of the city, the hunters went in search of the King of snakes and defeated him, according to another version, the residents of the city bought off the giant snake with gold, after which all the snakes left the city. Another legend says that the giant dragon-like serpent always guarded the Khan's treasures, and that it still protects the hidden wealth before the capture of the city in the secret caves. Historically, it is true that snakes were once numerous in the Kazan region, but then their number has decreased dramatically. The first official coat of arms of Kazan was approved on 18 October 1781 and was described as \"black snake under the crown of gold, Kazan, red wings, white field\". In 1926, the country introduced a ban on such heraldry. In the 1980s, the coat of arms of Kazan began to reappear, and in the 1990s Kazan Zilant in various styles began to appear in print media. Modern graphics of the emblem and flag appeared in 2005\u2014in a silver field on the green earth a black dragon with red wings and tongue, with gold paws, claws and eyes, topped with a gold crown. The shield is crowned with a Kazan cap. According to the traditions of heraldry, the dragon symbolizes power, wisdom and invincibility, the earth\u2014life and wealth, the crown-development, and the cap above the shield-the capital of the city.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nKazan is the capital of the republic.

As a result of its far inland position, summers are extremely warm for its latitude and winters are quite cold compared to areas further west in Europe.The warmest month is July with daily mean temperature near 20.2 \u00b0C (68.4 \u00b0F), and the coldest month is January, with a daily mean of \u221210.4 \u00b0C (13.3 \u00b0F).The city set its two hottest days on record during the 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves.

Major monuments in the Kremlin are the five-domed, six-columned Annunciation Cathedral (1561\u201362) and the mysterious, formerly leaning S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower, named after the last queen of Kazan and regarded as the city's most conspicuous landmark.\nAlso of interest are the towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later reconstructed; the Qol-\u015earif Mosque, which has been rebuilt inside the citadel; remains of the Saviour Monastery (a 16th-century cathedral demolished by the Bolsheviks) with the Spasskaya Tower; and the Governor's House (1843\u201353), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of Tatarstan.\nNext door, the ornate baroque Sts-Peter-and-Paul's Cathedral on Qawi Nacmi Street and Marcani Mosque on Qayum Nasiri Street date back to the 18th century.\n\n\n==== Towers ====\nThe Spasskaya Tower was built in two floors by 16th century Pskov architects Ivan Shiryai and Postnik Yakovlev. From the inside, the northern side of the fortress to the Spasskaya Tower adjoined the gate to Spasskaya Church, which has now merged with the tower. The typical Pskovian architectural elements of the facade face the main street of the Kremlin. At the end of the 17th century, instead of three tiers, the tower was built with two brick eight-sided tiers with a brick roof, getting its present, familiar appearance. Until 1917, the tower was crowned with the double-headed coat of arms of the Russian state. In the 18th century, a ringing clock was installed in the upper tier, and even earlier a large bell was moved from a small belfry (now lost, located on the castle wall on the left side of the tower). Until the middle of the 19th century, there was a moat with a stone bridge in front of the tower.\nThe South-Western Tower was built simultaneously with the Spasskaya tower by Pskov masters and is a classic example of the Pskov style of defensive structures.\nThe name of the Transfiguration Tower comes from the Transfiguration Monastery of the Savior, which was fenced from the north-west. The tower was also built by Pskov architects Postnik and Barma, but it was significantly rebuilt later, as it has strong traces of the architectural influence of the Moscow defensive architecture. The territory from the Transfiguration Tower to the Spasskaya pass was added to the old Khan's fortress by Pskov masters.\nThere are unnamed round brick towers, presumably built by Moscow architects in the 17th century.\nThe Tainitskaya Tower was built in its present form in the 1550s by Postnik Yakovlev. It was named after a secret source from which it was possible to take water during a siege. The entrance to the tower is in the form of a \"knee\", which increased the defense of the Kremlin. It replaced a tower from the time of the khanate, Nur Ali (in Russian transcription Muraleeva). The 22-year-old Tsar Ivan the Terrible entered the conquered city through the Nur Ali tower.\nThe North-Eastern Round Tower was demolished after the Pugachev's assault.\nThe Consistor Tower was built in brick by Moscow architects in the 17th century, its name was given in the 18th century from the Spiritual Consistory located near the tower in the Kremlin.

The original portion, built for a merchant named Usmanov in the 1860s, was bought by the inter-related families of Efim Smolentzev and Pavel and Nikolai Shmelev in 1899. They operated a store selling, among other things, tea. In 1910, the Smolentevs and Shmelevs constructed another portion, designed by architect Vasili Trifonov, and operated a hotel there. After the Russian Revolution, the building eventually became the Hotel Soviet and after 2000 it was heavily renovated to reopen as the Shalyapin Palace Hotel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Education and science ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nPrimary and secondary education system of Kazan includes:\n\n282 nurseries, most of which are municipal\n178 schools, 2 of which are private\n28 vocational technical schools\n15 colleges\n10 special collegesThere are also 49 music schools, 43 sports school, and 10 fine-arts schools, including the Kazan Art School founded in 1895.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nThere are 44 institutes of higher education in Kazan, including 19 branches of universities from other cities.

        "wiki": "Kazan (; Russian: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0301\u043d\u044c, IPA: [k\u0250\u02c8zan\u02b2]; Tatar: \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. With a population of 1,243,500, it is the sixth most populous city in Russia.\nKazan lies at the confluence of the Volga and Kazanka Rivers in Western Russia, about 715 kilometres (444 mi) east from Moscow. In the Late Middle Ages, Kazan was an important trade and political center within the Golden Horde. In 1438, the city became the capital of the Khanate of Kazan. In 1552, Kazan was captured by Ivan the Terrible and became part of Russia. The city was largely destroyed during Pugachev's Rebellion, but was later rebuilt during the reign of Catherine the Great. In the following centuries, Kazan grew to become a major industrial, cultural and religious center in Russia. Kazan was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nKazan is renowned for its vibrant mix of Oriental and Russian cultures. In 2015, 2.1 million tourists visited Kazan, and 1.5 million tourists visited the Kazan Kremlin, a World Heritage Site. In April 2009, the Russian Patent Office granted Kazan the right to brand itself as the \"Third Capital\" of Russia.  In 2009 it was chosen as the \"sports capital of Russia\" and it still is referred to as such.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name Kazan is uncertain. The most accepted legends derive it from the Bulgar (and also modern Tatar) word qazan, which means 'boiler' or 'cauldron'. Most often appeal to the version of the boiling boiler: the sorcerer advised the Bulgars to build a city where, without any fire, a boiler dug into the ground would boil water. As a result, a similar place was found on the shore of Lake Kaban. One legend claims that the city was named after the river Kazanka, which was named after the son of a Bulgar governor who dropped a copper cauldron into it. Other local legends, including research by the Tatar scholar Shihabeddin Marjani, claim that the city was named for the resemblance of the hill on which it sits to an upturned cauldron.\nQazan/Kazan was a choice name for the male Turkic/Mongol royalty, most notably that of the Ilkhanid Mongol king, Qazan Khan. It is likely that the city was named after a Mongol/Turkic khan by that name when the city was founded or soon thereafter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAccording to the official version adopted today, the city was founded more than 1,000 years ago. The estimated date of the urban settlement on the site of Kazan is 1004\u20131005 AD. The reason for this dating was found during excavations in the Kazan Kremlin - a Czech coin, dated by the Board of St. Wenceslaus (presumably, coinage 929\u2013930 years) and the earliest Czech coin, the remains of masonry and wooden city fence, handicrafts and utensils (Hungarian type lining, women's beads, etc.), as well as other artifacts with less obvious dating. According to official statements, experts from 20 cities of Russia and 22 countries of the world were involved in the study of findings related to the age of Kazan.Kazan was a border post between Volga Bulgaria and two Finno-Ugric peoples\u2014the Mari and Udmurt. Another vexatious question is where the citadel was built originally. Archaeological explorations have produced evidence of urban settlement in three parts of the modern city: in the Kremlin; in Bi\u015fbalta at the site of the modern Zilantaw monastery; and near the Qaban lake. The oldest of these seems to be the Kremlin.\nAfter the Mongols ravaged the Bol\u011far and Bil\u00e4r territories in the 13th century, the surviving Bulgars recovered in numbers and a small number of Kipchaks were assimilated from which they adopted their language (the so-called Bulgarism), or Kipchaks and Bulgars mixed to create a modern Kazan-Tatar population. Some Tatars also went to Lithuania, brought by Vytautas the great. Kazan became the center of the Principality, which was dependent on The Golden Horde. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Kazan was growing, becoming an important trade and political center within The Golden Horde. The growth of the city was also promoted by the successful geographical location at the intersection of major trade routes connecting East and West. During the same period, the minting of currency began with the indication of the place of minting\u2014\"Bulgar al-Jadid\", that is, a New Bulgar.\nIn 1438, the Bulgar fortress Kazan (ISKE-Kazan) was captured by the ousted Golden Horde Khan Ulugh Muhammad, who killed the local Prince Swan and moved the fortress to a modern place (according to Russian Chronicles). The city became the capital of the Kazan Khanate. The city Bazaar, Ta\u015f Ayaq (stone foot) has become the most important shopping center in the region, especially for furniture. Handicraft production also flourished, as the city gained a reputation for its leather and gold products, as well as the wealth of its palaces and mosques. \nKazan had trade relations with Moscow, Crimea, Turkey and other regions.\n\n\n=== Russian Tsardom period ===\n\nAs a result of the Siege of Kazan in 1552, Tsar Ivan the Terrible conquered the city and massacred the majority of the population. During the subsequent governorship of Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky, most of the Kazan's Tatar residents were forcibly Christianized or deported, the Kerashen Tatars. Mosques and palaces were ruined. The surviving Tatar population was moved to a place 50 kilometers (31 mi) away from the city and this place was forcibly settled by Russian farmers and soldiers. Tatars in the Russian service were settled in the Tatar Bist\u00e4se settlement near the city's wall. Later Tatar merchants and handicraft masters also settled there. During this period, Kazan was largely destroyed as a result of several great fires. After one of them in 1579, the icon Our Lady of Kazan was discovered in the city.\nIn the early 17th century, at the beginning of the Time of Troubles in Russia, the Tsardom of Kazan declared independence under the leadership of voyvoda Nikanor Shulgin with the help of the Russian population, but this independence was suppressed by Kuzma Minin in 1612.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire period ===\n\nIn 1708, the Tsardom of Kazan was abolished, and Kazan became the seat of Kazan Governorate. After Peter the Great's visit, the city became a center of shipbuilding for the Caspian fleet.

From the inside, the northern side of the fortress to the Spasskaya Tower adjoined the gate to Spasskaya Church, which has now merged with the tower. The typical Pskovian architectural elements of the facade face the main street of the Kremlin. At the end of the 17th century, instead of three tiers, the tower was built with two brick eight-sided tiers with a brick roof, getting its present, familiar appearance. Until 1917, the tower was crowned with the double-headed coat of arms of the Russian state. In the 18th century, a ringing clock was installed in the upper tier, and even earlier a large bell was moved from a small belfry (now lost, located on the castle wall on the left side of the tower). Until the middle of the 19th century, there was a moat with a stone bridge in front of the tower.\nThe South-Western Tower was built simultaneously with the Spasskaya tower by Pskov masters and is a classic example of the Pskov style of defensive structures.\nThe name of the Transfiguration Tower comes from the Transfiguration Monastery of the Savior, which was fenced from the north-west. The tower was also built by Pskov architects Postnik and Barma, but it was significantly rebuilt later, as it has strong traces of the architectural influence of the Moscow defensive architecture. The territory from the Transfiguration Tower to the Spasskaya pass was added to the old Khan's fortress by Pskov masters.\nThere are unnamed round brick towers, presumably built by Moscow architects in the 17th century.\nThe Tainitskaya Tower was built in its present form in the 1550s by Postnik Yakovlev. It was named after a secret source from which it was possible to take water during a siege. The entrance to the tower is in the form of a \"knee\", which increased the defense of the Kremlin. It replaced a tower from the time of the khanate, Nur Ali (in Russian transcription Muraleeva). The 22-year-old Tsar Ivan the Terrible entered the conquered city through the Nur Ali tower.\nThe North-Eastern Round Tower was demolished after the Pugachev's assault.\nThe Consistor Tower was built in brick by Moscow architects in the 17th century, its name was given in the 18th century from the Spiritual Consistory located near the tower in the Kremlin. Near the tower, archaeological excavations revealed the so-called Tezitsky (Arabic for \"merchant\") Moat, which went from the Consistor Tower to the Transfiguration. Archaeologist N. Kalinin and a number of scientists believed that the moat was the southern border of the Khan's fortress.\nThe Southeast Round Tower is an example of Pskov architecture of the 16th century.\n\n\n=== Bist\u00e4, or Posad ===\nCentral Kazan is divided into two districts by the Bolaq canal and Lake Qaban.

Nearly 100,000 citizens resettled by this programme.\n\n\n=== Other major buildings ===\nAnother significant building in central Kazan is the former \"Smolentzev and Shmelev\" tea house and hotel, now the Shalyapin Palace Hotel. It is located at 7/80 Universitetskaya Street, at the corner of Universitetskaya and Bauman. A major landmark of late-19th and early-20th century commercial architecture, it consists of two portions. The original portion, built for a merchant named Usmanov in the 1860s, was bought by the inter-related families of Efim Smolentzev and Pavel and Nikolai Shmelev in 1899. They operated a store selling, among other things, tea. In 1910, the Smolentevs and Shmelevs constructed another portion, designed by architect Vasili Trifonov, and operated a hotel there.

He was also the Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012.\nPutin was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) and studied law at Leningrad State University, graduating in 1975. Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. He later moved to Moscow in 1996 to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin, serving first as Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB's successor agency, before being appointed as prime minister in August 1999. After the resignation of Yeltsin, Putin immediately became acting president, and less than four months later was elected outright to his first term as president.\nDuring his first tenure as president, the Russian economy grew for eight straight years, with GDP measured by purchasing power increasing by 72%. The growth was a result of the 2000s commodities boom, recovery from the post-Communist depression and financial crises, and prudent economic and fiscal policies. After serving as prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev from 2008 to 2012, Putin announced he would seek a third term as president and won the March 2012 election with 64% of the vote. Falling oil prices coupled with international sanctions imposed at the beginning of 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Eastern Ukraine led to GDP shrinking by 3.7% in 2015, though the Russian economy rebounded in 2016 with 0.3% GDP growth, and the recession officially ended. Putin gained 76% of the March 2018 election vote and was re-elected for a six-year term that will end in 2024.\nUnder Putin's leadership, Russia has experienced democratic backsliding. Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing jailing of political opponents, curtailed press freedom, and the lack of free and fair elections.  Russia has scored poorly on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and Freedom House's Freedom in the World index (including a record low 20/100 rating in the 2017 Freedom in the World report, a rating not given since the time of the Soviet Union). Human rights organizations and activists accuse Putin of persecuting political critics and activists as well as ordering them tortured or assassinated; he has rejected accusations of human rights abuses. Officials of the United States government have accused him of leading an interference program against Hillary Clinton in support of Donald Trump during the U.S. presidential election in 2016, an allegation which both Trump and Putin have frequently denied and criticized.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg), the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911\u20131999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (n\u00e9e Shelomova; 1911\u20131998). Vladimir Spiridonovich's father was a cook to Vladimir Lenin. Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers, Viktor and Albert, born in the mid-1930s. Albert died in infancy and Viktor died of diphtheria during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II. Putin's mother was a factory worker and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. Early in World War II, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD. Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942. Putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared from the war front.On 1 September 1960, Putin started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, near his home. He was one of a few in the class of approximately 45 pupils who was not yet a member of the Young Pioneer organization. At age 12, he began to practice sambo and judo. He is a Judo black belt and national master of sports in Sambo. He wished to emulate the intelligence officers portrayed in Soviet cinema. Putin studied German at Saint Petersburg High School 281 and speaks German fluently.Putin studied Law at the Leningrad State University (now Saint Petersburg State University) in 1970 and graduated in 1975. His thesis was on \"The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law\". While there, he was required to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and remained a member until it ceased to exist (it was outlawed in August 1991). Putin met Anatoly Sobchak, an assistant professor who taught business law, was co-author of the Russian constitution, and who would be influential in Putin's career.\n\n\n== KGB career ==\n\nIn 1975, Putin joined the KGB and trained at the 401st KGB school in Okhta, Leningrad. After training, he worked in the Second Chief Directorate (counter-intelligence), before he was transferred to the First Chief Directorate, where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad. In September 1984, Putin was sent to Moscow for further training at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute. From 1985 to 1990 he served in Dresden, East Germany, using a cover identity as a translator. Masha Gessen, a Russian-American who has authored a biography about Putin, claims \"Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB\". According to a later anonymous source cited by journalist Catherine Belton, Putin was personally involved in Soviet support for the West German terrorist Red Army Faction during this time. According to Putin's official biography, during the fall of the Berlin Wall that began on 9 November 1989, he supposedly burned KGB files to prevent demonstrators from obtaining them.After the collapse of the Communist East German government, Putin returned to Leningrad in early 1990, where he worked for about three months with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University, reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov. There, he looked for new KGB recruits, watched the student body, and renewed his friendship with his former professor, Anatoly Sobchak, soon to be the Mayor of Leningrad. Putin claims that he resigned with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 20 August 1991, on the second day of the 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt against the Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Putin said: \"As soon as the coup began, I immediately decided which side I was on\", although he also noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with \"the organs\".In 1999, Putin described communism as \"a blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilization\".\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== 1990\u20131996: Saint Petersburg administration ===\n\nIn May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the Mayor of Leningrad Anatoly Sobchak. In a 2017 interview with Oliver Stone, Putin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration.On 28 June 1991, he became head of the Committee for External Relations of the Mayor's Office, with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments and registering business ventures. Within a year, Putin was investigated by the city legislative council led by Marina Salye. It was concluded that he had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93 million in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived. Despite the investigators' recommendation that Putin be fired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996. From 1994 to 1996, he held several other political and governmental positions in Saint Petersburg.In March 1994, Putin was appointed as First Deputy Chairman of the Government of Saint Petersburg. In May 1995, he organized the Saint Petersburg branch of the pro-government Our Home \u2013 Russia political party, the liberal party of power founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. In 1995, he managed the legislative election campaign for that party, and from 1995 through June 1997, he was the leader of its Saint Petersburg branch.\n\n\n=== 1996\u20131999: Early Moscow career ===\nIn June 1996, Sobchak lost his bid for reelection in Saint Petersburg, so Putin moved to Moscow and was appointed as Deputy Chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by Pavel Borodin. He occupied this position until March 1997. During his tenure, Putin was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and Communist Party to the Russian Federation.\n\nOn 26 March 1997, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of Presidential Staff, which he remained until May 1998, and chief of the Main Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department (until June 1998). His predecessor on this position was Alexei Kudrin and the successor was Nikolai Patrushev, both future prominent politicians and Putin's associates.On 27 June 1997, at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, guided by rector Vladimir Litvinenko, Putin defended his Candidate of Science dissertation in economics, titled \"The Strategic Planning of Regional Resources Under the Formation of Market Relations\". This exemplified the custom in Russia for a rising young official to write a scholarly work in mid-career. When Putin later became president, the dissertation became a target of plagiarism accusations by fellows at the Brookings Institution; although the dissertation was referenced, the Brookings fellows asserted that it constituted plagiarism albeit perhaps unintentional. The dissertation committee denied the accusations.On 25 May 1998, Putin was appointed First Deputy Chief of Presidential Staff for regions, replacing Viktoriya Mitina; and, on 15 July, he was appointed head of the commission for the preparation of agreements on the delimitation of power of regions and the federal center attached to the president, replacing Sergey Shakhray. After Putin's appointment, the commission completed no such agreements, although during Shakhray's term as the Head of the Commission 46 agreements were signed. Later, after becoming president, Putin canceled all those agreements.On 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Putin as Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the primary intelligence and security organization of the Russian Federation and the successor to the KGB.\n\n\n=== 1999: First premiership ===\n\nOn 9 August 1999, Putin was appointed one of three First Deputy Prime Ministers, and later on that day, was appointed acting Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation by President Yeltsin. Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Later on that same day, Putin agreed to run for the presidency.On 16 August, the State Duma approved his appointment as Prime Minister with 233 votes in favor (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained), while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth PM in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin, Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet was determined by the presidential administration.Yeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin's emergence as a potential successor. Following the Russian apartment bombings, Putin's law-and-order image and unrelenting approach to the Second Chechen War against the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals.\nWhile not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to the newly formed Unity Party, which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the December 1999 Duma elections, and in turn supported Putin.\n\n\n=== 1999\u20132000: Acting presidency ===\n\nOn 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the Constitution of Russia, Putin became Acting President of the Russian Federation. On assuming this role, Putin went on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in Chechnya.The first Presidential Decree that Putin signed, on 31 December 1999, was titled \"On guarantees for former president of the Russian Federation and members of his family\". This ensured that \"corruption charges against the outgoing President and his relatives\" would not be pursued. This was most notably targeted at the Mabetex bribery case in which Yeltsin's family members were involved. On 30 August 2000, a criminal investigation (number 18/238278-95) was dropped in which Putin himself was one of the suspects as a member of the Saint Petersburg city government. On 30 December 2000, yet another case against the prosecutor general was dropped \"for lack of evidence\", in spite of thousands of documents passed by Swiss prosecution. On 12 February 2001, Putin signed a similar federal law which replaced the decree of 1999. A case regarding Putin's alleged corruption in metal exports from 1992 was brought back by Marina Salye, but she was silenced and forced to leave Saint Petersburg.While his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000, Yeltsin's resignation resulted in the presidential elections being held within three months, on 26 March 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132004: First presidential term ===\n\nThe inauguration of President Putin occurred on 7 May 2000. Putin appointed the Minister of Finance, Mikhail Kasyanov, as the Prime Minister.\nThe first major challenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the Kursk submarine disaster. That criticism was largely because it was several days before Putin returned from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.Between 2000 and 2004, Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the Russian oligarchs, reaching a 'grand bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for\u2014and alignment with\u2014Putin's government.The Moscow theater hostage crisis occurred in October 2002. Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the deaths of 130 hostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the crisis would severely damage President Putin's popularity. However, shortly after the siege had ended, the Russian president enjoyed record public approval ratings \u2013 83% of Russians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the siege.In 2003, a referendum was held in Chechnya, adopting a new constitution which declares that the Republic of Chechnya is a part of Russia; on the other hand, the region did acquire autonomy. Chechnya has been gradually stabilized with the establishment of the Parliamentary elections and a Regional Government. Throughout the Second Chechen War, Russia severely disabled the Chechen rebel movement; however, sporadic attacks by rebels continued to occur throughout the northern Caucasus.\n\n\n=== 2004\u20132008: Second presidential term ===\n\nOn 14 March 2004, Putin was elected to the presidency for a second term, receiving 71% of the vote. The Beslan school hostage crisis took place in September 2004; more than 330 people died, including 186 children.The near 10-year period prior to the rise of Putin after the dissolution of Soviet rule was a time of upheaval in Russia. In a 2005 Kremlin speech, Putin characterized the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the Twentieth Century.\" Putin elaborated \"Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.\" The country's cradle-to-grave social safety net was gone and life expectancy declined in the period preceding Putin's rule. In 2005, the National Priority Projects were launched to improve Russia's health care, education, housing and agriculture.\n\nThe continued criminal prosecution of Russia's then richest man, President of Yukos oil and gas company Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for fraud and tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin. The government said that Khodorkovsky was \"corrupting\" a large segment of the Duma to prevent changes to the tax code. Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was bankrupted and the company's assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share acquired by the state company Rosneft. The fate of Yukos was seen as a sign of a broader shift of Russia towards a system of state capitalism. This was underscored in July 2014 when shareholders of Yukos were awarded $50 billion in compensation by the Permanent Arbitration Court in The Hague.On 7 October 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who exposed corruption in the Russian army and its conduct in Chechnya, was shot in the lobby of her apartment building, on Putin's birthday. The death of Politkovskaya triggered international criticism, with accusations that Putin had failed to protect the country's new independent media. Putin himself said that her death caused the government more problems than her writings.\n\nIn 2007, \"Dissenters' Marches\" were organized by the opposition group The Other Russia, led by former chess champion Garry Kasparov and national-Bolshevist leader Eduard Limonov. Following prior warnings, demonstrations in several Russian cities were met by police action, which included interfering with the travel of the protesters and the arrests of as many as 150 people who attempted to break through police lines.On 12 September 2007, Putin dissolved the government upon the request of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov. Fradkov commented that it was to give the President a \"free hand\" in the run-up to the parliamentary election. Viktor Zubkov was appointed the new prime minister.In December 2007, United Russia won 64.24% of the popular vote in their run for State Duma according to election preliminary results. United Russia's victory in the December 2007 elections was seen by many as an indication of strong popular support of the then Russian leadership and its policies.\n\n\n=== 2008\u20132012: Second premiership ===\n\nPutin was barred from a third consecutive term by the Constitution. First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was elected his successor. In a power-switching operation on 8 May 2008, only a day after handing the presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia, maintaining his political dominance.\n\nPutin has said that overcoming the consequences of the world economic crisis was one of the two main achievements of his second Premiership. The other was the stabilizing the size of Russia's population between 2008 and 2011 following a long period of demographic collapse that began in the 1990s.At the United Russia Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the Presidency in 2012, an offer Putin accepted. Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming Prime Minister at the end of his presidential term.After the parliamentary elections on 4 December 2011, tens of thousands of Russians engaged in protests against alleged electoral fraud, the largest protests in Putin's time. Protesters criticized Putin and United Russia and demanded annulment of the election results. Those protests sparked the fear of a colour revolution in society. Putin allegedly organized a number of paramilitary groups loyal to himself and to the United Russia party in the period between 2005 and 2012.\n\n\n=== 2012\u20132018: Third presidential term ===\nOn 24 September 2011, while speaking at the United Russia party congress, Medvedev announced that he would recommend the party nominate Putin as its presidential candidate. He also revealed that the two men had long ago cut a deal to allow Putin to run for president in 2012. This switch was termed by many in the media as \"Rokirovka\", the Russian term for the chess move \"castling\". Medvedev said he himself would be ready to perform \"practical work in the government\".On 4 March 2012, Putin won the 2012 Russian presidential elections in the first round, with 63.6% of the vote, despite widespread accusations of vote-rigging. Opposition groups accused Putin and the United Russia party of fraud. While efforts to make the elections transparent were publicized, including the usage of webcams in polling stations, the vote was criticized by the Russian opposition and by international observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for procedural irregularities.\n\nAnti-Putin protests took place during and directly after the presidential campaign. The most notorious protest was the Pussy riot performance on 21 February, and subsequent trial. An estimated 8,000\u201320,000 protesters gathered in Moscow on 6 May, when eighty people were injured in confrontations with police, and 450 were arrested, with another 120 arrests taking place the following day. A counter-protest of Putin supporters occurred which culminated in a gathering of an estimated 130,000 supporters at the Luzhniki Stadium, Russia's largest stadium. Some of the attendees stated that they had been paid to come, were forced to come by their employers, or were misled into believing that they were going to attend a folk festival instead. The rally is considered to be the largest in support of Putin to date.Putin's presidency was inaugurated in the Kremlin on 7 May 2012. On his first day as president, Putin issued 14 Presidential decrees, which are sometimes called the \"May Decrees\" by the media, including a lengthy one stating wide-ranging goals for the Russian economy. Other decrees concerned education, housing, skilled labor training, relations with the European Union, the defense industry, inter-ethnic relations, and other policy areas dealt with in Putin's program articles issued during the presidential campaign.In 2012 and 2013, Putin and the United Russia party backed stricter legislation against the LGBT community, in Saint Petersburg, Archangelsk and Novosibirsk; a law called the Russian gay propaganda law, that is against \"homosexual propaganda\" (which prohibits such symbols as the rainbow flag as well as published works containing homosexual content) was adopted by the State Duma in June 2013. Responding to international concerns about Russia's legislation, Putin asked critics to note that the law was a \"ban on the propaganda of pedophilia and homosexuality\" and he stated that homosexual visitors to the 2014 Winter Olympics should \"leave the children in peace\" but denied there was any \"professional, career or social discrimination\" against homosexuals in Russia.In June 2013, Putin attended a televised rally of the All-Russia People's Front where he was elected head of the movement, which was set up in 2011. According to journalist Steve Rosenberg, the movement is intended to \"reconnect the Kremlin to the Russian people\" and one day, if necessary, replace the increasingly unpopular United Russia party that currently backs Putin.\n\n\n==== Intervention in Ukraine and in Crimea ====\n\nIn 2014, Russia made several military incursions into Ukrainian territory. After the Euromaidan protests and the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. Russia then annexed the Republic of Crimea and City of Sevastopol after a referendum in which Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation, according to official results. Subsequently, demonstrations against Ukrainian Rada legislative actions by pro-Russian groups in the Donbass area of Ukraine escalated into an armed conflict between the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. In August Russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk Oblast. The incursion by the Russian military was seen as responsible for the defeat of Ukrainian forces in early September.\n\nIn November 2014, the Ukrainian military reported intensive movement of troops and equipment from Russia into the separatist-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine. The Associated Press reported 80 unmarked military vehicles on the move in rebel-controlled areas. An OSCE Special Monitoring Mission observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in DPR-controlled territory without insignia. OSCE monitors further stated that they observed vehicles transporting ammunition and soldiers' dead bodies crossing the Russian-Ukrainian border under the guise of humanitarian-aid convoys. As of early August 2015, the OSCE observed over 21 such vehicles marked with the Russian military code for soldiers killed in action. According to The Moscow Times, Russia has tried to intimidate and silence human-rights workers discussing Russian soldiers' deaths in the conflict. The OSCE repeatedly reported that its observers were denied access to the areas controlled by \"combined Russian-separatist forces\".The majority of members of the international community and organizations such as Amnesty International have condemned Russia for its actions in post-revolutionary Ukraine, accusing it of breaking international law and of violating Ukrainian sovereignty. Many countries implemented economic sanctions against Russia, Russian individuals or companies \u2013  to which Russia responded in kind.\n\nIn October 2015, The Washington Post reported that Russia had redeployed some of its elite units from Ukraine to Syria in recent weeks to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In December 2015, Russian Federation President Putin admitted that Russian military intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine.Many members of the international community assumed that Putin's annexation of Crimea had initiated a completely new kind of Russian foreign policy.\nThey took the annexation of Crimea to mean that his foreign policy had shifted \"from state-driven foreign policy\" to taking an offensive stance to re-create the Soviet Union. However, this policy shift can be understood as Putin trying to defend nations in Russia's sphere of influence from encroaching western power. While the act to annex the Crimea was bold and drastic, his \"new\" foreign policy may have more similarities to his older policies.\n\n\n==== Intervention in Syria ====\n\nOn 30 September 2015, President Putin authorized Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, following a formal request by the Syrian government for military help against rebel and jihadist groups.The Russian military activities consisted of air strikes, cruise missile strikes and the use of front line advisors and Russian special forces against militant groups opposed to the Syrian government, including the Syrian opposition, as well as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in the Levant), Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham and the Army of Conquest. After Putin's announcement on 14 March 2016 that the mission he had set for the Russian military in Syria had been \"largely accomplished\" and ordered the withdrawal of the \"main part\" of the Russian forces from Syria, Russian forces deployed in Syria continued to actively operate in support of the Syrian government.\n\n\n==== Russia's interference in the US election ====\n\nIn January 2017, a U.S. intelligence community assessment expressed \"high confidence\" that Putin personally ordered an \"influence campaign,\" initially to denigrate Hillary Clinton and to harm her electoral chances and potential presidency, then later developing \"a clear preference\" for Donald Trump. Both Trump and Putin has consistently denied any Russian interference in the U.S. election. The New York Times reported in July 2018 that the CIA had long nurtured a Russian source who eventually rose to a position close to Putin, allowing the source to pass key information in 2016 about Putin's direct involvement. Suspected CIA's mole named as Oleg Smolenkov is now reported to be living in the United States.\n\n\n=== 2018\u2013present: Fourth presidential term ===\n\nPutin won the 2018 presidential election with more than 76% of the vote. His fourth term began on 7 May 2018, which will last until 2024. On the same day, Putin invited Dmitry Medvedev to form a new government. On 15 May 2018, Putin took part in the opening of the movement along the highway section of the Crimean bridge. On 18 May 2018, Putin signed decrees on the composition of the new Government. On 25 May 2018, Putin announced that he would not run for president in 2024, justifying this in compliance with the Russian Constitution. On 14 June 2018, Putin opened the 21st FIFA World Cup, which took place in Russia for the first time.\nIn September 2019, Putin's administration interfered with the results of Russia's nationwide regional elections, and manipulated it by eliminating all candidates in the opposition. The event that was aimed at contributing to the ruling party,  United Russia's victory, also contributed to inciting mass protests for democracy, leading to large-scale arrests and cases of police brutality.On 15 January 2020, Dmitry Medvedev and his entire government resigned after Vladimir Putin's Address to the Federal Assembly. Putin suggested major constitutional amendments prior to his retirement in 2024. At the same time, on behalf of Putin, he continued to exercise his powers until the formation of a new government. The president suggested that Medvedev take the post of Deputy Secretary of the Security Council.On the same day, Putin nominated Mikhail Mishustin, head of the country's Federal Tax Service for the post of Prime Minister. The next day, he was confirmed by the State Duma to the post and appointed Prime Minister by Putin's decree. This was the first time ever that a PM was confirmed without any votes against. On 21 January 2020, Mishustin presented to Vladimir Putin a draft structure of his Cabinet. On the same day, the President signed a decree on the structure of the Cabinet and appointed the proposed Ministers.\n\n\n==== Coronavirus pandemic ====\n\nOn 15 March 2020, Putin instructed to form a Working Group of the State Council to counteract the spread of coronavirus. Putin appointed Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin as the head of the Group.On 22 March 2020, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Putin arranged the Russian army to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy, which was the European country hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.On 24 March 2020, Putin visited a hospital in Moscow's Kommunarka, where patients with coronavirus are kept, where he spoke with them and with doctors. A week later, the chief doctor of the hospital, Denis Protsenko, with whom Putin met, tested positive for coronavirus. Since then, Vladimir Putin began working remotely from his office at Novo-Ogaryovo. He began holding meetings with the government and other officials via video conference. According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin passes daily tests for coronavirus, and his health is not in danger.On 25 March, President Putin announced in a televised address to the nation that the 22 April constitutional referendum would be postponed due to the coronavirus. He added that the next week would be a nationwide paid holiday and urged Russians to stay at home. Putin also announced a list of measures of social protection, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and changes in fiscal policy. Putin announced following measures for microenterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses: deferring tax payments (except Russia's value-added tax) for the next six months, cutting the size of social security contributions in half, deferring social security contributions, deferring loan repayments for the next six months, a six-month moratorium on fines, debt collection, and creditors' applications for bankruptcy of debtor enterprises. Additionally, a new tax on income from large deposits will be introduced in 2021, and the tax on offshores will be increased. On 2 April, Putin again issued an address in which he announced prolongation of the non-working time until 30 April. Putin likened Russia's fight against COVID-19 to Russia's battles with invading Pecheneg and Cuman steppe nomads in the 10th and 11th centuries. On 19 April, Putin declared that \"The situation is under full control\". On 28 April, Putin declared that \"We cannot relax. The situation is still very difficult.\" In a 24 to 27 April Levada poll, 48% of Russian respondents said that they disapproved of Putin's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his strict isolation and lack of leadership during the crisis was widely commented as sign of losing his \"strongman\" image.\n\n\n==== Constitutional referendum and amendments ====\n\nPutin signed an executive order on 3 July 2020 to officially insert amendments into the Russian Constitution, these amendments took effect on 4 July 2020.\n\n\n== Domestic policies ==\n\nPutin's domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical power structure. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree putting the 89 federal subjects of Russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative).\n\nAccording to Stephen White, under the presidency of Putin Russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances. Some commentators have described Putin's administration as a \"sovereign democracy\". According to the proponents of that description (primarily Vladislav Surkov), the government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country. The practice of the system is however characterized by Swedish economist Anders \u00c5slund:\nAfter Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as \"manual management\" as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial stability.\nThe period after 2012 also saw mass protests against the falsification of elections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws.\n\nIn July 2000, according to a law proposed by Putin and approved by the Federal Assembly of Russia, Putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects. In 2004, the direct election of those heads (usually called \"governors\") by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures. This was seen by Putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime. This and other government actions effected under Putin's presidency have been criticised by many independent Russian media outlets and Western commentators as anti-democratic. In 2012, as proposed by Putin's successor, Dmitry Medvedev, the direct election of governors was re-introduced.During his first term in office, Putin opposed some of the Yeltsin-era oligarchs, as well as his political opponents, resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky; other oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and Arkady Rotenberg are friends and allies with Putin.Putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labor, administrative, criminal, commercial and civil procedural law. Under Medvedev's presidency, Putin's government implemented some key reforms in the area of state security, the Russian police reform and the Russian military reform.\n\n\n=== Economic, industrial, and energy policies ===\n\nFueled by the 2000s commodities boom including record high oil prices, under the Putin administration from 2001 to 2007, the economy made real gains of an average 7% per year, making it the 7th largest economy in the world in purchasing power. In 2007, Russia's GDP exceeded that of Russian SFSR in 1990, having recovered from the 1998 financial crisis and the preceding recession in the 1990s. By 2008, Russia's GDP measured by purchasing power increased by 72%.During Putin's first eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production, construction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class. Putin has also been praised for eliminating widespread barter and thus boosting the economy. Inflation remained a problem however.A fund for oil revenue allowed Russia to repay all of the Soviet Union's debts by 2005. Russia joined the World Trade Organization on 22 August 2012.\n\nControl over the economy was increased by placing individuals from the intelligence services and the military in key positions of the Russian economy, including on boards of large companies.\nIn 2005, an industry consolidation programme was launched to bring the main aircraft producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). The aim was to optimize production lines and minimise losses. The UAC is one of Russia's \"national champions\" and comparable to EADS in Europe.A program was introduced with the aim of increasing Russia's share of the European energy market by building submerged gas pipelines bypassing Ukraine and other countries which were often seen as non-reliable transit partners by Russia, especially following the Russia-Ukraine gas disputes of the late 2000s. Russia also undermined the rival Nabucco pipeline project by buying gas from Turkmenistan and redirecting it into Russian pipelines.Russia diversified its export markets by building the Trans-Siberian oil pipeline to support oil exports to China, Japan and Korea, as well as the Sakhalin\u2013Khabarovsk\u2013Vladivostok gas pipeline in the Russian Far East. Russia has also recently built several major oil and gas refineries, plants and ports. Major hydropower plants such as the Bureya Dam and the Boguchany Dam have been constructed, as well as the restoration of the nuclear industry of Russia, with 1 trillion rubles ($42.7 billion) which were allocated from the federal budget to nuclear power and industry development before 2015. Many nuclear power stations and units are currently being constructed by the state corporation Rosatom in Russia and abroad.\n\nA construction program of floating nuclear power plants is intended to provide power to Russian Arctic coastal cities and gas rigs, starting in 2012. The Arctic policy of Russia also includes an offshore oilfield in the Pechora Sea which is expected to start producing in early 2012, with the world's first ice-resistant oil platform and first offshore Arctic platform. In August 2011, Rosneft, a Russian government-operated oil company, signed a deal with ExxonMobil for Arctic oil production.The construction of a pipeline at a cost of $77  billion, to be jointly funded by Russia and China, was signed off on by Putin in Shanghai on 21 May 2014. On completion, in an estimated 4 to 6 years, the pipeline would deliver natural gas from the state-majority-owned Gazprom to China's state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation for the next 30 years, in a deal worth $400bn.In 2014, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Putin their Person of the Year Award for furthering corruption and organized crime.As noted by Russian journalists after the 2018 presidential inauguration, Putin has since 2007 repeatedly predicted that Russia will become \"one of the world's fifth largest economies\" roughly within 10 years from that date; thus far this target has not been achieved.\n\n\n==== 2014 financial crisis and economic downturn ====\nThe ongoing financial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the Russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions against Russia. These events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight. Though it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on Russia's economy.Energy, trade, and finance agreements with China worth $25 billion were signed in October 2014 in an effort to compensate for international sanctions. The following year, a $400 billion 30-year natural gas supply agreement was also signed with China.\n\n\n=== Environmental policy ===\n\nIn 2004, President Putin signed the Kyoto Protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gases. However, Russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and Russia's greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union.Putin personally supervises a number of protection programmes for rare and endangered animals in Russia, such as the Amur tiger, the white whale, the polar bear and the snow leopard.\n\n\n=== Religious policy ===\n\nBuddhism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Islam and Judaism, defined by law as Russia's traditional religions and a part of Russia's historical heritage, enjoyed limited state support in the Putin era. The vast construction and restoration of churches, started in the 1990s, continued under Putin, and the state allowed the teaching of religion in schools (parents are provided with a choice for their children to learn the basics of one of the traditional religions or secular ethics). His approach to religious policy has been characterized as one of support for religious freedoms, but also the attempt to unify different religions under the authority of the state. In 2012, Putin was honored in Bethlehem and a street was named after him.\n\nPutin regularly attends the most important services of the Russian Orthodox Church on the main Orthodox Christian holidays. He established a good relationship with Patriarchs of the Russian Church, the late Alexy II of Moscow and the current Kirill of Moscow. As president, he took an active personal part in promoting the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate, signed 17 May 2007 that restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia after the 80-year schism.Under Putin, the Hasidic FJCR became increasingly influential within the Jewish community, partly due to the influence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with Putin, notably Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich. According to the JTA, Putin is popular amongst the Russian Jewish community, who see him as a force for stability. Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, said Putin \"paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a deep respect\". In 2016, Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, also praised Putin for making Russia \"a country where Jews are welcome\".\n\n\n=== Military development ===\n\nThe resumption of long-distance flights of Russia's strategic bombers was followed by the announcement by Russian Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov during his meeting with Putin on 5 December 2007, that 11 ships, including the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov, would take part in the first major navy sortie into the Mediterranean since Soviet times. The sortie was to be backed up by 47 aircraft, including strategic bombers.While from the early 2000s Russia started placing more money into its military and defense industry, it was only in 2008 that the full-scale Russian military reform began, aiming to modernize the Russian Armed Forces and making them significantly more effective. The reform was largely carried out by Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov during Medvedev's presidency, under the supervision of both Putin, as the Head of Government, and Medvedev, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces.\nKey elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million; reducing the number of officers; centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres; creating a professional NCO corps; reducing the size of the central command; introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff; elimination of cadre-strength formations; reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an air base system instead of regiments.The number of Russia's military districts was reduced to four. The term of draft service was reduced from two years to one, which put an end to the old harassment traditions in Russian army, since all conscripts became very close by draft age. The gradual transition to the majority professional army by the late 2010s was announced, and a large programme of supplying the Armed Forces with new military equipment and ships was started. The Russian Space Forces were replaced on 1 December 2011 with the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces.\nIn spite of Putin's call for major investments in strategic nuclear weapons, these will fall well below the New START limits due to the retirement of aging systems. After U.S. President George W. Bush withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Putin responded by ordering a build-up of Russia's nuclear capabilities, designed to counterbalance U.S. capabilities. Most analysts agree that Russia's nuclear strategy under Putin eventually brought it into violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Because of this, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would no longer consider itself bound by the treaty's provisions, raising nuclear tensions between the two powers. This prompted Putin to state that Russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but would \"annihilate\" any adversary. Russians killed in such a conflict \"will go to heaven as martyrs\". Most military analysts believe Russia would consider launching first if losing a major conventional conflict as part of an 'escalate to de-escalate' strategy that would bring adversaries to the negotiating table.Putin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic and its military presence here. In August 2007, Russian expedition Arktika 2007, part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial extension claim, planted a flag on the seabed below the North Pole. Both Russian submarines and troops deployed in the Arctic have been increasing.\n\n\n=== Human rights policy ===\n\nAn NGO based in the New York City; Human Rights Watch; in a report entitled Laws of Attrition, authored by Hugh Williamson, the British director of HRW's Europe & Central Asia Division, has claimed that since May 2012, when Putin was re-elected as president, Russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started inspections of nongovernmental organizations, harassed, intimidated, and imprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. The new laws include the \"foreign agents\" law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by including Russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent. Human rights activists have criticized Russia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to \"the gay propaganda law\" and increasing violence against LGBT+ people due to the law. Putin has rejected accusations of human rights abuses.\n\n\n=== The media ===\n\nScott Gehlbach, an American Professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, has claimed that since 1999, Putin has reportedly punished journalists who challenge his official point of view. Maria Lipman, an American writing in Foreign Affairs (the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations), claims, \"The crackdown that followed Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media, which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently.\" The Internet has attracted Putin's attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information. Marian K. Leighton, who worked for the CIA as a Soviet analyst in the 1980s says, \"Having muzzled Russia's print and broadcast media, Putin focused his energies on the Internet.\" Robert W. Orttung and Christopher Walker report:\n\nReporters Without Borders, for instance, ranked Russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in terms of freedom of the press. It particularly criticized Russia for the crackdown on the political opposition and the failure of the authorities to vigorously pursue and bring to justice criminals who have murdered journalists. Freedom House ranks Russian media as \"not free\", indicating that basic safeguards and guarantees for journalists and media enterprises are absent.In the early 2000s, Putin and others in his government began promoting the idea in Russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century Romanov tsars who ended Russia's \"Time of Troubles\", meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Promoting conservatism ===\n\nPutin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and neo-liberalism and is identified by scholars with Russian conservatism. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist Alexander Prokhanov, stresses (i) Russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies. Vladislav Surkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key economics consultants during Putin's presidency.In cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like \"a miracle of God.\" Steven Myers reports, \"The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state.\"Mark Woods, a Baptist minister and contributing editor to Christian Today, provides specific examples of how the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. More broadly, The New York Times reports in September 2016 how the Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:\n\n\"A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women's and gay rights. \"\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\n\nIn 2007, Putin led a successful effort on behalf of Sochi (located along the Black Sea near the border between Georgia and Russia) for the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics, the first Winter Olympic Games to ever be hosted by Russia. Likewise, in 2008, the city of Kazan won the bid for the 2013 Summer Universiade, and on 2 December 2010 Russia won the right to host the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup, also for the first time in Russian history. In 2013, Putin stated that gay athletes would not face any discrimination at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\n\n=== Wildlife protection and conservation ===\nPutin is chairman of the Russian Geographical Society's board of trustees and is actively engaged in the protection of rare species. The programs are being conducted by the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n== Foreign policy ==\n\nPutin spoke favorably of Artificial Intelligence in regards to foreign policy, \u201cArtificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind.  It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict.  Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d\n\n\n=== South and East Asia ===\n\nIn 2012, Putin wrote an article in the Hindu newspaper, saying that \"The Declaration on Strategic Partnership between India and Russia signed in October 2000 became a truly historic step\". Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during Putin's 2012 visit to India: \"President Putin is a valued friend of India and the original architect of the India-Russia strategic partnership\".Putin's Russia maintains positive relations with other BRIC countries. The country has sought to strengthen ties especially with the People's Republic of China by signing the Treaty of Friendship as well as building the Trans-Siberian oil pipeline and Trans-Siberian gas pipeline geared toward growing Chinese energy needs. The mutual-security cooperation of the two countries and their central Asian neighbours is facilitated by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) which was founded in 2001 in Shanghai by the leaders of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.The announcement made during the SCO summit that Russia resumes on a permanent basis the long-distance patrol flights of its strategic bombers (suspended in 1992) in the light of joint Russian-Chinese military exercises, first-ever in history held on Russian territory, made some experts believe that Putin is inclined to set up an anti-NATO bloc or the Asian version of OPEC. When presented with the suggestion that \"Western observers are already likening the SCO to a military organization that would stand in opposition to NATO\", Putin answered that \"this kind of comparison is inappropriate in both form and substance\".\n\n\n=== Post-Soviet states ===\n\nA series of so-called colour revolutions in the post-Soviet states, namely the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004, Putin criticized the Rose and Orange revolutions, saying: \"If you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict\".\n \nA number of economic disputes erupted between Russia and some neighbors, such as the Russian import ban of Georgian wine. And in some cases, such as the Russia\u2013Ukraine gas disputes, the economic conflicts affected other European countries, for example when a January 2009 gas dispute with Ukraine led state-controlled Russian company Gazprom to halt its deliveries of natural gas to Ukraine, which left a number of European states, to which Ukraine transits Russian gas, with serious shortages of natural gas in January 2009.The plans of Georgia and Ukraine to become members of NATO have caused some tensions between Russia and those states. In 2010, Ukraine did abandon these plans. Putin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO Russia could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea. At the summit, he told US President George W. Bush that \"Ukraine is not even a state!\" while the following year Putin referred to Ukraine as \"Little Russia\". Following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution in March 2014, the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. According to Putin, this was done because \"Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia\". After the Russian annexion of Crimea, he said that Ukraine includes \"regions of Russia's historic south\" and \"was created on a whim by the Bolsheviks\". He went on to declare that the February 2014 ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had been orchestrated by the West as an attempt to weaken Russia. \"Our Western partners have crossed a line. They behaved rudely, irresponsibly and unprofessionally,\" he said, adding that the people who had come to power in Ukraine were \"nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites\". In a July 2014 speech midst an armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine, Putin stated he would use Russia's \"entire arsenal\" and \"the right of self defence\" to protect Russian speakers outside Russia. With the split of the Ukrainian orthodox church from the Russian one in 2018, a number of experts came to the conclusion that Putin's policy of forceful engagement in post-Soviet republics significantly backfired on him, leading to a situation where he \"annexed Crimea, but lost Ukraine\", and provoked a much more cautious approach to Russia among other post-Soviet countries.\n\nIn late August 2014, Putin stated: \"People who have their own views on history and the history of our country may argue with me, but it seems to me that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one people\". After making a similar statement, in late December 2015 he stated: \"the Ukrainian culture, as well as Ukrainian literature, surely has a source of its own\".\n\nIn August 2008, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili attempted to restore control over the breakaway South Ossetia. However, the Georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting 2008 South Ossetia War after regular Russian forces entered South Ossetia and then Georgia proper, then also opened a second front in the other Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia with Abkhazian forces.Despite existing or past tensions between Russia and most of the post-Soviet states, Putin has followed the policy of Eurasian integration. Putin endorsed the idea of a Eurasian Union in 2011; the concept was proposed by the President of Kazakhstan in 1994. On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement setting a target of establishing the Eurasian Union by 2015. The Eurasian Union was established on 1 January 2015.\n\n\n=== United States, Europe, and NATO ===\n\nUnder Putin, Russia's relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages. When he first became president, relations were cautious, but after the 9/11 attacks Putin quickly supported the U.S. in the War on Terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared. However, the U.S. responded by further expansion of NATO to Russia's borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.From 2003, when Russia did not support the Iraq War and when Putin became ever more distant from the West in his internal and external policies, relations continued to deteriorate. According to Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen, the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media, following that of the White House, became anti-Putin. In an interview with Michael St\u00fcrmer, Putin said there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely, the status of Kosovo, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and suggested that all three were linked. His view was that concessions by the West on one of the questions might be met with concessions from Russia on another.In a January 2007 interview, Putin said Russia was in favor of a democratic multipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law.In February 2007, Putin criticized what he called the United States' monopolistic dominance in global relations, and \"almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations\". He said the result of it is that \"no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race\". This came to be known as the Munich Speech, and former NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called the speech \"disappointing and not helpful.\" The months following Putin's Munich Speech were marked by tension and a surge in rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic. Both Russian and American officials, however, denied the idea of a new Cold War.\nPutin publicly opposed plans for the U.S. missile shield in Europe and presented President George W. Bush with a counterproposal on 7 June 2007 which was declined. Russia suspended its participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty on 11 December 2007.Putin opposed Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence, warning supporters of that precedent that it would de facto destabilize the whole system of international relations.\n\nPutin had good relations with former American President George W. Bush, and many European leaders. His \"cooler\" and \"more business-like\" relationship with Germany's current chancellor, Angela Merkel is often attributed to Merkel's upbringing in the former DDR, where Putin was stationed as a KGB agent. He had a very friendly and warm relationship with the former Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi; the two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship, continuing to organize bilateral meetings even after Berlusconi's resignation in November 2011.In late 2013, Russian-American relations deteriorated further when the United States canceled a summit (for the first time since 1960) after Putin gave asylum to Edward Snowden, who had leaked classified information from the NSA.Relations were further strained after the 2014\u201315 Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the Annexation of Crimea.In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 group as a result of its annexation of Crimea. However, in June 2015, Putin told an Italian newspaper that Russia has no intention of attacking NATO.\n\nOn 9 November 2016, Putin congratulated Donald Trump on becoming the 45th President of the United States.In December 2016, US intelligence officials (headed by James Clapper) quoted by CBS News stated that Putin approved the email hacking and cyber attacks during the U.S. election, against the democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A spokesman for Putin denied the reports. Putin has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton, who served as U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, of interfering in Russia's internal affairs, and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin of having a personal grudge against her.\n\nWith the election of Trump, Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased. A Gallup poll in February 2017 revealed a positive view of Putin among 22% of Americans, the highest since 2003. However, Putin has stated that U.S.\u2013Russian relations, already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have continued to deteriorate after Trump took office in January 2017.On 18 June 2020, The National Interest published a nine thousand words essay by Putin, titled 'The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II'. In the essay, Putin criticizes the western historical view of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact as the start of World War II, stating that the Munich Agreement was the beginning.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn 2003, relations between Russia and the United Kingdom deteriorated when the United Kingdom granted political asylum to Putin's former patron, oligarch Boris Berezovsky. This deterioration was intensified by allegations that the British were spying and making secret payments to pro-democracy and human rights groups.\n\n\n==== Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko ====\n\nThe end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by polonium poisoning of former KGB and FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London, who became an MI6 agent in 2003. In 2007, the crisis in relations continued with expulsion of four Russian envoys over Russia's refusal to extradite former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi to face charges in the murder of Litvinenko. Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and took other retaliatory steps.In 2015\u201316, the British Government conducted an inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Its report was released in January 2016. According to the report, \"The FSB operation to kill Mr Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev and also by President Putin.\" The report outlined some possible motives for the murder, including Litvinenko's public statements and books about the alleged involvement of the FSB in mass murder, and what was \"undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism\" between Putin and Litvinenko, led to the murder. Media analyst William Dunkerley, writing in The Guardian, criticised the inquiry as politically motivated, biased, lacking in evidence, and logically inconsistent. The Kremlin dismissed the Inquiry as \"a joke\" and \"whitewash\".Poisoning of Sergei Skripal\n\nOn 4 March 2018, former double agent Sergei Skripal was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury. 10 days later, the British government formally accused the Russian state of attempted murder, a charge which Russia denied. After the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats (an action which would later be responded to with a Russian expulsion of 23 British diplomats), British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on 16 March that it was \"overwhelmingly likely\" Putin had personally ordered the poisoning of Skripal. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegation \"shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct\".\n\n\n=== Australia and Latin America ===\n\nPutin and his successor, Medvedev, enjoyed warm relations with the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela. Much of this has been through the sale of military equipment; since 2005, Venezuela has purchased more than $4 billion worth of arms from Russia. In September 2008, Russia sent Tupolev Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela to carry out training flights. In November 2008, both countries held a joint naval exercise in the Caribbean. Earlier in 2000, Putin had re-established stronger ties with Fidel Castro's Cuba.In September 2007, Putin visited Indonesia and in doing so became the first Russian leader to visit the country in more than 50 years. In the same month, Putin also attended the APEC meeting held in Sydney where he met with John Howard, who was the Australian Prime Minister at the time, and signed a uranium trade deal for Australia to sell uranium to Russia. This was the first visit by a Russian president to Australia.\n\n\n=== Middle East and North Africa ===\n\nOn 16 October 2007, Putin visited Iran to participate in the Second Caspian Summit in Tehran, where he met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This was the first visit of a Soviet or Russian leader to Iran since Joseph Stalin's participation in the Tehran Conference in 1943, and thus marked a significant event in Iran-Russia relations. At a press conference after the summit Putin said that \"all our (Caspian) states have the right to develop their peaceful nuclear programmes without any restrictions\".\n\nSubsequently, under Medvedev's presidency, Iran-Russia relations were uneven: Russia did not fulfill the contract of selling to Iran the S-300, one of the most potent anti-aircraft missile systems currently existing. However, Russian specialists completed the construction of Iran and the Middle East's first civilian nuclear power facility, the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, and Russia has continuously opposed the imposition of economic sanctions on Iran by the U.S. and the EU, as well as warning against a military attack on Iran. Putin was quoted as describing Iran as a \"partner\", though he expressed concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme.In April 2008, Putin became the first Russian President who visited Libya. Putin condemned the foreign military intervention of Libya, he called UN resolution as \"defective and flawed,\" and added \"It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades.\" Upon the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Putin called it as \"planned murder\" by the US, saying: \"They showed to the whole world how he (Gaddafi) was killed,\" and \"There was blood all over. Is that what they call a democracy?\"\n\nRegarding Syria, from 2000 to 2010 Russia sold around $1.5 billion worth of arms to that country, making Damascus Moscow's seventh-largest client.\nDuring the Syrian civil war, Russia threatened to veto any sanctions against the Syrian government, and continued to supply arms to the regime.\nPutin opposed any foreign intervention. In June 2012, in Paris, he rejected the statement of French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande who called on Bashar Al-Assad to step down. Putin echoed Assad's argument that anti-regime militants were responsible for much of the bloodshed. He also talked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked \"What is happening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading? Nobody has an answer\".On 11 September 2013, The New York Times published an op-ed by Putin urging caution against US intervention in Syria and criticizing American exceptionalism. Putin subsequently helped to arrange for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons. In 2015, he took a stronger pro-Assad stance and mobilized military support for the regime. Some analysts have summarized Putin as being allied with Shiites and Alawites in the Middle East.In October 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the United Arab Emirates, where six agreements were struck with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. One of them included shared investments between Russian sovereign wealth fund and the Emirati investment fund Mubadala. The two nations signed deals worth over $1.3bn, in energy, health and advance technology sectors.Stephen Kotkin, a professor at Princeton University, says that Russia's high-tech industry is dependent on Israel. \"Russia's hemorrhage of human capital has not helped. How many \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Russia form a part of Israel's high tech sector is hard to say [...] many Russian-born engineers in Israel could only find employment as service workers, housemaids, and welders. Either way, they do not work in Russia.\"\n\n\n=== BRICS Summit ===\n\nPresident Putin has attended the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) Summit conferences since 2013.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\n\n=== Polls and rankings ===\nAccording to a June 2007 public opinion survey, Putin's approval rating was 81%, the second highest of any leader in the world that year. In January 2013, at the time of 2011\u20132013 Russian protests, Putin's approval rating fell to 62%, the lowest figure since 2000 and a ten-point drop over two years. By May 2014, following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and annexation of Crimea, Putin's approval rating had rebounded to 85.9%, a six-year high.After EU and U.S. sanctions against Russian officials as a result of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, Putin's approval rating reached 87 percent, according to a Levada Center survey published on 6 August 2014. In February 2015, based on new domestic polling, Putin was ranked the world's most popular politician. In June 2015, Putin's approval rating climbed to 89%, an all-time high. In 2016, the approval rating was 81%.Observers saw Putin's high approval ratings in 2010's as a consequence of significant improvements in living standards, and Russia's reassertion of itself on the world scene during his presidency.Despite high approval for Putin, confidence in the Russian economy was low, dropping to levels in 2016 that rivaled the recent lows in 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis. Just 14% of Russians in 2016 said their national economy was getting better, and 18% said this about their local economies. Putin's performance at reining in corruption is also unpopular among Russians. Newsweek reported in June 2017 that \"An opinion poll by the Moscow-based Levada Center indicated that 67 percent held Putin personally responsible for high-level corruption\".\n\nIn July 2018, Putin's approval rating fell to 63% and just 49% would vote for Putin if presidential elections were held. Levada poll results published in September 2018 showed Putin's personal trustworthiness levels at 39% (decline from 59% in November 2017) with the main contributing factor being the presidential support of the unpopular pension reform and economic stagnation. In October 2018, two-thirds of Russians surveyed in Levada poll agreed that \"Putin bears full responsibility for the problems of the country\" which has been attributed to decline of a popular belief in \"good tsar and bad boyars\", a traditional attitude towards justifying failures of top of ruling hierarchy in Russia.In January 2019, the percentage of Russians trusting the president hit a then-historic minimum \u2013 33.4%. It declined further to 31.7% in May 2019 which led to a dispute between the VCIOM and President's administration office, who accused it of incorrectly using an open question, after which VCIOM repeated the poll with a closed question getting 72.3%. Nonetheless, in April 2019 Gallup poll showed a record number of Russians (20%) willing to permanently emigrate from Russia. The decline is even larger in the 17\u201325 age group, \"who find themselves largely disconnected from the country's aging leadership, nostalgic Soviet rhetoric and nepotistic agenda\", according to a report prepared by Vladimir Milov. The percentage of people willing to emigrate permanently in this age group is 41% and 60% has favorable views on the United States (three times more than in the 55+ age group). Decline in support for president and the government is also visible in other polls, such as rapidly growing readiness to protest against poor living conditions.In November 2019, in a Levada poll, 53% respondents aged 18\u201324 declared they would like to permanently emigrate from Russia. In May 2020, amid the COVID-19 crisis, Putin's approval rating was 67.9%, measured by VCIOM when respondents were presented a list of names, and 27% when respondents were expected to name politicians they trust. In a closed-question survey conducted by Levada, the approval rating was 59% which has been attributed to continued post-Crimea economic stagnation but also an apathetic response to the pandemic crisis in Russia.\n\n\n=== Assessments ===\nCritics state that Putin has moved Russia in an autocratic direction. Putin has been described as a \"dictator\" by political opponent Garry Kasparov, as a \"bully\" and \"arrogant\" by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and as \"self-centered\" and an \"isolationist\" by the Dalai Lama. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West has demonized Putin.Many Russians credit Putin for reviving Russia's fortunes. Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency, said that Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years, and that Russians \"must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a collapse.\" In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a \"raw materials colony\" of China. Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter, Ramzan Kadyrov, states that Putin saved both the Chechen people and Russia.Russia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putin's tenure. Freedom House has listed Russia as being \"not free\" since 2005. Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing purges and jailing of political opponents, curtailed press freedom, and the lack of free and fair elections. In 2004, Freedom House warned that Russia's \"retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country was part of the Soviet Union.\" The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as \"authoritarian\" since 2011, whereas it had previously been considered a \"hybrid regime\" (with \"some form of democratic government\" in place) as late as 2007. According to political scientist, Larry Diamond, writing in 2015, \"no serious scholar would consider Russia today a democracy\".\n\n\n=== Personal image ===\n\nPutin cultivates an outdoor, sporty, tough guy public image, demonstrating his physical prowess and taking part in unusual or dangerous acts, such as extreme sports and interaction with wild animals, part of a public relations approach that, according to Wired, \"deliberately cultivates the macho, take-charge superhero image\". For example, in 2007, the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda published a huge photograph of a shirtless Putin vacationing in the Siberian mountains under the headline: \"Be Like Putin.\" Some of the activities have been criticised for being staged. Outside of Russia, his macho image has been the subject of parody. Putin is believed to be self-conscious about his height, which has been estimated by Kremlin insiders at between 155 cm (5 ft 2 in) and 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall but is usually given at 170 cm (5 ft 7 in).Notable examples of Putin's adventures include flying military jets, practising martial arts, riding horses, rafting, and fishing and swimming in a cold Siberian river, many of which he did shirtless. Other examples are descending in a deep-water submersible, tranquilizing tigers and polar bears, riding a motorbike, co-piloting a firefighting plane to dump water on a raging fire, shooting darts at whales from a crossbow for eco-tracking, driving a race car, scuba diving at an archaeological site, attempting to lead endangered cranes in a motorized hang glider, and catching large fish.There are many songs about Putin. Some of the more well-known ones include \"Go Hard Like Vladimir Putin\" by K. King and Beni Maniaci, \"VVP\" by Tajik singer Tolibjon Kurbankhanov, \"Our Madhouse is Voting for Putin\" by Working Faculty, and \"A Song About Putin\" by the Russian Airborne Troops band. There is also the song \"Putin khuylo!\" which originally emerged as anti-Putin chants by Ukrainian football fans and spread in Ukraine (among supporters of Euromaidan), then to other countries. A song called \"A Man Like Putin\" by Poyushchie vmeste was also a hit across Russia, topping the Russian Music Charts in 2002.Putin's name and image are widely used in advertisement and product branding. Among the Putin-branded products are Putinka vodka, the PuTin brand of canned food, the Gorbusha Putina caviar, and a collection of T-shirts with his image. In 2015, his advisor was found dead after days of excessive consumption of alcohol, though this was later ruled an accident.\n\n\n=== Publication recognition in the United States ===\nIn 2007, he was the Time Person of the Year. In 2015, he was No. 1 on the Time's Most Influential People List. Forbes ranked him the World's Most Powerful Individual every year from 2013 to 2016. He was ranked the second most powerful individual by Forbes in 2018, only behind China's paramount leader Xi Jinping.\n\n\n=== Putinisms ===\n\nPutin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms. Many of them were first made during his annual Q&A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language, often alluding to Russian jokes and folk sayings.Putin sometimes uses Russian criminal jargon (fenya), albeit not always correctly.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Family ===\n\nOn 28 July 1983, Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and they lived together in East Germany from 1985 to 1990. They have two daughters, Mariya Putina, born 28 April 1985 in Leningrad, and Yekaterina Putina, born 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany.In April 2008, the Moskovsky Korrespondent reported that Putin had divorced Shkrebneva and was engaged to marry rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabaeva. The story was denied and the newspaper was shut down shortly thereafter. Putin and Shkrebneva continued to make public appearances together as spouses, while the status of his relationship with Kabaeva became a topic of speculation. In the subsequent years, there were frequent reports that Putin and Kabaeva had multiple children together, although these reports were denied. In 2015, Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to a daughter; Putin is alleged to be the father.On 6 June 2013, Putin and Shkrebneva announced that their marriage was over, and, on 1 April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been finalized.Putin has two grandsons, born in 2012 and 2017.His cousin, Igor Putin, was a director at Moscow based Master Bank and was accused in a number of money laundering scandals.\n\n\n=== Personal wealth ===\n\nOfficial figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put Putin's wealth at approximately 3.7 million rubles (US$150,000) in bank accounts, a private 77.4-square-meter (833 sq ft) apartment in Saint Petersburg, and miscellaneous other assets. Putin's reported 2006 income totaled 2 million rubles (approximately $80,000). In 2012, Putin reported an income of 3.6 million rubles ($113,000).Putin has been photographed wearing a number of expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six times his annual salary. Putin has been known on occasion to give watches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts to peasants and factory workers.According to Russian opposition politicians and journalists, Putin secretly possesses a multi-billion dollar fortune via successive ownership of stakes in a number of Russian companies. According to one editorial in The Washington Post, \"Putin might not technically own these 43 aircraft, but, as the sole political power in Russia, he can act like they're his\". Russian RIA journalist argued that \"[Western] intelligence agencies (...) could not find anything\". These contradictory claims were analyzed by Polygraph.info which looked at a number of reports by Western (Anders \u00c5slund estimate of $100\u2013160 billion) and Russian (Stanislav Belkovsky estimated of $40 billion) analysts, CIA (estimate of $40 billion in 2007) as well as counterarguments of Russian media. Polygraph concluded:\n\nThere is uncertainty on the precise sum of Putin's wealth, and the assessment by the Director of U.S. National Intelligence apparently is not yet complete. However, with the pile of evidence and documents in the Panama Papers and in the hands of independent investigators such as those cited by Dawisha, Polygraph.info finds that Danilov's claim that Western intelligence agencies have not been able to find evidence of Putin's wealth to be misleading\nIn April 2016, 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were leaked to the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The name of Vladimir Putin does not appear in any of the records, and Putin denied his involvement with the company. However, various media have reported on three of Putin's associates on the list. According to the Panama Papers leak, close trustees of Putin own offshore companies worth US$2 billion in total. The German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung regards the possibility of Putin's family profiting from this money as plausible.\n\nAccording to the paper, the US$2 billion had been \"secretly shuffled through banks and shadow companies linked to Putin's associates\", such as construction billionaires Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, and Bank Rossiya, previously identified by the U.S. State Department as being treated by Putin as his personal bank account, had been central in facilitating this. It concludes that \"Putin has shown he is willing to take aggressive steps to maintain secrecy and protect [such] communal assets.\" A significant proportion of the money trail leads to Putin's best friend Sergei Roldugin. Although a musician, and in his own words, not a businessman, it appears he has accumulated assets valued at $100m, and possibly more. It has been suggested he was picked for the role because of his low profile. There have been speculations that Putin, in fact, owns the funds, and Roldugin just acted as a proxy. Putin himself denied it, and his press-secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the leak was a conspiracy aimed at Putin.\n\n\n=== Residences ===\n\n\n==== Official government residences ====\n\nAs president and prime-minister, Putin has lived in numerous official residences throughout the country. These residences include: the Moscow Kremlin, Novo-Ogaryovo in Moscow Oblast, the White House in Moscow, Gorki-9 near Moscow, Bocharov Ruchey in Sochi, Dolgiye Borody in Novgorod Oblast, and Riviera in Sochi.In August 2012, critics of President Vladimir Putin listed the ownership of 20 villas and palaces, nine of which were built during Putin's 12 years in power.\n\n\n==== Personal residences ====\nSoon after Putin returned from his KGB service in Dresden, East Germany, he built a dacha in Solovyovka on the eastern shore of Lake Komsomolskoye on the Karelian Isthmus in Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast, near St. Petersburg. After the dacha burned down in 1996, Putin built a new one identical to the original and was joined by a group of seven friends who built dachas nearby. In 1996, the group formally registered their fraternity as a co-operative society, calling it Ozero (\"Lake\") and turning it into a gated community.A massive Italianate-style mansion costing an alleged US$1 billion and dubbed \"Putin's Palace\" is under construction near the Black Sea village of Praskoveevka. The mansion, built on government land and sporting 3 helipads, and a private road paid for from state funds and guarded by officials wearing uniforms of the official Kremlin guard service, is said to have been built for Putin's private use. In 2012, Sergei Kolesnikov, a former business associate of Putin's, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he had been ordered by Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to oversee the building of the palace. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed Kolesnikov's allegations against Putin as untrue, saying that \"Putin has never had any relationship to this palace.\"\n\n\n=== Pets ===\n\nPutin's female black Labrador Retriever Konni was often seen at the President's side, and was sometimes allowed to attend meetings when Putin greeted world leaders during their visits to Russia.\nPutin has four dogs, Buffy, Yume, Verni and Pasha. Buffy, a Karakachan dog, was given to President Putin in November 2010 by the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov. Yume is an Akita Inu dog which arrived in Moscow in July 2012 as a three-month-old puppy as the Akita Prefecture's gift to show gratitude for Russia's assistance to Japan after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011.\nVerni, which is an Alabai \u2013 a Turkmen-bred variety of the Central Asia shepherd dog \u2013 was a birthday gift from the leader of Turkmenistan during a meeting in Sochi in October 2017. Putin received Pasha, a \u0160arplaninac puppy as a gift from Serbia during his state visit in January 2019.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nPutin is Russian Orthodox. His mother was a devoted Christian believer who attended the Russian Orthodox Church, while his father was an atheist. Though his mother kept no icons at home, she attended church regularly, despite government persecution of her religion at that time. His mother secretly baptized him as a baby, and she regularly took him to services.According to Putin, his religious awakening began after a serious car crash involving his wife in 1993, and a life-threatening fire that burned down their dacha in August 1996. Shortly before an official visit to Israel, Putin's mother gave him his baptismal cross, telling him to get it blessed. Putin states, \"I did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have never taken it off since.\" When asked in 2007 whether he believes in God, he responded, \"... There are things I believe, which should not in my position, at least, be shared with the public at large for everybody's consumption because that would look like self-advertising or a political striptease.\" Putin's rumoured confessor is Russian Orthodox Bishop Tikhon Shevkunov.\nHowever, the sincerity of his Christianity has been rejected by his former advisor Sergei Pugachev.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nPutin is frequently seen promoting sports\u2014including skiing, badminton, cycling, and fishing\u2014and a healthy lifestyle among Russians.Putin watches football and supports FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. He displays an interest in ice hockey and bandy.Putin began training in sambo at the age of fourteen, before switching to judo, which he continues to practice. Putin won competitions in both sports in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). Putin was awarded eighth dan of the black belt in 2012, becoming the first Russian to achieve the status. Putin also practises karate.Putin co-authored a book entitled Judo with Vladimir Putin in Russian, and Judo: History, Theory, Practice in English (2004). Benjamin Wittes, a black belt in taekwondo and aikido and editor of Lawfare, has disputed Putin's martial arts skills, stating that there is no video evidence of Putin displaying any actual noteworthy judo skills.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Civilian awards presented by different countries ===\n\n\n=== Honorary doctorates ===\n\n\n=== Other awards ===\n\n\n=== Recognition ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nArutunyan, Anna (2015) [2012; Czech ed.].

        "brit": "Bulgar, also called Bulgarian,  member of a people known in eastern European history during the Middle Ages. A branch of this people was one of the primary three ethnic ancestors of modern Bulgarians (the other two were Thracians and Slavs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More on This Topic\nBulgaria: Arrival of the Bulgars\nThe name Bulgaria comes from the Bulgars, a people who are still a matter of academic dispute with respect...\n\n\n\nAlthough many scholars, including linguists, had posited that the Bulgars were derived from a Turkic tribe of Central Asia (perhaps with Iranian elements), modern genetic research points to an affiliation with western Eurasian and European populations. Early Bulgars inhabited the European steppe west of the Volga River from about 370 ce. Retreating with the Huns, they resettled about 460 in an arc of country north and east of the Sea of Azov. Hired by the Byzantines in 480 to fight against the Ostrogoths, the Bulgars subsequently became attracted by the wealth of the Byzantine Empire. In the 6th century the Bulgars continually attacked the Danubian provinces of the Byzantine Empire until, in the 560s, they were themselves threatened by the Avars, who were then advancing from Asia into central Europe. The Avars destroyed one Bulgar tribe, but the rest saved themselves by submitting, for two decades, to another horde of Turkic newcomers, most of whom then retreated back into Asia.Unified under a single ruler, Kurt, or Kubrat (reigned c. 605\u2013c. 642), the Bulgars constituted a powerful polity known to the Byzantines as Great Bulgaria, with the Kuban River as its southern frontier. After Kurt\u2019s death his five sons split the people into five hordes. One of these five, remaining on the coast of the Sea of Azov, was absorbed into the new empire of the Khazars, another migrated to central Europe and was merged with the Avars, and another disappeared into service under the Lombards in Italy. Two of the five hordes, however, had longer futures.Kurt\u2019s son Kotrag avoided the Khazars by leading his horde far to the north, where it eventually occupied an ill-defined country around the confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers. Subdivided there into three groups (probably through mergers with indigenous peoples or with other immigrants), the horde maintained itself in prosperity for some 600 years. These Volga Bulgars formed not so much a state as a seminomadic confederation, but they had two cities, Bulgar and Suvar, which profited as transshipment points in the trade between the fur-selling Ugrians and Russians of the far north and the southern civilizations\u2014Byzantium, the Muslim caliphate of Baghdad, and Turkistan. The Volga Bulgars were converted to Islam about 922. In 1237 they were made subject to the Mongol Golden Horde, and, though the city of Bulgar flourished for a long time afterward, the people gradually lost their identity and were mingled with the Russians.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nThe fifth product of the breakup of Great Bulgaria was the horde that Kurt\u2019s son Asparukh led westward across the Dniester River and then southward across the Danube. There, on the plain between the Danube and the Balkan Mountains, they established the kernel of the so-called first Bulgarian empire\u2014the state from which the modern nation of Bulgaria derives its name. In the 7th century the Danubian region was nominally controlled by the Byzantine Empire, and it was inhabited by Vlachs (ancestors of the modern Romanians) and also very largely by recently arrived Slavs. In 681 the first Bulgarian empire was officially founded and recognized by the Byzantine Empire. Asparukh\u2019s successor, Tervel (701\u2013718), helped to restore Emperor Justinian II to the Byzantine throne in 705 and was rewarded with the title \u201ccaesar.\u201d In 717\u2013718 Tervel and a Bulgarian army joined with the Byzantine emperor Leo III to launch a massive offensive against an Arab army invading Constantinople (now Istanbul). The Bulgarian army defeated the Arabs and successfully defended the city.The conquering Bulgars were soon permeated by Vlach and, even more thoroughly, by Slavic elements. At the same time, their conquests were carrying them deeper into the ambit of Byzantine Christianity. Territorial expansion into Serbia and Macedonia under Krum (khan 803\u2013814) and under Pressian (836\u2013852) was followed by the conversion of the Bulgars to Christianity under Boris I. The new church\u2019s liturgy was in the language known as Old Bulgarian (Old Church Slavonic), which was a composite of Bulgar and Slav linguistic elements. It proved to be a powerful agent in creating a common culture among the Bulgars and Slavs. By the time Bulgaria was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire early in the 11th century, the Bulgars and Slavs had melded into a Slavic-speaking, Christianized people essentially identical to today\u2019s Bulgarians.Boris I\u2019s son Simeon I, who was acknowledged as tsar, or emperor, of the Bulgars, brought the first empire to its acme as a Balkan power, even though he had to give up the lands north of the Danube to fresh invaders from the Eurasian steppe. As invasions of the Balkan Peninsula from the north continued intermittently over the next four centuries, the Turkic element in the Bulgarians\u2019 ethnic makeup was reinforced by strains derived from the Pechenegs, Kipchaks, and Cumans\u2014all Turkic peoples. In this period Bulgaria became a cultural centre of eastern Europe, especially famous for its literary schools of Preslav (now Veliki Preslav) and Ohrid.After Simeon\u2019s death the first Bulgarian empire was undermined by internal divisions and invasions of Magyars, Pechenegs, Rus, and Byzantines. In 1018 Bulgaria was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire. An anti-Byzantine revolt of the Balkan peoples in 1185 produced the second Bulgarian empire, and by 1241 the Bulgarian tsars of the house of Asen (1185\u20131280) were supreme in most of the lands from the Danube River to the Aegean Sea and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea. But Mongol attacks from the north, Serbian encroachment on the west, and internal rivalry among the successors of the Asens eroded this second empire, and in 1396 it fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were overrunning the Balkans from the south.Throughout the long period of direct Ottoman rule (1396\u20131878), the Bulgarians\u2019 obstinate Christianity prevented their being merged completely with the Muslim Turks, while their retention of a Slavic language kept them from absorption by the Greeks predominant in the Eastern Orthodox Church as recognized by the Ottomans. In 1878 an autonomous Bulgarian principality under Ottoman suzerainty was established. Bulgaria was declared independent, as a tsardom or kingdom, in 1908. ",

        "wiki": "Elia Kazan (; born Elias Kazantzoglou (Greek: \u0397\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03cc\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5); September 7, 1909 \u2013 September 28, 2003) was a Greek-American director, producer, writer and actor, described by The New York Times as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history\".He was born in Istanbul, to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including City for Conquest (1940).His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was Gentleman's Agreement (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by Pinky, one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received twelve Oscar nominations, winning four, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's East of Eden, which introduced James Dean to movie audiences.\nA turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong.\" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses.\" Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous.\" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film A Letter to Elia as a personal tribute to Kazan.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nElia Kazan was born in the Fener district of Istanbul, to Cappadocian Greek parents originally from Kayseri in Anatolia. He arrived with his parents, George and Athena Kazantzoglou (n\u00e9e Shishmanoglou), to the United States on 8 July 1913. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Elia Kazantzoglou. His maternal grandfather was Isaak Shishmanoglou. Elia's brother, Avraam, was born in Berlin and later became a psychiatrist.Kazan was raised in the Greek Orthodox religion and attended Greek Orthodox services every Sunday, where he had to stand for several hours with his father. His mother read the Bible but did not go to church. When Kazan was about eight years old, the family moved to New Rochelle, New York, and his father sent him to a Roman Catholic catechism school because there was no Orthodox church nearby.\n\nAs a young boy, he was remembered as being shy, and his college classmates described him as more of a loner. Much of his early life was portrayed in his autobiographical book, America America, which he made into a film in 1963. In it, he describes his family as \"alienated\" from both their parents' Greek Orthodox values and from those of mainstream America. His mother's family were cotton merchants who imported cotton from England and sold it wholesale.  His father had become a rug merchant after emigrating to the United States and expected that his son would go into the same business.After attending public schools through high school, Kazan enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he helped pay his way by waiting tables and washing dishes; he still graduated cum laude. He also worked as a bartender at various fraternities, but never joined one. While a student at Williams, he earned the nickname \"Gadg,\" for Gadget, because, he said, \"I was small, compact, and handy to have around.\" The nickname was eventually taken up by his stage and film stars.\nIn America America he tells how, and why, his family left Turkey and moved to America. Kazan notes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that \"it's all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to Istanbul ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances ... It's also true that he lost the money on the way, and when he got there he swept rugs in a little store.\"Kazan notes some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film. He writes \"I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas.\" To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan's uncle Avraam kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:\n\nI hesitated about that for a long time. A lot of people, who don't understand how desperate people can get, advised me to cut it. When I am accused of being excessive by the critics, they're talking about moments like that. But I wouldn't take it out for the world. It actually happened. Believe me, if a Turk could get out of Turkey and come here, even now, he would kiss the ground. To oppressed people, America is still a dream.\nBefore undertaking the film, Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family's background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a \"deeper question: 'Why America? What were you hoping for?'\" His mother gave him the answer, however: \"A.E. brought us here.\" Kazan states that \"A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey. At twenty-eight, somehow\u2014this was the wonder\u2014he made his way to New York. He sent home money and in time brought my father over. Father sent for my mother and my baby brother and me when I was four.\nKazan writes of the movie, \"It's my favorite of all the films I've made; the first film that was entirely mine.\"\n\n\n== Stage career ==\n\n\n=== Group Theatre ===\n\nIn 1932, after spending two years at the Yale University School of Drama, he moved to New York City to become a professional stage actor. He continued his professional studies at the Juilliard School where he studied singing with Lucia Dunham. His first opportunity came with a small group of actors engaged in presenting plays containing \"social commentary\". They were called the Group Theatre, which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages. After struggling to be accepted by them, he discovered his first strong sense of self in America within the \"family of the Group Theatre, and more loosely in the radical social and cultural movements of the time,\" writes film author Joanna E. Rapf.In Kazan's autobiography, he writes of the \"lasting impact on him of the Group,\" noting in particular, Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman as \"father figures\", along with his close friendship with playwright Clifford Odets. Kazan, during an interview with Michel Ciment, describes the Group:\n\nThe Group was the best thing professionally that ever happened to me. I met two wonderful men. Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman, both of whom were around thirty years old. They were magnetic, fearless leaders. During the summer I was an apprentice, they were entertaining in a Jewish summer camp ... At the end of the summer they said to me: \"You may have talent for something, but it's certainly not acting.\"Kazan, in his autobiography, also describes Strasberg as a vital leader of the group:\n\nHe carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home ... [H]e was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them permanent.Kazan's first national success came as a New York theatrical director. Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Group's most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by Clifford Odets, Waiting for Lefty, and his performance was called \"dynamic,\" leading some to describe him as the \"proletarian thunderbolt.\"Among the themes that would run through all of his work were \"personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice\", writes film critic William Baer. Other critics have likewise noted his \"strong commitment to the social and social psychological\u2014rather than the purely political\u2014implications of drama\".By the mid-1930s, when he was 26, he began directing a number of the Group Theatre's plays, including Robert Ardrey's well-known play Thunder Rock. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by Thornton Wilder, The Skin of Our Teeth, starring Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a Pulitzer Prize. Kazan won the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller, and then directed A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams, both of which were also successful. Kazan's wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a \"prize that launched his career.\"The Group Theatre's summer rehearsal headquarters was at Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, during the 1930s and early 1940s. Along with Kazan were numerous other artists: Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Luise Rainer, Frances Farmer, Will Geer, Howard Da Silva, Clifford Odets, Lee J. Cobb and Irwin Shaw.\n\n\n=== Actors Studio ===\nIn 1947, he founded the Actors Studio, a non-profit workshop, with actors Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford. In 1951, Lee Strasberg became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the \"Method\" to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of Konstantin Stanislavski's teachings. The \"Method\" school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.\nAmong Strasberg's students were Montgomery Clift, Mildred Dunnock, Julie Harris, Karl Malden, Patricia Neal, Maureen Stapleton, Eli Wallach, and James Whitmore. \nKazan directed two of the Studio's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Karl Malden and Marlon Brando, in the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nThough at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films, but his first feature film was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed Gentleman's Agreement, where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in America, antisemitism, for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1949 he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed Pinky, which dealt with issues of racism in America, and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.\nIn 1947, he directed the courtroom drama Boomerang!, and in 1950 he directed Panic in the Streets, starring Richard Widmark, in a thriller shot on the streets of New Orleans. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in \"energizing\" the action scenes. He won the Venice Film Festival International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that Zero Mostel also act in the film, despite Mostel being \"blacklisted\" as a result of HUAC testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:\n\nEach director has a favorite in his cast, ... my favorite this time was Zero Mostel ... I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I'd ever met ... I constantly sought his company ... He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the \"industry's\" blacklist ... For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.\nIn 1951, after introducing and directing Marlon Brando and Karl Malden in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, A Streetcar Named Desire, which won 4 Oscars, being nominated for 12.\nDespite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater, though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, but he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:\n\nOn \"Streetcar\" we worked very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I actually did was to make the set smaller. As the story progressed ... the set got smaller and smaller.Kazan's next film was Viva Zapata! (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his \"first real film\" because of those factors.In 1954 he again used Brando as a star in On the Waterfront.  As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York's longshoremen's union. It too was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, and won 8, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, for Marlon Brando.\nOn the Waterfront was also the screen debut for Eva Marie Saint, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:\n\nI ended up crying. Crying and laughing ... I mean there was such an attraction there ... That smile of his ... He was very tender and funny ... And Kazan, in his genius, saw the chemistry there.\nLife magazine described On the Waterfront as the \"most brutal movie of the year\" but with \"the year's tenderest love scenes,\" and stating that Saint was a \"new discovery\" in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in On the Waterfront that she \"starts her real trip to fame.\"The film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer Leonard Bernstein.\n\nAfter the success of On the Waterfront, he went on to direct another screen adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel, East of Eden (1955). As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, James Dean. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag. The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), directed by Kazan's friend Nicholas Ray, and then Giant (1956), directed by George Stevens.\nAuthor Douglas Rathgeb describes the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he \"kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.\" As a result, Kazan was forced to \"baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers,\" so he wouldn't run away during production. Co-star Julie Harris worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that \"his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears.\"\nDean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director Nicholas Ray to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in Rebel Without a Cause. Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen; but it didn't seem possible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. \"Dean himself did not seem to believe it,\" notes Rathgeb. \"He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.\"The film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car outside of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was East of Eden.\nIn 1961, he introduced Warren Beatty in his first screen appearance with a starring role in Splendor in the Grass (1961), with Natalie Wood; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author Peter Biskind points out that Kazan \"was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.\" Biskind notes also that they \"were wildly dissimilar\u2014mentor vs. prot\u00e9g\u00e9, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.\"  Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:\n\nWarren\u2014it was obvious the first time I saw him\u2014wanted it all and wanted it his way. Why not? He had the energy, a very keen intelligence, and more chutzpah than any Jew I've ever known. Even more than me. Bright as they come, intrepid, and with that thing all women secretly respect: complete confidence in his sexual powers, confidence so great that he never had to advertise himself, even by hints.Biskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: \"The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HUAC. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something\u2014why did you name all those names?'\"Beatty recalled the episode: \"In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.\" Biskind describes how \"Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.\" Beatty, years later, during a Kennedy Center tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan \"had given him the most important break in his career.\"Beatty's costar, Natalie Wood, was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer Suzanne Finstad notes that a \"turning point\" in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film A Streetcar Named Desire: \"She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie.\" In 1961, after a \"series of bad films, her career was already in decline,\" notes Rathgeb. Kazan writes that the \"sages\" of the film community declared her as \"washed up\" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:\n\nWhen I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J., I said to myself. I liked Bob Wagner, I still do.Kazan cast her as the female lead in Splendor in the Grass, and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, \"working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on Splendor.\" She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of \"Kazan's wizardry ...  produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.\"Actor Gary Lockwood, who also acted in the film, felt that \"Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.\" Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). \"It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,\" writes Kazan. \"And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.\"\n\n\n=== Screenwriters ===\nKazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Inge; in film, he worked again with Willams (A Streetcar Named Desire and Baby Doll), Inge (Splendor in the Grass), Budd Schulberg (On the Waterfront and A Face in the Crowd), John Steinbeck (Viva Zapata!), and Harold Pinter (The Last Tycoon). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, \"he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.\" In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond, was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.Williams became one of Kazan's closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of \"creative slumps\" by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, \"Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.\"Among Kazan's other films were Panic in the Streets (1950), East of Eden (1955), Baby Doll (1956), Wild River (1960), and The Last Tycoon (1976).\n\n\n== Literary career ==\nIn between his directing work he wrote four best-selling novels, including America America and The Arrangement, both of which tell the story of Kazan's Greek immigrant ancestors. Both novels were later made into films.\n\n\n== Directing style ==\n\n\n=== Preference for unknown actors ===\nKazan strove for \"cinematic realism,\" a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict \"social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity.\" He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie's ultimate success or failure. As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as Lee Remick, Jo Van Fleet, Warren Beatty, Andy Griffith, James Dean, and Jack Palance, their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer George Stevens, Jr. that he felt that \"big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits ... they're not pliable anymore.\" Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:\nNow what I try to do is get to know them very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human material is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.Kazan goes on to describe how he got to understand James Dean, as an example:\n\nWhen I met him he said, \"I'll take you for a ride on my motorbike ...\" It was his way of communicating with me, saying \"I hope you like me, ...\" I thought he was an extreme grotesque of a boy, a twisted boy. As I got to know his father, as I got to know about his family, I learned that he had been, in fact, twisted by the denial of love ... I went to Jack Warner and told him I wanted to use an absolutely unknown boy. Jack was a crapshooter of the first order, and said, \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\n=== Topics of personal and social realism ===\nKazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:\n\nI don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life. I start with an instinct. With East of Eden ... it's really the story of my father and me, and I didn't realize it for a long time ... In some subtle or not-so-subtle way, every film is autobiographical. A thing in my life is expressed by the essence of the film. Then I know it experientially, not just mentally. I've got to feel that it's in some way about me, some way about my struggles, some way about my pain, my hopes.Film historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on \"reality\", although his style was not defined as \"naturalistic.\" She adds: \"He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.\" Kazan states that \"unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him.\"In his later years he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a\n\"collective art,\" as he once believed:\n\nTo be successful it should express the vision, the conviction, and the insistent presence of one person.Film author Peter Biskind described Kazan's career as \"fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work.\" Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:\n\nI don't think basically I'm a political animal. I think I'm a self-centered animal ... I think what I was concerned about all my life was to say something artistically that was uniquely my own.Nonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, written by screenwriter Budd Schulberg, which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.\" Another political film was A Face in the Crowd (1957). His protagonist, played by Andy Griffith (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn \"of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation.\" Kazan states, \"Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package.\"\n\n\n=== Use of \"Method\" acting ===\nAs a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of \"Method\" actors, especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, \"I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance including so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends ... The director is a desperate beast! ... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.\" Actor Robert De Niro called him a \"master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting.\"Kazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:\n\nI don't have great range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The classics are beyond me ... I am a mediocre director except when a play or film touches a part of my life's experience ... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors ... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.He explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:\n\nWhen I talk to the actors they begin to give me ideas, and I grab them because the ideas they give me turn them on. I want the breath of life from them rather than the mechanical fulfillment of the movement which I asked for ... I love actors. I used to be an actor for eight years, so I do appreciate their job.Kazan, however, held strong ideas about the scenes and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in Baby Doll, for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker, he privately asked Wallach, \"Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?\" Wallach writes, \"I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered ... 'No.'\" Kazan replies, \"Good idea, play it that way.\" Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:\n\nWhat is erotic about sex to me is the seduction, not the act ... The scene on the swings (Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker) in Baby Doll is my exact idea of what eroticism in films should be.\n\n\n=== Being an \"actor's director\" ===\nJoanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director Nicholas Ray considered him \"the best actor's director the United States has ever produced.\" Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that \"he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method ... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism.\"Among the actors who describe Kazan as an important influence in their career were Patricia Neal, who co-starred with Andy Griffith in A Face in the Crowd (1957): \"He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.\" Anthony Franciosa, a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:\n\nHe would always say, 'Let me see what you can do. Let me see it. Don't talk to me about it.' You felt that you had a man who was completely on your side\u2014no qualms about anything you did. He gave you a tremendous sense of confidence ... He never made me feel as though I was acting for the camera. Many times, I never even knew where the camera was.However, in order to get quality acting from Andy Griffith, in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls \"an astonishing movie debut,\" Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: \"I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.\"Actress Terry Moore calls Kazan her \"best friend,\" and notes that \"he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life.\" \"He would find out if your life was like the character,\" says Carroll Baker, star of Baby Doll, \"he was the best director with actors.\"Kazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, The Last Tycoon (1976). He remembers that Robert De Niro, the star of the film, \"would do almost anything to succeed,\" and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro \"is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.\"The powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal character traits.  Although he didn't know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, \"Bobby is more meticulous ... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.\" Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film. Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that \"for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather, part II, ... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest.\"Marlon Brando, in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:\n\nI have worked with many movie directors\u2014some good, some fair, some terrible. Kazan was the best actors' director by far of any I've worked for ... the only one who ever really stimulated me, got into a part with me and virtually acted it with me ... he chose good actors, encouraged them to improvise, and then improvised on the improvisation ... He gave his cast freedom and ... was always emotionally involved in the process and his instincts were perfect ... I've never seen a director who became as deeply and emotionally involved in a scene as Gadg ... he got so wrought up that he started chewing on his hat.He was an arch-manipulator of actors' feelings, and he was extraordinarily talented; perhaps we will never see his like again.\n\n\n== HUAC testimony ==\n\nKazan testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) in 1952, during the postwar era that journalist Michael Mills, calls \"arguably the most controversial period in Hollywood history.\" When Kazan was in his mid-20s, during the Depression years 1934 to 1936, he had been a member of the American Communist Party in New York, for a year and a half.\nIn April 1952, the Committee called on Kazan, under oath, to identify Communists from that period 16 years earlier. Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former Group Theatre members who he said had been Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller, who later married Lee Strasberg. He testified that Odets quit the party at the same time that he did. All the persons named were already known to HUAC, however. The move cost Kazan many friends within the film industry, including playwright Arthur Miller.Kazan would later write in his autobiography of the \"warrior pleasure at withstanding his 'enemies.\"\nWhen Kazan received an Honorary Academy Award in 1999, the audience was noticeably divided in their reaction, with some including Nick Nolte, Ed Harris, Ian McKellen, and Amy Madigan refusing to applaud, and many others, such as actors Kathy Bates, Meryl Streep, Karl Malden, and Warren Beatty, and producer George Stevens, Jr. standing and applauding. Stevens speculates on why he, Beatty, and many others in the audience chose to stand and applaud:\n\nI never discussed it with Warren, but I believe we were both standing for the same reason\u2014out of regard for the creativity, the stamina and the many fierce battles and lonely nights that had gone into the man's twenty motion pictures.Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan agreed, writing \"The only criterion for an award like this is the work\". Kazan was already \"denied accolades\" from the American Film Institute, and other film critics' associations. According to Mills, \"It's time for the Academy to recognize this genius,\" adding that \"We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour.\" In response, former vice president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Joseph McBride, claimed that an honorary award recognizes \"the totality of what he represents, and Kazan's career, post 1952, was built on the ruin of other people's careers.\"In later interviews, Kazan explained some of the early events that made him decide to become a friendly witness, most notably in relation to the Group Theatre, which he called his first \"family,\" and the \"best thing professionally\" that ever happened to him:\n\nThe Group Theatre said that we shouldn't be committed to any fixed political program set by other people outside the organization. I was behaving treacherously to the Group when I met downtown at CP [Communist Party] headquarters, to decide among the Communists what we should do in the Group, and then come back and present a united front, pretending we had not been in caucus ...\nI was tried by the Party and that was one of the reasons I became so embittered later. The trial was on the issue of my refusal to follow instructions, that we should strike in the Group Theatre, and insist that the membership have control of its organization. I said it was an artistic organization, and I backed up Clurman and Strasberg who were not Communists ... The trial left an indelible impression on me ... Everybody else voted against me and they stigmatized me and condemned my acts and attitude. They were asking for confession and self-humbling. I went home that night and told my wife \"I am resigning.\" But for years after I resigned, I was still faithful to their way of thinking. I still believed in it. But not in the American Communists. I used to make a difference and think: \"These people here are damned fools but in Russia they have got the real thing,\" until I learned about the Hitler-Stalin pact, and gave up on the USSR.Mills notes that prior to becoming a \"friendly witness,\" Kazan discussed the issues with Miller:\n\nTo defend a secrecy I don't think right and to defend people who have already been named or soon would be by someone else ... I hate the Communists and have for many years, and don't feel right about giving up my career to defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I believe in, but not this.Miller put his arm around Kazan and retorted, \"Don't worry about what I'll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place.\"In his memoirs, Kazan writes that his testimony meant that \"the big shot had become the outsider.\" He also notes that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, Tennessee Williams, with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams \"the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nElia Kazan was married three times. His first wife was playwright Molly Day Thacher. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons, including screenwriter Nicholas Kazan. His second marriage, to the actress Barbara Loden, lasted from 1967 until her death in 1980, and produced one son. His marriage, in 1982, to Frances Rudge continued until his death, in 2003, aged 94.\nIn 1978, the U.S. government paid for Kazan and his family to travel to Kazan's birthplace where many of his films were to be shown. During a speech in Athens, he discussed his films and his personal and business life in the U.S., along with the messages he tried to convey:\n\nIn my own view, the solution is to talk about human beings and not about abstracts, to reveal the culture and the social moment as it is reflected in the behavior and the lives of individual people. Not to be \"correct.\" To be total. So I do not believe in any ideology that does not permit\u2014no encourage\u2014the freedom of the individual.\nHe also offered his opinions about the role of the U.S. as a world model for democracy:\n\nI think you and I, all of us, have some sort of stake in the United States. If it fails, the failure will be that of us all. Of mankind itself. It will cost us all.  ... I think of the United States as a country which is an arena and in that arena there is a drama being played out.  ... I have seen that the struggle is the struggle of free men.\nElia Kazan died from natural causes in his Manhattan apartment, September 28, 2003, aged 94.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nIn addition to these awards, Kazan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located on 6800 Hollywood Boulevard. He is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.Directed Academy Award Performances\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nKazan became known as an \"actor's director\" because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars. Under his direction, his actors received 24 Academy Award nominations and won nine Oscars.\nHe won as Best Director for Gentleman's Agreement (1947) and for On the Waterfront (1954). Both A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront were nominated for twelve Academy Awards, respectively winning four and eight.\n\nWith his many years with the Group Theatre and Actors Studio in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous \"for the power and intensity of his actors' performances.\" He was the pivotal figure in launching the film careers of Marlon Brando, James Dean, Julie Harris, Eli Wallach, Eva Marie Saint, Warren Beatty, Lee Remick, Karl Malden, and many others. Seven of Kazan's films won a total of 20 Academy Awards. Dustin Hoffman commented that he \"doubted whether he, Robert De Niro, or Al Pacino, would have become actors without Mr. Kazan's influence.\"Upon his death, at the age of 94, the New York Times described him as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history.\" The Death of a Salesman and A Streetcar Named Desire, two plays he directed, are considered to be some of the greatest of the 20th century. Although he became a respected director on Broadway, he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major film directors of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career \"he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations\", adding that \"he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema\". Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.His controversial stand during his testimony in front of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, became the low point in his career, although he remained convinced that he made the right decision to give the names of Communist Party members. He stated in an interview in 1976 that \"I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did, and betray my own soul. I didn't betray it. I made a difficult decision.\"During his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for directing on stage and screen. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for lifetime achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who wrote On the Waterfront, thanked his lifelong friend saying, \"Elia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.\"In 1999, at the 71st Academy Awards, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro presented the Honorary Oscar to Kazan. This would be a controversial pick for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences due to Kazan's past history regarding his involvement with the Hollywood Blacklist in the 1950s. Several members of the audience including Nick Nolte and Ed Harris refused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such as Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, and Kurt Russell gave him a standing ovation.Martin Scorsese has directed a film documentary, A Letter to Elia  (2010), considered to be an \"intensely personal and deeply moving tribute\" to Kazan. Scorsese was \"captivated\" by Kazan's films as a young man, and the documentary mirrors his own life story while he also credits Kazan as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker. It won a Peabody Award in 2010.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKazan, Elia (1962). America America. New York: Popular Library. OCLC 21378773.\nKazan, Elia (1967). The Arrangement: A Novel.

        "wiki": "Cube is a 1997 Canadian independent science-fiction horror film directed and co-written by Vincenzo Natali. A product of the Canadian Film Centre's First Feature Project, Nicole de Boer, Nicky Guadagni, David Hewlett, Andrew Miller, Julian Richings, Wayne Robson and Maurice Dean Wint star as individuals trapped in the titular cube as they cross industrialized cube-shaped rooms, some rigged with various traps designed to kill.\nCube has gained notoriety and a cult following, for its surreal atmosphere and Kafkaesque setting and concept of industrial, cube-shaped rooms. The film received generally positive reviews, and was followed by a sequel in 2002 and a prequel in 2004, both of which were negatively received. A remake, currently on hold, is in development at Lionsgate.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a man named Alderson is killed in a mysterious cube-shaped room, five strangers \u2013 Quentin, Worth, Holloway, Leaven, and Rennes \u2013 awaken and meet in another identical room. No one knows where they are or how they got there. Quentin informs the group that some rooms contain traps, which he discovered while exploring. Rennes, a convict who has escaped seven prisons, assumes each trap is triggered by a motion detector and tests each room by throwing one of his boots in first. The maze is beset by frequent tremors, and Leaven notices numbers inscribed in the narrow passageways between rooms. Rennes enters a room that he assumes to be safe and is killed when he is sprayed with acid, indicating that each trap uses different sensors to trigger them.\nQuentin believes each person was chosen to be there: He is a divorced police officer, Leaven is a young mathematics student, and Holloway is a free clinic doctor, while the surly Worth says he is only an office worker. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a prime number is a trap, and they find a mentally challenged man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. Quentin injures his leg in a trapped room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, and tensions rise over personal conflicts and the ensuing mystery over the maze's purpose. After being provoked by Quentin, Worth finally admits that he designed the maze's outer shell\u2014in the shape of a gigantic cube\u2014for a shadowy bureaucracy, and guesses that its original purpose has been forgotten; they have been imprisoned within the maze simply to put it to use, otherwise it would only serve to be \"pointless\".\nWorth's knowledge of the outer shell's dimensions allows Leaven to determine that each side of the Cube is 26 rooms across and that there are 17,576 rooms in total. She then guesses that the numbers indicate the Cartesian coordinates of each room. The group moves toward the nearest edge as determined by her theory, but each of the rooms near the outer wall is trapped. Rather than backtrack, they travel silently through a room with a sound-activated trap. After Kazan makes a sound and nearly causes Quentin's death, Quentin threatens Kazan. Holloway defends Kazan, and she and Quentin clash, with Holloway insinuating that Quentin may have been an abusive husband and likes young girls. When they reach the edge, Holloway scouts the darkened gap between the Cube and its outer shell but slips during another violent tremor; Quentin initially saves her but then lets her fall to her death.\nQuentin becomes mentally unhinged; he attempts to persuade Leaven to join him in abandoning the others and makes a sexual advance, but she rejects him. Worth intervenes, but Quentin beats him savagely and drops him into another room through a floor hatch. There, the group finds Rennes' corpse and are demoralized by the thought of having wandered in circles. Worth then realizes that the rooms move periodically throughout the Cube, which is the cause of all the tremors. Leaven also deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers, but by powers of prime numbers, and Kazan reveals himself to be an autistic savant who can quickly do prime factorizations mentally. With Kazan's help, Leaven guides the group to the bridge room that will lead them out of the maze. Worth ambushes and seemingly kills Quentin before leaving him behind. Kazan opens the final hatch, revealing a bright white light, but Worth declines to leave the Cube as he has completely lost his will to live.\nAs Leaven tries to convince Worth to join her, Quentin reappears, stabs and kills her with a hatch lever, and mortally wounds Worth while Kazan flees. As Quentin moves to kill Kazan, Worth grabs Quentin's leg and pins him in the narrow passageway as the rooms shift again. Quentin is torn apart, and Worth crawls back to Leaven's corpse to die next to her. Kazan slowly wanders into the bright light.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMaurice Dean Wint as Quentin McNeil, a police officer. He is a gruff and aggressive man who takes charge and undertakes most of the dangerous tasks. He is said to be in his 40s.\nNicole de Boer as Joan Leaven, a young student with mathematical skills. She is said to be in her late teens to early 20s.\nDavid Hewlett as David Worth, a chronic malcontent and cynic who unwittingly designed the outer shell of the Cube. He is said to be in late 20s to early 30s.\nAndrew Miller as Kazan, a mentally handicapped man with the ability to rapidly and accurately perform prime number calculations. He is said to be in his 20s.\nNicky Guadagni as Dr. Helen Holloway, a free clinic doctor and a paranoid conspiracy theorist. She is said to be in her early 50s.\nWayne Robson as Rennes, also known as \"the Wren\", an escape artist who has gotten out of seven prisons. He is said to be in his early 60s.\nJulian Richings as Alderson, a prisoner and a mysterious character. He woke up in another room and never met the rest of the group. He is said to be in his 30s.Each character's name is connected with a real-world prison:\n\n\n== Production ==\nAn episode of the original The Twilight Zone television series, \"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\" (first aired 22 December 1961), was reportedly an inspiration for the film. The film was shot in Toronto, Ontario.\n\n\n=== Script development ===\nThough Vincenzo Natali had the initial inspiration to make a film \"set entirely in hell\" in 1990, it was not until 1994, when he was working as a storyboard artist's assistant at Canada's Nelvana animation studio, that he had completed the first script for Cube. The initial draft had a slightly comedic tone to it, and featured surreal images, a cannibal, edible moss that grew on the walls, and a monster that roamed the cube. Roommate and childhood filmmaking partner Andre Bijelic helped Natali strip the central idea \u2013 people avoiding deadly traps in a maze \u2013 down to its essence. Scenes that took place outside of the cube were jettisoned, and the identity of the victims themselves changed. In some drafts, they were accountants and in others criminals, with the implication being that their banishment to the cube was part of a penal sentence. One of the most important dramatic changes was the complete removal of food and water from the scenario; this created a sense of urgency for escape.After writing Cube, Natali developed and filmed a short entitled Elevated. The short was set in an elevator and was intended to give investors an idea of how Cube would hypothetically look and come across. While working on Elevated, cinematographer Derek Rogers developed strategies for shooting in the tightly confined spaces in which he would later work on Cube. The short eventually helped Cube procure financing. Cube was shot on a Toronto soundstage.\n\n\n=== The Cube design ===\nThe fictional Cube device in the film was conceived by mathematician David W. Pravica, who also served as the film's math consultant. It consists of an outer cubical shell (the sarcophagus) and the inner cube. Each side of the outer shell is 434 feet (132 m) long. The inner cube consists of 263 = 17,576 cubical rooms (minus an unknown number of rooms to allow for movement, as shown in the film), each having a side length of 15.5 feet (4.7 m). There is a space of 15.5 feet (4.7 m) between the inner cube and the outer shell. Each room is labelled with three identification numbers, for example, 517 478 565. These numbers encode the starting coordinates of the room and the X, Y, and Z coordinates are the sums of the digits of the first, second, and third number, respectively. The numbers also determine the movement of the room - the subsequent positions are obtained by cyclically subtracting the digits from one another, and the resulting numbers are then successively added to the starting numbers.Only one cube, with each of its sides measuring 14 feet (4.3 m) in length, was actually built, with only one working door that could actually support the weight of the actors. The colour of the room was changed by sliding panels. Since this was a time-consuming procedure, the movie was not shot in sequence; all shots taking place in rooms of a specific colour were shot one at a time. It was intended that there would be six different colours of rooms to match the recurring theme of six throughout the movie; five sets of gel panels, plus pure white. However, the budget did not stretch to the sixth gel panel, and so there are only five different room colours in the movie. Another partial cube was made for shots requiring the point of view of standing in one room and looking into another.\n\n\n== Release ==\nCube was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 1997. It was released in Ottawa and Montreal on 18 September 1997.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film grossed $501,818 in the United States, and $8,479,845 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $8,981,663.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Cube holds an approval rating of 63%, based on 38 reviews, and an average rating of 6.29/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Cube sometimes struggles with where to take its intriguing premise, but gripping pace and an impressive intelligence make it hard to turn away.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score 61 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle was highly critical of the film, writing, \"If writer-director Vincenzo Natali, storyboard artist for Keanu Reeves's Johnny Mnemonic, were as comfortable with dialogue and dramatizing characters as he is with images, this first feature of his might have worked better.\" Nick Schager from Slant Magazine rated the film three out of five stars, noting that, while the film had an intriguing premise and initially chilling mood; it was undone by threadbare characterizations, and lack of a satisfying explanation for the cube's existence. Schager concluded his review by stating that the film \"eventually winds up going nowhere fast\".Anita Gates of The New York Times was more positive of the film, stating, \"Cube, the story in question, proves surprisingly gripping, in the best Twilight Zone tradition. The ensemble cast does an outstanding job on the cinematic equivalent of a bare stage... Everyone has his or her own theory about who is behind this peculiar imprisonment... The weakness in Cube is the dialogue, which sometimes turns remarkably trite... The strength is the film's understated but real tension. Vincenzo Natali, the film's fledgling director and co-writer, has delivered an allegory, too, about futility, about the necessity and certain betrayal of trust, about human beings who do not for a second have the luxury of doing nothing.\" Bloody Disgusting gave the movie a positive review, writing, \"Shoddy acting and a semi-weak script can't hold this movie back. It's simply too good a premise and too well-directed to let minor hindrances derail its creepy premise.\" Kim Newman from Empire Online gave the film 4/5 stars, writing, \"Too many low-budget sci-fi films try for epic scope and fail; this one concentrates on making the best of what it's got and does it well.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe film won the award for Best Canadian First Feature Film at the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival and the Jury Award at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film.\n\n\n== Sequel and prequel ==\n\nAfter Cube achieved cult status, it was followed by a sequel, Cube 2: Hypercube, released in 2002, and a prequel, Cube Zero, released in 2004.\n\n\n== Remake ==\nIn April 2015, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Lionsgate Films was planning to remake the film, under the title Cubed, with Saman Kesh directing and a screenplay by Jon Spaihts. However, in 2016, the film was stalled, and has remained that way since.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nThe Library of Babel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCube at AllMovie\nCube on IMDb\nCube at Metacritic\nCube at Rotten Tomatoes\nCube at the TCM Movie Database",

Her final film appearance came in the crime drama film The Indian Runner (1991).\nDennis had a successful career on stage, appearing in the original stage production of Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean. For her performance in the play A Thousand Clowns, she received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. For her performance in the play Any Wednesday, she received the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.\nDennis was a well-renowned animal activist. She rescued stray cats from the bowels of Grand Central Terminal. At the time of her death in Westport, CT, she lived with more than 20 cats, who were adopted out by longtime friends to new homes.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDennis was born in Hastings, Nebraska, the daughter of Yvonne (n\u00e9e Hudson), a secretary, and Jack Dennis, a postal clerk. She had a brother, Frank. Dennis grew up in Kenesaw, Nebraska, and Lincoln, Nebraska, graduating from Lincoln High School in 1955. She attended Nebraska Wesleyan University and the University of Nebraska, appearing in the Lincoln Community Theater Group before moving to New York City at the age of 19. She studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nDennis made her television debut in 1956 in the soap opera The Guiding Light.\nShe had an early break when cast as an understudy in the Broadway production of William Inge's The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (1957) directed by Elia Kazan. Kazan cast Dennis in her first feature film, a small part in Splendor in the Grass (1961), which starred Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty.\nDennis was cast in Face of a Hero (1960) on Broadway alongside Jack Lemmon. It had only a short run, but she made a good impression. The Complaisant Lover (1961\u201362) by Graham Greene was more successful, running for 101 performances; Michael Redgrave and Googie Withers were also in the cast.\n\n\n=== Broadway stardom ===\nDennis achieved Broadway fame with her leading role in Herb Gardner's A Thousand Clowns (1962\u201363), for which she won a Tony award for her performance alongside Jason Robards. The show ran for 428 performances. \nAround this time, Dennis guest-starred on episodes of the TV series Naked City (\"Idylls of a Running Back\", 1962, \"Carrier\", 1963), The Fugitive (\"The Other Side of the Mountain\", 1963), Arrest and Trial (\"Somewhat Lower Than the Angels\" 1964), and Mr. Broadway (\"Don't Mention My Name in Sheboygan\", 1964). She was the lead of the Broadway comedy Any Wednesday (1964\u201366), which ran for 983 performances and won her a second Tony.\n\n\n=== Film stardom ===\nDennis's second film role was as Honey, the fragile, neurotic young wife of George Segal's character, in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). Directed by Mike Nichols and starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, the film was a huge critical and commercial success and Dennis won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role.\nDennis returned to the stage in a production of The Three Sisters (1966) with Geraldine Page and Kim Stanley that went to London and was filmed.\nDennis's first lead role in a movie was in Up the Down Staircase (1967), directed by Robert Mulligan, a box-office success, as was The Fox (1967), directed by Mark Rydell, despite its controversial subject matter. In 1967 Dennis was voted the 18th biggest star in the US.Dennis briefly returned to Broadway to star in Daphne in Cottage D (1967), which had a short run.\nShe starred in Sweet November (1968) as a terminally ill woman who takes multiple lovers, and made a TV version of the play A Hatful of Rain (1968).\nDennis went to London to star in A Touch of Love (1969), which flopped at the box office, as did That Cold Day in the Park (1969), despite being directed by Robert Altman. The Out-of-Towners (1970), a Neil Simon comedy with Jack Lemmon, was a hit.\n\n\n=== Television and supporting roles ===\nDennis made a TV movie with Stuart Whitman, Only Way Out Is Dead (1970). She returned to Broadway for How the Other Half Loves (1971) by Alan Ayckbourn, which ran for over 100 performances, then did another TV movie Something Evil (1972), directed by Steven Spielberg, which drew a mixed reception.\nLet Me Hear You Smile (1973) on Broadway only lasted one performance, but Absurd Person Singular (1974\u201376) was a big hit, running 591 performances.\nIn 1974 she played Joan of Arc in the pilot of Witness to Yesterday, Patrick Watson's series of interviews with great figures out of the past.\nDennis was in Mr. Sycamore (1975) with Jason Robards and had a small role in the low-budget horror film God Told Me To (1976) by Larry Cohen. Her performance in the British comedy Nasty Habits (1977) drew harsh criticism from Vincent Canby in the New York Times.Dennis guest starred in Police Story (\"Day of Terror... Night of Fear\", 1978), and starred in the TV movies Perfect Gentlemen (1979) (written by Nora Ephron), and Wilson's Reward (1981). On Broadway she briefly joined the cast of the long-running Same Time, Next Year.\nShe had a well-received part in Alan Alda's The Four Seasons (1981) and was in The Supporting Cast (1981) on Broadway for Gene Saks. She was in the stage production and film version of Robert Altman's Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982).\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nIn the mid- and late 1980s, Dennis acted less due to growing health problems. She appeared on TV in Young People's Specials (\"The Trouble with Mother\", 1985), The Love Boat (\"Roommates/Heartbreaker/Out of the Blue\", 1985), Alfred Hitchcock Presents (\"Arthur, or the Gigolo\", 1985) and The Equalizer (\"Out of the Past\", 1986). In motion pictures, she had supporting roles in a 1986 remake of Laughter in the Dark, which was never completed, Woody Allen's Another Woman (1988), and the horror films 976-EVIL (1989) and Parents (1989).\nHer final role was in the crime drama The Indian Runner, filmed in 1990 and released in 1991. The movie marked Sean Penn's debut as a film director. Actor Viggo Mortensen, who played one of her two sons, wrote of the preparations for the movie and filming in the vicinity of Omaha, Nebraska:\n\n\"When I first met with Sean Penn and his producer, Don Phillips, to discuss the possibility of my playing Frank, one of the first questions I asked them was who, if anyone, they had in mind to play the mother. When Sean answered that he did not want to consider anyone other than Sandy Dennis for the part, I couldn't have been happier, or more in agreement. Aside from my feelings for her as a friend, I believed she would be a great asset to the movie and would inspire us all to do our best. This proved to be true.\nAs it turned out, most of her work was cut from the movie. The bulk of her role was in an eight-page scene in which Frank is taken by [his brother] Joe to visit their parents for the first time since returning from a three-year tour in Vietnam. [The entire long scene was cut so that Frank would seem ungrateful to their parents. Sean Penn felt this improved the movie. In Sandy Dennis\u2019 short scene that remains in the movie, she is seen with her husband, played by Charles Bronson, and only one of their sons, Joe.]\n\n\n== Death ==\nSandy Dennis died from ovarian cancer on March 2, 1992, at her home in Westport, Connecticut, at age 54.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDennis lived with prominent jazz musician Gerry Mulligan from 1965 until they split up in 1974. She lived with actor Eric Roberts from 1980 to 1985. In a 1989 interview with People magazine, Dennis revealed she and Mulligan had suffered a miscarriage in 1965, adding, \"If I'd been a mother, I would have loved the child, but I just didn't have any connection with it when I was pregnant ... I never, ever wanted children. It would have been like having an elephant.\"After Dennis's death, she was identified as bisexual by Hollywood historians. According to her biographer Peter Shelley, Eric Roberts, upon being asked if Dennis was bisexual, said she had told him about her many lesbian relationships and that she \"appreciated the beauty of women. But Sandy also liked and appreciated what a very, very young man could do to a woman, I suppose.\" This was published more than 20 years after her death.\nDuring Dennis's lifetime, in-depth published interviews with her, such as one with The Christian Science Monitor during her stint performing in an ensemble cast at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1981, made no mention of close relationships with women. That interview included the following exchange about her marital status:\n\nAt one point I say, \"When you were married to Gerry Mulligan ...\" but she breaks in, tersely: \"I was never married to anybody.\" I point out that \"Who's Who\" says she was married to Mulligan.\nShe says, \"It's not\u2014I'm not fussy about that\u2014the truth is I was never married. We had a long association but we never married...\"\nBut there it is in Current Biography: \"In June, 1965, after a three-week courtship, Sandy Dennis was married to Gerry Mulligan, the jazz saxophonist and composer.\"\n\nShe sits bolt upright and repeats: \"I've never been married. And I'm not fussy about it. It's just the truth is, that I was never married. It isn't true that I was ever married, which means that I never got a divorce. The newspapers jumped to that conclusion. It's so hard to get to somebody and say ... Oh, they're so funny about it.\"\n\n\n== Acting style ==\nA life member of The Actors Studio and an advocate of method acting, Dennis was often described as neurotic and mannered in her performances; her signature style included running words together and oddly stopping and starting sentences, suddenly going up and down octaves as she spoke, and fluttering her hands. Walter Kerr famously remarked that she treated sentences as \"weak, injured things\" that needed to be slowly helped \"across the street\"; Pauline Kael said that she \"has made an acting style of postnasal drip.\" In his book The Season, William Goldman called her a quintessential \"critics' darling\" who got rave reviews no matter how unusual her acting and questionable her choice of material. During her stint in Any Wednesday, Kerr said, \"Let me tell you about Sandy Dennis. There should be one in every home.\"\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Theater ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternet Broadway Database\nSandy Dennis on IMDb\nSandy Dennis at Find a Grave\nSandy Dennis, Veteran Actress And Prize Winner, Is Dead at 54, New York Times, 5 March 1992",

        "wiki": "The Battle of Kazan (1774) was a major battle during Pugachev's Rebellion. It took place on 12\u201315 July 1774 in Kazan, Russia, and the surrounding area. The first stage began in the morning of 12 July, when rebels under Yemelyan Pugachev defeated government troops and besieged them in the Kazan Kremlin. During the battle some government forces defected to the rebels' side. However, in the evening, tsarist forces under Johann Michelson reached Kazan and defeated the rebels in two battles which took place on 13 and 15 July, forcing Pugachev to retreat to Tsaryovokokshaysk and then to cross the Volga. Out of 25,000 and 15,000 rebels who participated in the first and last stages of the battle respectively, only 500 escaped.\n\n\n== Prelude to the battle ==\nKazan was threatened by Pugachev as early as the autumn of 1773. Many of the town's nobles escaped to Moscow, inspiring fear there. A defensive plan was formulated by the Russian high command and was approved personally by Catherine the Great.\n\n\n=== Kazan's defenders ===\nThere were 3 sectors of defense in Kazan. The first, under general Banner, extended from Kazanka and Arsk Field to Qaban lakes. There, government troops were reinforced by gymnasium pupils under headmaster Kanitsa and armed town militiamen. The second was from the Pleteni to Yamskoy quarter under general-mayor Larionov, and the third was from Yamskoy to Kazanka, under colonel Svechin. The area north from the citadel was defended by Admiralty troops under Shchelin. The citadel itself was reinforced and the garrison under Letskoy was ready to fight. Zilantov Monastery and the Admiralty were turned into strongholds, redoubts were installed at Kazanka's bank and Arsk Field, and a system of knife-rests was installed around the city. Nine cannons were placed behind the knife-rests. The suburban settlements were left to defend themselves without government assistance.\nThere were 1,500 regular troops in Kazan, along with policemen, Admiralty troops and firemen the defenders numbered 2,000. On 2 July the governor von Brandt announced a coming siege.\n\n\n=== Rebels ===\nTen mullahs sent by Catherine's officers to agitate against Pugachev were killed by rebels. The Orthodox bishop Veniamin appealed to Christians to refuse from joining Pugachev army. However, many peasants from the entire region of modern Tatarstan joined the rebellion and marched to Kazan.\nOn 10 and 11 July Pugachev's troops encamped to the north-east of Kazan, between Troitskaya Noksa and Tsaritsyno. The army numbered 25,000, mostly Cossacks supported by Tatar and Udmurt peasants and Bashkir cavalry. Only the Cossacks had firearms; the Bashkirs were armed with bows while the peasants were mostly equipped with clubs and stakes. On 11 July, Pugachev, with an interpreter, approached Kazan borders and demanded that the loyalist forces surrender. The Tatar community was invited to support the rebellion. Von Brandt refused to disarm; however, the Tatars quarters sent seventy emissaries with presents to Pugachev. They also disclosed weaknesses in the Kazan defense.\nOn 12 July, at four o'clock in the morning, Pugachev convened a council of war, dividing his army into 4 groups. The first two under Beloborodov and Mineyev should attack Arsk Field, the main group under Pugachev himself attacked Sukonny (Broadcloth Manufactory) quarter. The group under Ovchinnikov and Bakhmutov should attack Tatar quarters. The storm started at six o'clock after Pugachev's prayer.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\n\n=== Storm of Kazan ===\nBeloborodov took Neyelova grove, the area of modern-day Gorky Park and approached the citadel by the avenue now known as Karl Marx Street. Pugachev's cannons neutralized government artillery and shelled the defenders of the cloth factory under manufacturer Dryablov. Workers joined the rebel army. The fourth group of rebels reached Mokry quarter and Admiralty.\nGovernment troops were forced to retreat and were besieged in the citadel. Nearly half of the defenders, mostly ethnic Tatars, defected to the rebels. The central stone part of Kazan, mostly settled by Russian nobles and merchants, was set on fire. Sukonny and Tatar quarters, however, stayed safe.\nPugachev ordered his troops to safeguard the lives of civilians and captives. They were convoyed to the nearby village of Savinovo, where Pugachev invited them to join his troops. Among others, a captive Lutheran priest was appointed colonel in Pugachev's army, but nobles and resisters were massacred.\n\n\n=== Pugachev's family ===\nPugachev's family, his wife Sofia Dmitrievna, his 11-year-old son Trofim, daughters Khristina and Agrafena and his brother, were imprisoned in Kazan during the rebellion. Sofia Pugacheva should confirm, that Yemelyan isn't  Peter III, but a Cossack. She could visit markets to spread this information. When Pugachev's group marched they occasionally met his family. Trofim called him, but Pugachev said that he is simply a friend of this family. So, he took them to unit transport.\n\n\n=== Michelson's arrival ===\nThe Kremlin surrounded, rebel cannons were installed near Spasskaya Tower and started shelling. After noon, Pugachev stopped the storm and retreated to Arsk Field. There he participated in thanksgiving service. Then he had a dinner at Tatar merchant Musa Apanayev's house.\nIn the evening governmental troops from Ufa under Johann Michelson reached Kazan. A harsh battle took place at the modern Gogol street, but neither side won. Pugachev retreated to Savinovo and Sukhaya Reka villages. On 13 July he tried to prevent the end of the siege  of the citadel, but under the pressure of Michelson and Potyomkin the rebels were defeated and were forced to retreat. On 15 July Pugachyov's army of 15,000 was defeated in the battle of Arsk Field. Pugachev with 500 men escaped to Tsaryovokokshaysk, to cross the Volga on 18 July and to continue his struggle then. Michelson didn't follow him, as government forces had no horses.\nBefore the trial captives were imprisoned in a camp near the suburb of Bishbalta. In autumn two gallows were placed in Kazan, one in Sukonny, another in Tatar quarter. Many captive rebels were executed, including Beloborodov and Mineyev.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter Pugachev's escape some rebel groups under B\u00e4xti\u00e4r Qanqay\u0131v and Usman Timerev continued the resistance, but they were shortly neutralized by governmental troops.\nThe battle of Kazan had a significant role in Tatarstan's history. The Tatar participation in the rebellion numbered up to 85,000. Nevertheless, the participants of the rebellion were harshly punished. The Tsar's government continued its policy of the support of Muslim nobility and clergy, to prevent similar uprisings as a result of religious oppression in the future. Feudal oppression, however, stayed for a long time.This battle took a major place in the Soviet culture. The first Tatar movie Bulat-Bat\u0131r was devoted to Pugachev rebellion in Tatarstan and the siege of Kazan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPugachov's oak\n\n\n== References and footnotes ==",

        "wiki": "Elia Kazan (; born Elias Kazantzoglou (Greek: \u0397\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03cc\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5); September 7, 1909 \u2013 September 28, 2003) was a Greek-American director, producer, writer and actor, described by The New York Times as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history\".He was born in Istanbul, to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including City for Conquest (1940).His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was Gentleman's Agreement (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by Pinky, one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received twelve Oscar nominations, winning four, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's East of Eden, which introduced James Dean to movie audiences.\nA turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong.\" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses.\" Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous.\" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film A Letter to Elia as a personal tribute to Kazan.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nElia Kazan was born in the Fener district of Istanbul, to Cappadocian Greek parents originally from Kayseri in Anatolia. He arrived with his parents, George and Athena Kazantzoglou (n\u00e9e Shishmanoglou), to the United States on 8 July 1913. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Elia Kazantzoglou. His maternal grandfather was Isaak Shishmanoglou. Elia's brother, Avraam, was born in Berlin and later became a psychiatrist.Kazan was raised in the Greek Orthodox religion and attended Greek Orthodox services every Sunday, where he had to stand for several hours with his father. His mother read the Bible but did not go to church. When Kazan was about eight years old, the family moved to New Rochelle, New York, and his father sent him to a Roman Catholic catechism school because there was no Orthodox church nearby.\n\nAs a young boy, he was remembered as being shy, and his college classmates described him as more of a loner. Much of his early life was portrayed in his autobiographical book, America America, which he made into a film in 1963. In it, he describes his family as \"alienated\" from both their parents' Greek Orthodox values and from those of mainstream America. His mother's family were cotton merchants who imported cotton from England and sold it wholesale.  His father had become a rug merchant after emigrating to the United States and expected that his son would go into the same business.After attending public schools through high school, Kazan enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he helped pay his way by waiting tables and washing dishes; he still graduated cum laude. He also worked as a bartender at various fraternities, but never joined one. While a student at Williams, he earned the nickname \"Gadg,\" for Gadget, because, he said, \"I was small, compact, and handy to have around.\" The nickname was eventually taken up by his stage and film stars.\nIn America America he tells how, and why, his family left Turkey and moved to America. Kazan notes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that \"it's all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to Istanbul ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances ... It's also true that he lost the money on the way, and when he got there he swept rugs in a little store.\"Kazan notes some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film. He writes \"I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas.\" To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan's uncle Avraam kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:\n\nI hesitated about that for a long time. A lot of people, who don't understand how desperate people can get, advised me to cut it. When I am accused of being excessive by the critics, they're talking about moments like that. But I wouldn't take it out for the world. It actually happened. Believe me, if a Turk could get out of Turkey and come here, even now, he would kiss the ground. To oppressed people, America is still a dream.\nBefore undertaking the film, Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family's background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a \"deeper question: 'Why America? What were you hoping for?'\" His mother gave him the answer, however: \"A.E. brought us here.\" Kazan states that \"A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey. At twenty-eight, somehow\u2014this was the wonder\u2014he made his way to New York. He sent home money and in time brought my father over. Father sent for my mother and my baby brother and me when I was four.\nKazan writes of the movie, \"It's my favorite of all the films I've made; the first film that was entirely mine.\"\n\n\n== Stage career ==\n\n\n=== Group Theatre ===\n\nIn 1932, after spending two years at the Yale University School of Drama, he moved to New York City to become a professional stage actor. He continued his professional studies at the Juilliard School where he studied singing with Lucia Dunham. His first opportunity came with a small group of actors engaged in presenting plays containing \"social commentary\". They were called the Group Theatre, which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages. After struggling to be accepted by them, he discovered his first strong sense of self in America within the \"family of the Group Theatre, and more loosely in the radical social and cultural movements of the time,\" writes film author Joanna E. Rapf.In Kazan's autobiography, he writes of the \"lasting impact on him of the Group,\" noting in particular, Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman as \"father figures\", along with his close friendship with playwright Clifford Odets. Kazan, during an interview with Michel Ciment, describes the Group:\n\nThe Group was the best thing professionally that ever happened to me. I met two wonderful men. Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman, both of whom were around thirty years old. They were magnetic, fearless leaders. During the summer I was an apprentice, they were entertaining in a Jewish summer camp ... At the end of the summer they said to me: \"You may have talent for something, but it's certainly not acting.\"Kazan, in his autobiography, also describes Strasberg as a vital leader of the group:\n\nHe carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home ... [H]e was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them permanent.Kazan's first national success came as a New York theatrical director. Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Group's most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by Clifford Odets, Waiting for Lefty, and his performance was called \"dynamic,\" leading some to describe him as the \"proletarian thunderbolt.\"Among the themes that would run through all of his work were \"personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice\", writes film critic William Baer. Other critics have likewise noted his \"strong commitment to the social and social psychological\u2014rather than the purely political\u2014implications of drama\".By the mid-1930s, when he was 26, he began directing a number of the Group Theatre's plays, including Robert Ardrey's well-known play Thunder Rock. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by Thornton Wilder, The Skin of Our Teeth, starring Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a Pulitzer Prize. Kazan won the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller, and then directed A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams, both of which were also successful. Kazan's wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a \"prize that launched his career.\"The Group Theatre's summer rehearsal headquarters was at Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, during the 1930s and early 1940s. Along with Kazan were numerous other artists: Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Luise Rainer, Frances Farmer, Will Geer, Howard Da Silva, Clifford Odets, Lee J. Cobb and Irwin Shaw.\n\n\n=== Actors Studio ===\nIn 1947, he founded the Actors Studio, a non-profit workshop, with actors Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford. In 1951, Lee Strasberg became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the \"Method\" to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of Konstantin Stanislavski's teachings. The \"Method\" school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.\nAmong Strasberg's students were Montgomery Clift, Mildred Dunnock, Julie Harris, Karl Malden, Patricia Neal, Maureen Stapleton, Eli Wallach, and James Whitmore. \nKazan directed two of the Studio's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Karl Malden and Marlon Brando, in the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nThough at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films, but his first feature film was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed Gentleman's Agreement, where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in America, antisemitism, for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1949 he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed Pinky, which dealt with issues of racism in America, and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.\nIn 1947, he directed the courtroom drama Boomerang!, and in 1950 he directed Panic in the Streets, starring Richard Widmark, in a thriller shot on the streets of New Orleans. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in \"energizing\" the action scenes. He won the Venice Film Festival International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that Zero Mostel also act in the film, despite Mostel being \"blacklisted\" as a result of HUAC testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:\n\nEach director has a favorite in his cast, ... my favorite this time was Zero Mostel ... I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I'd ever met ... I constantly sought his company ... He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the \"industry's\" blacklist ... For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.\nIn 1951, after introducing and directing Marlon Brando and Karl Malden in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, A Streetcar Named Desire, which won 4 Oscars, being nominated for 12.\nDespite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater, though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, but he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:\n\nOn \"Streetcar\" we worked very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I actually did was to make the set smaller. As the story progressed ... the set got smaller and smaller.Kazan's next film was Viva Zapata! (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his \"first real film\" because of those factors.In 1954 he again used Brando as a star in On the Waterfront.  As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York's longshoremen's union. It too was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, and won 8, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, for Marlon Brando.\nOn the Waterfront was also the screen debut for Eva Marie Saint, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:\n\nI ended up crying. Crying and laughing ... I mean there was such an attraction there ... That smile of his ... He was very tender and funny ... And Kazan, in his genius, saw the chemistry there.\nLife magazine described On the Waterfront as the \"most brutal movie of the year\" but with \"the year's tenderest love scenes,\" and stating that Saint was a \"new discovery\" in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in On the Waterfront that she \"starts her real trip to fame.\"The film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer Leonard Bernstein.\n\nAfter the success of On the Waterfront, he went on to direct another screen adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel, East of Eden (1955). As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, James Dean. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag. The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), directed by Kazan's friend Nicholas Ray, and then Giant (1956), directed by George Stevens.\nAuthor Douglas Rathgeb describes the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he \"kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.\" As a result, Kazan was forced to \"baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers,\" so he wouldn't run away during production. Co-star Julie Harris worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that \"his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears.\"\nDean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director Nicholas Ray to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in Rebel Without a Cause. Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen; but it didn't seem possible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. \"Dean himself did not seem to believe it,\" notes Rathgeb. \"He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.\"The film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car outside of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was East of Eden.\nIn 1961, he introduced Warren Beatty in his first screen appearance with a starring role in Splendor in the Grass (1961), with Natalie Wood; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author Peter Biskind points out that Kazan \"was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.\" Biskind notes also that they \"were wildly dissimilar\u2014mentor vs. prot\u00e9g\u00e9, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.\"  Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:\n\nWarren\u2014it was obvious the first time I saw him\u2014wanted it all and wanted it his way. Why not? He had the energy, a very keen intelligence, and more chutzpah than any Jew I've ever known. Even more than me. Bright as they come, intrepid, and with that thing all women secretly respect: complete confidence in his sexual powers, confidence so great that he never had to advertise himself, even by hints.Biskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: \"The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HUAC. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something\u2014why did you name all those names?'\"Beatty recalled the episode: \"In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.\" Biskind describes how \"Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.\" Beatty, years later, during a Kennedy Center tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan \"had given him the most important break in his career.\"Beatty's costar, Natalie Wood, was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer Suzanne Finstad notes that a \"turning point\" in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film A Streetcar Named Desire: \"She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie.\" In 1961, after a \"series of bad films, her career was already in decline,\" notes Rathgeb. Kazan writes that the \"sages\" of the film community declared her as \"washed up\" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:\n\nWhen I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J., I said to myself. I liked Bob Wagner, I still do.Kazan cast her as the female lead in Splendor in the Grass, and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, \"working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on Splendor.\" She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of \"Kazan's wizardry ...  produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.\"Actor Gary Lockwood, who also acted in the film, felt that \"Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.\" Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). \"It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,\" writes Kazan. \"And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.\"\n\n\n=== Screenwriters ===\nKazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Inge; in film, he worked again with Willams (A Streetcar Named Desire and Baby Doll), Inge (Splendor in the Grass), Budd Schulberg (On the Waterfront and A Face in the Crowd), John Steinbeck (Viva Zapata!), and Harold Pinter (The Last Tycoon). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, \"he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.\" In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond, was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.Williams became one of Kazan's closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of \"creative slumps\" by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, \"Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.\"Among Kazan's other films were Panic in the Streets (1950), East of Eden (1955), Baby Doll (1956), Wild River (1960), and The Last Tycoon (1976).\n\n\n== Literary career ==\nIn between his directing work he wrote four best-selling novels, including America America and The Arrangement, both of which tell the story of Kazan's Greek immigrant ancestors. Both novels were later made into films.\n\n\n== Directing style ==\n\n\n=== Preference for unknown actors ===\nKazan strove for \"cinematic realism,\" a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict \"social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity.\" He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie's ultimate success or failure. As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as Lee Remick, Jo Van Fleet, Warren Beatty, Andy Griffith, James Dean, and Jack Palance, their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer George Stevens, Jr. that he felt that \"big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits ... they're not pliable anymore.\" Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:\nNow what I try to do is get to know them very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human material is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.Kazan goes on to describe how he got to understand James Dean, as an example:\n\nWhen I met him he said, \"I'll take you for a ride on my motorbike ...\" It was his way of communicating with me, saying \"I hope you like me, ...\" I thought he was an extreme grotesque of a boy, a twisted boy. As I got to know his father, as I got to know about his family, I learned that he had been, in fact, twisted by the denial of love ... I went to Jack Warner and told him I wanted to use an absolutely unknown boy. Jack was a crapshooter of the first order, and said, \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\n=== Topics of personal and social realism ===\nKazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:\n\nI don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life. I start with an instinct. With East of Eden ... it's really the story of my father and me, and I didn't realize it for a long time ... In some subtle or not-so-subtle way, every film is autobiographical. A thing in my life is expressed by the essence of the film. Then I know it experientially, not just mentally. I've got to feel that it's in some way about me, some way about my struggles, some way about my pain, my hopes.Film historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on \"reality\", although his style was not defined as \"naturalistic.\" She adds: \"He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.\" Kazan states that \"unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him.\"In his later years he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a\n\"collective art,\" as he once believed:\n\nTo be successful it should express the vision, the conviction, and the insistent presence of one person.Film author Peter Biskind described Kazan's career as \"fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work.\" Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:\n\nI don't think basically I'm a political animal. I think I'm a self-centered animal ... I think what I was concerned about all my life was to say something artistically that was uniquely my own.Nonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed On the Waterfront, written by screenwriter Budd Schulberg, which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.\" Another political film was A Face in the Crowd (1957). His protagonist, played by Andy Griffith (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn \"of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation.\" Kazan states, \"Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package.\"\n\n\n=== Use of \"Method\" acting ===\nAs a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of \"Method\" actors, especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, \"I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance including so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends ... The director is a desperate beast! ... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.\" Actor Robert De Niro called him a \"master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting.\"Kazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:\n\nI don't have great range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The classics are beyond me ... I am a mediocre director except when a play or film touches a part of my life's experience ... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors ... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.He explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:\n\nWhen I talk to the actors they begin to give me ideas, and I grab them because the ideas they give me turn them on. I want the breath of life from them rather than the mechanical fulfillment of the movement which I asked for ... I love actors. I used to be an actor for eight years, so I do appreciate their job.Kazan, however, held strong ideas about the scenes and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in Baby Doll, for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker, he privately asked Wallach, \"Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?\" Wallach writes, \"I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered ... 'No.'\" Kazan replies, \"Good idea, play it that way.\" Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:\n\nWhat is erotic about sex to me is the seduction, not the act ... The scene on the swings (Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker) in Baby Doll is my exact idea of what eroticism in films should be.\n\n\n=== Being an \"actor's director\" ===\nJoanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director Nicholas Ray considered him \"the best actor's director the United States has ever produced.\" Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that \"he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method ... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism.\"Among the actors who describe Kazan as an important influence in their career were Patricia Neal, who co-starred with Andy Griffith in A Face in the Crowd (1957): \"He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.\" Anthony Franciosa, a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:\n\nHe would always say, 'Let me see what you can do. Let me see it. Don't talk to me about it.' You felt that you had a man who was completely on your side\u2014no qualms about anything you did. He gave you a tremendous sense of confidence ... He never made me feel as though I was acting for the camera. Many times, I never even knew where the camera was.However, in order to get quality acting from Andy Griffith, in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls \"an astonishing movie debut,\" Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: \"I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.\"Actress Terry Moore calls Kazan her \"best friend,\" and notes that \"he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life.\" \"He would find out if your life was like the character,\" says Carroll Baker, star of Baby Doll, \"he was the best director with actors.\"Kazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, The Last Tycoon (1976). He remembers that Robert De Niro, the star of the film, \"would do almost anything to succeed,\" and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro \"is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.\"The powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal character traits.  Although he didn't know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, \"Bobby is more meticulous ... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.\" Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film. Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that \"for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather, part II, ... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest.\"Marlon Brando, in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:\n\nI have worked with many movie directors\u2014some good, some fair, some terrible. Kazan was the best actors' director by far of any I've worked for ... the only one who ever really stimulated me, got into a part with me and virtually acted it with me ... he chose good actors, encouraged them to improvise, and then improvised on the improvisation ... He gave his cast freedom and ... was always emotionally involved in the process and his instincts were perfect ... I've never seen a director who became as deeply and emotionally involved in a scene as Gadg ... he got so wrought up that he started chewing on his hat.He was an arch-manipulator of actors' feelings, and he was extraordinarily talented; perhaps we will never see his like again.\n\n\n== HUAC testimony ==\n\nKazan testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) in 1952, during the postwar era that journalist Michael Mills, calls \"arguably the most controversial period in Hollywood history.\" When Kazan was in his mid-20s, during the Depression years 1934 to 1936, he had been a member of the American Communist Party in New York, for a year and a half.\nIn April 1952, the Committee called on Kazan, under oath, to identify Communists from that period 16 years earlier. Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former Group Theatre members who he said had been Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller, who later married Lee Strasberg. He testified that Odets quit the party at the same time that he did. All the persons named were already known to HUAC, however. The move cost Kazan many friends within the film industry, including playwright Arthur Miller.Kazan would later write in his autobiography of the \"warrior pleasure at withstanding his 'enemies.\"\nWhen Kazan received an Honorary Academy Award in 1999, the audience was noticeably divided in their reaction, with some including Nick Nolte, Ed Harris, Ian McKellen, and Amy Madigan refusing to applaud, and many others, such as actors Kathy Bates, Meryl Streep, Karl Malden, and Warren Beatty, and producer George Stevens, Jr. standing and applauding. Stevens speculates on why he, Beatty, and many others in the audience chose to stand and applaud:\n\nI never discussed it with Warren, but I believe we were both standing for the same reason\u2014out of regard for the creativity, the stamina and the many fierce battles and lonely nights that had gone into the man's twenty motion pictures.Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan agreed, writing \"The only criterion for an award like this is the work\". Kazan was already \"denied accolades\" from the American Film Institute, and other film critics' associations. According to Mills, \"It's time for the Academy to recognize this genius,\" adding that \"We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour.\" In response, former vice president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Joseph McBride, claimed that an honorary award recognizes \"the totality of what he represents, and Kazan's career, post 1952, was built on the ruin of other people's careers.\"In later interviews, Kazan explained some of the early events that made him decide to become a friendly witness, most notably in relation to the Group Theatre, which he called his first \"family,\" and the \"best thing professionally\" that ever happened to him:\n\nThe Group Theatre said that we shouldn't be committed to any fixed political program set by other people outside the organization. I was behaving treacherously to the Group when I met downtown at CP [Communist Party] headquarters, to decide among the Communists what we should do in the Group, and then come back and present a united front, pretending we had not been in caucus ...\nI was tried by the Party and that was one of the reasons I became so embittered later. The trial was on the issue of my refusal to follow instructions, that we should strike in the Group Theatre, and insist that the membership have control of its organization. I said it was an artistic organization, and I backed up Clurman and Strasberg who were not Communists ... The trial left an indelible impression on me ... Everybody else voted against me and they stigmatized me and condemned my acts and attitude. They were asking for confession and self-humbling. I went home that night and told my wife \"I am resigning.\" But for years after I resigned, I was still faithful to their way of thinking. I still believed in it. But not in the American Communists. I used to make a difference and think: \"These people here are damned fools but in Russia they have got the real thing,\" until I learned about the Hitler-Stalin pact, and gave up on the USSR.Mills notes that prior to becoming a \"friendly witness,\" Kazan discussed the issues with Miller:\n\nTo defend a secrecy I don't think right and to defend people who have already been named or soon would be by someone else ... I hate the Communists and have for many years, and don't feel right about giving up my career to defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I believe in, but not this.Miller put his arm around Kazan and retorted, \"Don't worry about what I'll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place.\"In his memoirs, Kazan writes that his testimony meant that \"the big shot had become the outsider.\" He also notes that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, Tennessee Williams, with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams \"the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nElia Kazan was married three times. His first wife was playwright Molly Day Thacher. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons, including screenwriter Nicholas Kazan. His second marriage, to the actress Barbara Loden, lasted from 1967 until her death in 1980, and produced one son. His marriage, in 1982, to Frances Rudge continued until his death, in 2003, aged 94.\nIn 1978, the U.S. government paid for Kazan and his family to travel to Kazan's birthplace where many of his films were to be shown. During a speech in Athens, he discussed his films and his personal and business life in the U.S., along with the messages he tried to convey:\n\nIn my own view, the solution is to talk about human beings and not about abstracts, to reveal the culture and the social moment as it is reflected in the behavior and the lives of individual people. Not to be \"correct.\" To be total. So I do not believe in any ideology that does not permit\u2014no encourage\u2014the freedom of the individual.\nHe also offered his opinions about the role of the U.S. as a world model for democracy:\n\nI think you and I, all of us, have some sort of stake in the United States. If it fails, the failure will be that of us all. Of mankind itself. It will cost us all.  ... I think of the United States as a country which is an arena and in that arena there is a drama being played out.  ... I have seen that the struggle is the struggle of free men.\nElia Kazan died from natural causes in his Manhattan apartment, September 28, 2003, aged 94.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nIn addition to these awards, Kazan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located on 6800 Hollywood Boulevard. He is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.Directed Academy Award Performances\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nKazan became known as an \"actor's director\" because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars. Under his direction, his actors received 24 Academy Award nominations and won nine Oscars.\nHe won as Best Director for Gentleman's Agreement (1947) and for On the Waterfront (1954). Both A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront were nominated for twelve Academy Awards, respectively winning four and eight.\n\nWith his many years with the Group Theatre and Actors Studio in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous \"for the power and intensity of his actors' performances.\" He was the pivotal figure in launching the film careers of Marlon Brando, James Dean, Julie Harris, Eli Wallach, Eva Marie Saint, Warren Beatty, Lee Remick, Karl Malden, and many others. Seven of Kazan's films won a total of 20 Academy Awards. Dustin Hoffman commented that he \"doubted whether he, Robert De Niro, or Al Pacino, would have become actors without Mr. Kazan's influence.\"Upon his death, at the age of 94, the New York Times described him as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history.\" The Death of a Salesman and A Streetcar Named Desire, two plays he directed, are considered to be some of the greatest of the 20th century. Although he became a respected director on Broadway, he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major film directors of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career \"he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations\", adding that \"he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema\". Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.His controversial stand during his testimony in front of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, became the low point in his career, although he remained convinced that he made the right decision to give the names of Communist Party members. He stated in an interview in 1976 that \"I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did, and betray my own soul. I didn't betray it. I made a difficult decision.\"During his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for directing on stage and screen. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for lifetime achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who wrote On the Waterfront, thanked his lifelong friend saying, \"Elia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.\"In 1999, at the 71st Academy Awards, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro presented the Honorary Oscar to Kazan. This would be a controversial pick for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences due to Kazan's past history regarding his involvement with the Hollywood Blacklist in the 1950s. Several members of the audience including Nick Nolte and Ed Harris refused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such as Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, and Kurt Russell gave him a standing ovation.Martin Scorsese has directed a film documentary, A Letter to Elia  (2010), considered to be an \"intensely personal and deeply moving tribute\" to Kazan. Scorsese was \"captivated\" by Kazan's films as a young man, and the documentary mirrors his own life story while he also credits Kazan as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker. It won a Peabody Award in 2010.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKazan, Elia (1962). America America. New York: Popular Library. OCLC 21378773.\nKazan, Elia (1967). The Arrangement: A Novel.

        "wiki": "Mary is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), epithets (Star of the Sea, Queen of Heaven, Cause of Our Joy), invocations (Panagia, Mother of Mercy) and names associated with places, (Our Lady of Loreto, Our Lady of Guadalupe).\n\nAll of these descriptives refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ (in the New Testament) and are used differently by Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and some Anglicans. (Note: Mary Magdalene, Mary of Clopas, and Mary Salome are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\nSome descriptives of Mary are properly titles, dogmatic in nature, some of them are invocations. Other descriptives are poetic or allegorical or have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of popular piety, with varying degrees of acceptance by Church authorities. There is another class of titles which refer to depictions of Mary in Catholic Marian art and in art generally. A rich range of Marian titles also belong to musical settings.\n\n\n== Historical and cultural context ==\n\nThe relatively large number of titles given to Mary may be explained in several ways. Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to Marian apparitions.\nMary's intercession is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This has led to the formulation of many of her titles (good counsel, Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of Mary's role in the life of Jesus have led to additional titles, such as Our Lady of Sorrows. Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the Assumption of Mary, Dormition of the Mother of God and Immaculate Conception.\nThe veneration of Mary or \"devotional cult\" was consolidated in the year 431 when, at the Council of Ephesus, the descriptive, Theotokos, or Mary the bearer (or mother) of God, was declared a dogma. Thereafter Marian devotion, centred on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church, began to flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\nThe Reformation diminished Mary's role in many parts of Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Council of Trent and Counter Reformation intensified Marian devotion in the Western Europe. Around the same period, Mary became an instrument of evangelisation in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g. gaining impetus from reported apparitions at Our Lady of Guadalupe, which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in Mexico.\nFollowing the Reformation, baroque literature on Mary experienced unprecedented growth, with over 500 instances of Mariological writings during the 17th century alone. During the Age of Enlightenment, the emphasis on scientific progress and rationalism put Catholic theology and Mariology often on the defensive later in the 18th century. Books, such as The Glories of Mary by Alphonsus Liguori, were written in defence of the cult of Mary.\n\n\n== Dogmatic titles ==\n\nMother of God: The Council of Ephesus decreed in 431 that Mary is Theotokos because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human). This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\nVirgin Mary: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria (and others). In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary. Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\nImmaculate Conception: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by Pope Pius IX's apostolic constitution Ineffabilis Deus. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of Our Lady of Caysasay (Philippines), Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius, Our Lady of Guidance, and Our Lady of Salambao, also in the Philippines.\nAssumption: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by Pope Pius XII in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to Our Lady of Ta' Pinu on Malta.In the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches the Assumption of Mary may be translated as the Dormition of the Mother of God, it is an important feast day, not based on a scriptural canon but, affirmed by tradition.\n\n\n== Early titles of Mary ==\n\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".\nMary was identified as the \"New Eve\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. Justin Martyr (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his Dialogue with Trypho. This idea is later expanded by Irenaeus.\nJohn Chrysostom, in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title Mary Help of Christians as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. Don Bosco promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\nStella Maris or Our Lady, Star of the Sea is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to Jerome and cited by Paschasius Radbertus.\n\n\n== Papal actions ==\n\nAfter the Battle of Lepanto in 1521, Pope Pius V instituted the feast of the Blessed Virgin Mother of Victory.\nThe first Marian image pontifically crowned was Lippo Memmi\u2019s  painting of La Madonna della Febbre (Madonna of Fever) in the sacristy of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome on 27 May 1631, by Pope Urban VIII by the Vatican Chapter.\nThe doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary was adopted as church dogma when Pope Pius IX promulgated Ineffabilis Deus in 1854.\nThe encyclical Ad diem illum of Pope Pius X commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the dogma of Immaculate Conception\nDuring World War I, Pope Benedict XV added the invocation Mary Queen of Peace to the Litany of Loreto.\nPope Pius XII issued the Apostolic constitution  Munificentissimus Deus to define ex cathedra the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\nIn 1954 the papal encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam, issued by Pope Pius XII, explained how Mary is Queen of Heaven\nIn 1960 Pope John XXIII changed the title of the \"Feast of the Holy Rosary\" (formerly the \"Feast of Our Lady of Victory\") to the \"Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.\"\nPope John Paul II's 1987 encyclical Redemptoris Mater took the step of addressing the role of the Virgin Mary as Mediatrix.\nSeveral Papal actions over the centuries decreed the appellation \"Queen of Poland\" for Mary, following the solemn vows of King John Casimir Vasa before the papal legate and assembled episcopate, proclaiming Mary \"Queen\" of all his lands, at Lw\u00f3w Cathedral on 1st April 1656. The last act was of John Paul II on 1st April 2005, on the eve of his death. The feast of The Most Holy Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland is on 3 May.\n\n\n== Descriptive titles of Mary related to visual arts ==\n\n\n== Devotional titles ==\nIn the Loreto Litanies Mary's prayers are invoked under more than fifty separate titles, such as \"Mother Most Pure\", \"Virgin Most Prudent\", and \"Cause of Our Joy\".Other devotional titles include:\n\n\n=== Theological Mariology ===\n\nWith the exception of the Jesus Christ, who is believed to have a twofold nature, both human and divine, (dyophysitism), the Blessed Virgin Mary is considered among many Christians to be the unique human being about whom there is a dogma. She is connected to four different dogmas and numerous Marian titles. Christian invocations, titles, and art bear witness to the prominent role she has been accorded in the history and programme of salvation in parts of Christendom, although this is not shared by some (mainly reformed) Christian churches.  \nIn the Hail Mary prayer, she is addressed as \"full of grace\" by Archangel Gabriel of the Annunciation speaking in the Name of God. The Nicene Creed, declares that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man,\". This has given rise to the descriptive, \"spouse of the Holy Spirit\".\nTradition has it that the Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit, hence putting her on a par with the anointing of the Kings, Prophets, Judges, and High Priests of Israel, as Jesus Christ is said to have been. \nThis in turn opens the way to titles such as: \n\nAdvocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel)\nMediatrix of all graces (like a High Priest of Israel),\nQueen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the Coronation of the Virgin paintings represent the hierarchy of angels of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\nMarian apparitions are said to testify to Mary's gift of prophecy.In the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Churches, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special form expressed in Greek as hyperdulia, that is, secondary only to the adoration reserved for the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in this way since no other being--whether angelic or human--has greater power than Mary to intercede with God in the distribution of Grace to His children.\n\n\n== Titles associated with devotional images ==\n\nThe \"Black Madonna\" (Fr: Vierges Noires) is a statue or painting of Mary, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, where she often with the infant Jesus, are depicted as having swarthy or black skin.  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe alone. The title given to Mary, usually reflects the location of the image. The Black Madonna of Cz\u0119stochowa, the Virgin of Candelaria, Our Lady of Ferguson, and Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage are noted examples.\nMother of Good Counsel (Latin: Mater boni consilii) is a title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary, after a painting said to be miraculous, now found in the thirteenth century Augustinian church at Genazzano, near Rome, Italy.\nMother Thrice Admirable refers to Mary depicted in a painting as Our Lady Refuge of Sinners. Devotion to this invocation of Mary is significant to the Schoenstatt Movement.Titles of images related to epithets include: \n\nTitles of images related to places of worship include:\n\n\n== Titles associated with apparitions ==\n\n\n== Latin America ==\nA number of titles of Mary found in Latin America pertain to cultic images of her represented in iconography identified with a particular already existent title adapted to a particular place. Our Lady of Luj\u00e1n in Argentina refers to a small terracotta image made in Brazil and sent to Argentina in May, 1630. Its appearance seems to have been inspired by Murillo's Immaculates. Our Lady of Copacabana (Bolivia): is a figure related to devotion to Mary under the title \"Most Blessed Virgin de la Candelaria, Our Lady of Copacabana\". About four feet in height, the statue was made by Francisco Tito Yupanqui around 1583 and is garbed in the colors and dress of an Inca princess.\n\n\n== Titles in the Orthodox Church ==\n\nTheotokos means \"God-bearer\" and is translated as \"Mother of God\". This title was given to Mary at the Third Ecumenical Council in Ephesus in 431 AD.(cf. Luke 1:43).\n\n\n== Titles of Mary in Islam ==\n\nThe Qur'an refers to Mary (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u064a\u0645\u200e, romanized: Maryam) by the following titles:\n\nMa'suma - \"She who never sinned\"\nMustafia - \"She who is chosen\"\nNur - \"Light\". She has also been called Umm Nur (\"Mother of one who was Light\"), in reference to 'Isa\nQ\u0101nitah - the term implies constant submission to Allah, as well as absorption in prayer and invocation.\nR\u0101ki\u2019ah - \"She who bows down to Allah in worship\"\nSa\u2019imah - \"She who fasts\"\nS\u0101jidah - \"She who prostrates to Allah in worship\"\nSiddiqah - \"She who accepts as true\", \"She who has faith\", or \"She who believes sincerely totally\"\nT\u0101hirah - \"She who was purified\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAgni Parthene\nAve Maria ...

Its capital is the city of Kazan.\nThe republic borders Kirov, Ulyanovsk, Samara, and Orenburg Oblasts, the Mari El, Udmurt, and Chuvash Republics, and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The area of the republic is 68,000 square kilometres (26,000 sq mi). The unofficial Tatarstan motto is Bez Buld\u0131rab\u0131z! (We can!). As of the 2010 Census, the population of Tatarstan was 3,786,488.The state has strong cultural ties with its eastern neighbor, the Republic of Bashkortostan.The state languages of the Republic of Tatarstan are Tatar and Russian.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\"Tatarstan\" derives from the name of the ethnic group\u2014the Tatars\u2014and the Persian suffix -stan (meaning \"state\" or \"country\" of, an ending common to many Eurasian countries). Another version of the Russian name is \"\u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0438\u044f\" (Tatariya), which was official along with \"Tatar ASSR\" during Soviet rule.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe republic is located in the center of the East European Plain, approximately 800 kilometers (500 mi) east of Moscow.  It lies between the Volga River and the Kama River (a tributary of the Volga), and extends east to the Ural mountains.\n\nBorders:\ninternal: Kirov Oblast (N), Udmurt Republic (N/NE), Republic of Bashkortostan (E/SE), Orenburg Oblast (SE), Samara Oblast (S), Ulyanovsk Oblast (S/SW), Chuvash Republic (W), Mari El Republic (W/NW).\nHighest point: 381 m (1,250 ft)\nMaximum N\u2013S distance: 290 km (180 mi)\nMaximum E\u2013W distance: 460 km (290 mi)\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\n\nMajor rivers include (Tatar names are given in parentheses):\n\nAzevka River (\u00c4zi)\nBelaya River (A\u011fidel)\nIk River (Iq)\nKama River (\u00c7ulman)\nVolga River (\u0130del)\nVyatka River (Noqrat)\nKazanka River (Qazansu)\nZay River (Z\u00e4y)\n\n\n=== Lakes ===\nMajor reservoirs of the republic include (Tatar names are given in parentheses):\n\nKuybyshev Reservoir (Kuyb\u0131\u015fev)\nLower Kama Reservoir (T\u00fcb\u00e4n Kama)\nZainsk Reservoir (Z\u00e4y susaqla\u011f\u0131\u00e7\u0131)The biggest lake is Qaban. The biggest swamp is Kulyagash.\n\n\n=== Hills ===\nBugulma-Belebey Upland\nVolga Upland\nVyatskie Uvaly\n\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nMajor natural resources of Tatarstan include oil, natural gas, gypsum, and more.  It is estimated that the Republic has over one billion tons of oil deposits.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAverage January temperature: \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F)\nAverage July temperature: +18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F)\nAverage annual temperature: +4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F)\nAverage annual precipitation: up to 500 to 550 mm (20 to 22 in)\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nAdministrative and territorial division: 43 municipal districts and 2 urban districts (Kazan and Naberezhnye Chelny), as well as 39 urban settlements and 872 rural settlements.\nThe Republic of Tatarstan consists of districts and cities of republican significance, the list of which is established by the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan. The districts consist of cities of district significance, urban-type settlements and rural settlements with subordinate territories that make up the primary level in the system of administrative-territorial structure of the Republic. Cities of national significance can be geographically divided into districts in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe earliest known organized state within the boundaries of Tatarstan was Volga Bulgaria (c. 700\u20131238). The Volga Bulgars had an advanced mercantile state with trade contacts throughout Inner Eurasia, the Middle East, and the Baltic, which maintained its independence despite pressure by such nations as the Khazars, the Kievan Rus, and the Cuman-Kipchaks. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922.\n\nVolga Bulgaria finally fell to the armies of the Mongol prince Batu Khan in the late 1230s (see Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria). The inhabitants, mixing with the Golden Horde's Kipchak-speaking people, became known as the \"Volga Tatars\". Another theory postulates that there were no ethnic changes in that period, and Bulgars simply switched to the Kipchak-based Tatar language. In the 1430s, the region again became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km (110 mi) up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars.\nThe Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. A large number of Bulgars were killed and forcibly converted to Christianity and were culturally Russified. Cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593 all mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine the Great. The first mosque to be rebuilt under Catherine's auspices was constructed in 1766\u20131770.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Tatarstan became a center of Jadidism, an Islamic movement that preached tolerance of other religions. Under the influence of local Jadidist theologians, the Bulgars were renowned for their friendly relations with other peoples of the Russian Empire. However, after the October Revolution religion was largely outlawed and all theologians were repressed.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nDuring the Civil War of 1918\u20131920 Tatar nationalists attempted to establish an independent republic (the Idel-Ural State). They were, however, put down by the Bolsheviks and the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was established on May 27, 1920. The boundaries of the republic did not include a majority of the Volga Tatars. The Tatar Union of the Godless were persecuted in Stalin's 1928 purges.\n\n\n==== 1921\u20131922 famine ====\n\nThere was a famine in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921 to 1922 as a result of war communist policy. The famine deaths of 2,000,000 Tatars in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region in 1921\u20131922 was catastrophic as half of Volga Tatar population in USSR died. This famine is also known as \"terror-famine\" and \"famine-genocide\" in Tatarstan. The Soviets settled ethnic Russians after the famine in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region causing the Tatar share of the population to decline to less than 50%. The All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) has asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921 Tatarstan famine as Genocide of Muslim Tatars. The 1921\u20131922 famine in Tatarstan has been compared to the Holodomor in Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nOn August 30, 1990, Tatarstan announced its sovereignty with the Declaration on the State Sovereignty of the Tatar Soviet Socialist Republic and in 1992 Tatarstan held a referendum on the new constitution. Some 62% of those who took part voted in favor of the constitution. In the 1992 Tatarstan Constitution, Tatarstan is defined as a Sovereign State. However, the referendum and constitution were declared unconstitutional by the Russian Constitutional Court.  Articles 1 and 3 of the Constitution as introduced in 2002 define Tatarstan as a part of the Russian Federation.\nOn February 15, 1994, the Treaty On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Authority between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan and Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan (On Delimitation of Authority in the Sphere of Foreign Economic Relations) were signed. The power-sharing agreement was renewed on July 11, 2007, though with much of the power delegated to Tatarstan reduced.On December 20, 2008, in response to Russia recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Milli Mejlis of the Tatar People declared Tatarstan independent and asked for United Nations recognition. However, this declaration was ignored both by the United Nations and the Russian government. On July 24, 2017, the autonomy agreement signed in 1994 between Moscow and Kazan expired, making Tatarstan the last republic of Russia to lose its special status.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation: 3,786,488\u2009(2010 Census); 3,779,265\u2009(2002 Census); 3,637,809\u2009(1989 Census).\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\n\n\n=== Vital statistics ===\n\nNote: TFR source.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nThere are about 2 million ethnic Tatars and 1.5 million ethnic Russians, along with significant numbers of Chuvash, Mari, and Udmurts, some of whom are Tatar-speaking. The Ukrainian, Mordvin, and Bashkir minorities are also significant. Most Tatars are Sunni Muslims, but a small minority known as Ker\u00e4\u015fen Tatars are Orthodox and some of them regard themselves as being different from other Tatars even though most Ker\u00e4\u015fen dialects differ only slightly from the Central Dialect of the Tatar language.There is a fair degree of speculation as to the early origins of the different groups of Tatars, but most Tatars no longer view religious identity as being as important as it once was, and the religious and linguistic subgroups have intermingled considerably. Nevertheless, despite many decades of assimilation and intermingling, some Ker\u00e4\u015fen demanded and were awarded the option of being specifically enumerated in 2002. This has provoked great controversy, however, as many intellectuals have sought to portray the Tatars as homogeneous and indivisible. Although listed separately below, the Ker\u00e4\u015fen are still included in the grand total for the Tatars. Another unique ethnic group, concentrated in Tatarstan, is the Qaratay Mordvins.\n\n\n=== Jews in Tatarstan ===\n\nTatar and Udmurt Jews are special territorial groups of the Ashkenazi Jews, which started to be formed in the residential areas of mixed Turkic-speaking (Tatars, Kryashens, Bashkirs, Chuvash people), Finno-Ugric-speaking (Udmurts, Mari people) and Slavic-speaking (Russians) population. The Ashkenazi Jews on the territory of Tatarstan first appeared in the 1830s. The Jews of Udmurtia and Tatarstan are subdivided on cultural and linguistic characteristics into two territorial groups: 1) Udmurt Jews (Udmurt Jewry), who lived on the territory of Udmurtia and the north of Tatarstan; 2) Tatar Jews or Kazan Jews (Tatar Jewry or Kazan Jewry), who lived mainly in the city of Kazan and its agglomeration.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the two state languages of the republic are Tatar and Russian. According to the 2002 Russian Federal Law (On Languages of Peoples of the Russian Federation), the official script is Cyrillic. Linguistic anthropologist Dr. Suzanne Wertheim, notes that \"some men signal ideological devotion to the Tatar cause by refusing to accommodate to Russian-dominant public space or Russian speakers\", whilst women, in promoting \"the Tatar state and Tatar national culture, index their pro-Tatar ideological stances more diplomatically, and with linguistic practices situated only within the Tatar-speaking community ... in keeping with normative gender roles within the Tatar republic.\"\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nEstablished in 922, the first Muslim state within the boundaries of modern Russia was Volga Bulgaria from which the Tatars inherited Islam. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922. Islam's long presence in Russia also extends at least as far back as the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, which brought the Tatars and Bashkirs on the Middle Volga into Russia.\n\nIn the 1430s, the region became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars. The Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. Some Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593, mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine II.\nWhen it comes to religion, Islam is the most common faith in Tatarstan, as, 48.8% of the estimated 3.8 million population is Muslim while the remaining population is mostly Russian Orthodox Christian and non-religious.In 1990, there were only 100 mosques but the number, as of 2004, rose to well over 1,000. As of January 1, 2008, as many as 1,398 religious organizations were registered in Tatarstan, of which 1,055 were Muslim. Islam is the most common faith in Tatarstan, as, according one study, 38.8% of the population is Muslim. In September 2010, Eid al-Fitr as well May 21, the day the Volga Bulgars embraced Islam, were made public holidays. Tatarstan also hosted an international Muslim film festival which screened over 70 films from 28 countries including Jordan, Afghanistan, and Egypt.The Russian Orthodox Church is the second largest active religion in Tatarstan, and has been so for more than 150 years, with an estimated 1.6 million followers made up of ethnic Russians, Mordvins, Armenians, Belarusians, Mari people, Georgians, Chuvash and a number of Orthodox Tatars which together constitute 45% of the 3.8 million population of Tatarstan. On 23 August 2010, the \"Orthodox monuments of Tatarstan\" exhibition was held in Kazan by the Tatarstan Ministry of Culture and the Kazan Eparchy. At all public events, an Orthodox Priest is called upon along with an Islamic Mufti.The Muslim Religious Board of Tatarstan frequently organizes activities, like the 'Islamic graffiti Contest' which was held on November 20, 2011.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe head of the government in Tatarstan is the President.  Since March 2010, the President has been Rustam Minnikhanov. Tatarstan's unicameral State Council has 100 seats: fifty are for representatives of the parties, and the other fifty are for deputies from the republic's localities. The Chairman of the State Council is Farit Mukhametshin since May 27, 1998. The government is the \u0421abinet of Ministers. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Tatarstan is Alexei Pesoshin.\nAccording to the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the President can be elected only by the people of Tatarstan, but due to Russian federal law, this law was suspended for an indefinite term. The Russian law on the election of governors says they should be elected by regional parliaments and that the candidate can be presented only by the president of Russia.\nOn March 25, 2005 Shaymiyev was re-elected for his fourth term by the State Council. This election was held after changes in electoral law and does not contradict the Constitutions of Tatarstan and Russia.\n\n\n=== Political status ===\n\nThe Republic of Tatarstan is a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Most of the Russian federal subjects are tied with the Russian federal government by the uniform Federal Treaty, but relations between the government of Tatarstan and the Russian federal government are more complex and are precisely defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan.  The following passage from the Constitution defines the republic's status without contradicting the Constitution of the Russian Federation:\n\"The Republic of Tatarstan is a democratic constitutional State associated with the Russian Federation by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Powers between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan, and a subject of the Russian Federation. The sovereignty of the Republic of Tatarstan shall consist in full possession of the State authority (legislative, executive and judicial) beyond the competence of the Russian Federation and powers of the Russian Federation in the sphere of shared competence of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan and shall be an inalienable qualitative status of the Republic of Tatarstan.\"\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTatarstan is one of the most economically developed regions of Russia. The republic is highly industrialized and ranks second to Samara Oblast in terms of industrial production per km2. in 2017 Tatarstan's GDP per capita was $10,000, with total GDP at about $35 billion.The region's main source of wealth is oil. Tatarstan produces 32 million tonnes of crude oil per year and has estimated oil reserves of more than 1 billion tons. Industrial production constitutes 45% of the Republic's gross regional domestic product. The most developed manufacturing industries are petrochemical industry and machine building. The truck-maker KamAZ is the region's largest enterprise and employs about one-fifth of Tatarstan's workforce. Kazanorgsintez, based in Kazan, is one of Russia's largest chemical companies. Tatarstan's aviation industry produces Tu-214 passenger airplanes and helicopters. The Kazan Helicopter Plant is one of the largest helicopter manufacturers in the world. Engineering, textiles, clothing, wood processing, and food industries are also of key significance in Tatarstan.\n\nTatarstan consists of three distinct industrial regions. The northwestern part is an old industrial region where engineering, chemical, and light industry dominate. In the newly industrial northeast region with its core in the Naberezhnye Chelny\u2013Nizhnekamsk agglomeration, major industries are automobile construction, the chemical industry, and power engineering. The southeast region has oil production with engineering under development. The north, central, south, and southwest parts of the republic are rural regions. The republic has huge water resources\u2014the annual flow of rivers of the Republic exceeds 240 billion m3 (8.5 trillion cu ft). Soils are very diverse, the best fertile soils covering one-third of the territory. Due to the high development of agriculture in Tatarstan (it contributes 5.1% of the total revenue of the republic), forests occupy only 16% of its territory. The agricultural sector of the economy is represented mostly by large companies as \"Ak Bars Holding\" and \"Krasniy Vostok Agro\".\nThe republic has a highly developed transport network. It mainly comprises highways, railway lines, four navigable rivers \u2014 Volga (\u0130del), Kama (\u00c7ulman), Vyatka (Noqrat) and Belaya (A\u011fidel), and oil pipelines and airlines. The territory of Tatarstan is crossed by the main gas pipelines carrying natural gas from Urengoy and Yamburg to the west and the major oil pipelines supplying oil to various cities in the European part of Russia.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThere are three UNESCO world heritage sites in Tatarstan-Kazan Kremlin, Bulgarian state Museum-reserve and assumption Cathedral and Monastery of the town-island of Sviyazhsk.The annual growth rate of tourist flow to the republic is on average 13.5%, the growth rate of the volume of services in the tourism sector is 17.0%.At the end of 2016 on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan there were 104 tour operators, of which 32 dealt in domestic tourism, 65 in domestic and inbound tourism, 1 in domestic and outbound tourism, and 6 in all three.As of January 1, 2017, 404 collective accommodation facilities (CSR) operate in the Republic of Tatarstan, 379 CSR are subject to classification (183 in Kazan, 196 in other municipalities of the Republic of Tatarstan). 334 collective accommodation facilities received the certificate of assignment of the category, which is 88.1% of the total number of operating.\nIn 2016, special attention was paid to the development of tourist centers of the Republic of Tatarstan \u2013 Kazan, Bolghar, the town-island of Sviyazhsk, Yelabuga, Chistopol, Tetyushi.

The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme aims to create spaces for meeting or recreation. The programme covers a wide spectrum of projects, including streets, squares, parks, river banks, pavilions, and sports facilities.Since 2016 (and continuing until 2022), the Architecturny Desant Architectural Bureau in Kazan is improving public spaces in each of Tatarstan's 45 municipal districts, from large cities to small villages. As of April 2019, the project had revamped 328 public spaces. By creating and rehabilitating public spaces, the programme aims to be a catalyst for positive social, economic, and environmental change.One notable example is the \"Beach\" at Almetyevsk, which includes public swimming pools and a terrace. Other examples include an amphitheatre in Black Lake Park, Kazan; the Central Square in Bavly; a children's playground in Bogatye Saby village, which has a unique wooden play structure; the Cube container centre in the green beach at Gorkinsko-Ometievsky forest, Kazan; and the square on Festival Boulevard, Kazan.The programme used an innovative participatory design approach, which later became mandatory for similar projects across Russia. This approach partners specialists with local residents at every stage of the project, from development, to implementation, to the ongoing use of the space.The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme was announced as one of the six winners of the 2019 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The jury was impressed by the programme's systematic approach and involvement of residents to decide the future of each space.Each public space expresses the unique identity of that particular place, tying in its history while incorporating traditional materials. Major goals of the projects include improving the quality of life for residents and improving the environment. The Arhitekturnyi Desant team aims to provide a high quality public space, no matter the size of the settlement, including quality design, infrastructure, and materials.Spending on the public spaces projects is helping the local economy.

In 1925, the university was renamed in honour of its most famous student Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin). The university is known as the birthplace of organic chemistry due to works by Aleksandr Butlerov, Vladimir Markovnikov, Aleksandr Arbuzov, and the birthplace of electron spin resonance discovered by Evgeny Zavoisky.\nIn 2010, Kazan University received a federal status. It is also one of 15 Russian universities that were initially selected to participate in the Project 5-100, coordinated by the Government of the Russian Federation and aimed to improve their international competitiveness among the world\u2019s leading research and educational centers.As of January 2020, the University comprises 18 primary educational units, 2 of which are territorial branches. More than 50,000 students are enrolled in over 600 degree programs at undergraduate and postgraduate level (including doctoral and double-degree programs with partner universities); the number of international students is about 9,700 from 106 countries.Research priority areas are concentrated on biomedicine and pharmaceutics, oil extraction, oil refining and petrochemistry, communications and aerospace technologies, advanced materials, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n\n== History ==\nAmong the subjects of special pride are the creation of non-Euclidean geometry by Nikolai Lobachevsky, the discovery of the chemical element Ruthenium by Karl Klauss, the theory of chemical structure of organic compounds by Aleksandr Butlerov, the discovery of electron paramagnetic resonance by Yevgeny Zavoisky and acoustic paramagnetic resonance by Semen Altshuler, the development of organophosphorus chemical compounds by Alexander and Boris Arbuzovs and many others.\nSince its inception, the university has prepared more than 70 thousand professionals. Among the university students and alumni there are outstanding scholars and famous people such as the founder of the Soviet Union Vladimir Lenin, writers Sergei Aksakov, Leo Tolstoy, Pavel Melnikov-Pechersky, Velimir Khlebnikov, composer Mily Balakirev, and painter Valery Yakobi.\n\n\n=== Imperial period ===\n\nKazan University, one of the oldest universities in Russia, was founded on November 17, 1804, when Emperor Alexander I signed the Affirmative Letter and the Charter about the creation of the Kazan Imperial University. The first students, enrolled in 1805, were graduates of the First Kazan Gymnasium \u2013 an autonomous affiliate of Moscow State University, under whose auspices Kazan University first operated.\nIt was not until 1814 that the university underwent its full opening. It was restructured as a classical university comprising four departments: moral and political sciences, physical and mathematical sciences, medical sciences and philology. Before Tomsk University was founded, the University of Kazan used to be the easternmost university in the Russian Empire, it was thus serving for Volga, Kama, and Ural regions, Siberia and the Caucasus.\nIn 1819, M. L. Magnitsky conducted a review of the university, in which he reported on 'the spirit of dissent and irreligion' that he had observed at the university. In his report to the Emperor, he spoke of the \"public destruction\" of the university and demanded it be closed, but Alexander I put the resolved 'why destroy what can be corrected'. Magnitsky was consequently appointed trustee of the Kazan school district, an action that negatively affected the university, with many professors being dismissed and 'harmful' books withdrawn from the library's collection. In addition, a strict barrack domestic regime was introduced for students of the university.\n\nIn 1819\u20131821 an alumnus and scholar of Kazan University Ivan Simonov participated in the discovery of Antarctica during the first round-the-world expedition and pioneered Antarctic studies.\nIn 1825, the Main Building of the university was built and, in 1830, the Main Campus was completed. This included the Library Building, Chemical Laboratory, dissection facilities, astronomical observatory, and clinics (in the organisation of which contemporaries noted the leading role of Professor Franz Yellachich). Resultantly the university became a leading centre of education and science. It was the scientific faculties that were, at this time, organised into a number of research schools: mathematical, chemical, medical, geological.\nSince the first half of the 19th century Kazan University has been the largest center of Oriental Studies in Europe and the birthplace of the world-famous Kazan Linguistic School founded by Jan Baudouin de Courtenay.\nJust four years later, in 1834, the journal Proceedings of Kazan University began to be published by academicians of the university and in 1835 Nicholas I ordered to establish three faculties: Philosophical (which was further subdivided into verbal and physical-mathematical departments), Faculty of Law and Faculty of Medicine.\n\nIn 1844, Karl Klaus, a professor at the university, discovered, and named in honour of Russia, Ruthenium, the only chemical element discovered in Tsarist Russia. Six years thereafter St. Petersburg University opened the Institute of Oriental Studies and all training materials and collections of Kazan University in this field were transferred to the capital of Imperial Russia. Shortly after that, there was a further reform of the university's structure, when in 1863, by the order of Alexander II, the university was reorganised into four departments: History and Philology, Physics and Mathematics, Law, and Medicine. A renowned linguistic school was forming at the university during 1875\u20131883.\nAround that time Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin), a future leader of the Soviet Union, studied law at the university from August 1887 until his expulsion due to 'student disturbances' in December 1887.The university faced one of its greatest challenges during the Russian Civil War, when in August\u2013September 1918 the siege and ultimate capture of Kazan by the Red Army and Czechoslovak Corps led to a large exodus of students and faculty members from the city. Subsequently, many of them were enrolled in state universities in Siberia and help they provided proved instrumental in the foundation of universities in Tomsk and Irkutsk.\n\n\n==== Kazan Higher Women's Courses ====\nThough approval was given in the Imperial period for Women to audit university lectures from 1859, the Higher Courses were not state funded and required local support, carrying high tuition fees. When petitioned by the university to create courses for women, Dmitry Tolstoy suggested that a curriculum modeled on the Guerrier Courses might be acceptable, though he continuously blocked their implementation in Kazan. In 1876, the imperial government, hoping to secure more qualified teachers, authorized creation of Higher Women's Courses in all cities in the empire which had a university. From October 1876, female applicants who had completed a girls' gymnasium; were certified instructors in arithmetic, history and Russian language; or passed an entrance examination could enroll in evening classes at Kazan University. Those who did not meet those requirements could attend as external auditors, but were excluded from course examinations. Students took six mandatory courses in art history, physics, Russian history and literature, and world history and literature. Optional courses included hygiene, languages, and mathematics.In 1879, the founder of the Kazan Higher Women's Courses, N. V. Sorokin, expanded the offerings to include two specializations: \"historical-philological and physico-mathematical\". This opened up additional course offerings including algebra and geometry, chemistry, English language, German literature, geography, history of philosophy, history of physical and mathematical sciences, history of physics, and natural sciences. In 1881, aesthetics was added and in 1884, Latin began being offered as an elective class. The courses allowed women to access higher education for a decade before being permanently closed in 1886. In 1904, professors of the university formed a committee to reinstate the women's courses, but the plan was rejected because of it was economically not feasible. The plan was refused again in 1905, but in 1906, after the Revolution, authorities allowed the university to reinstate the Higher Women's Courses of the historical-philological department. The first Latvian to earn a degree in Folkloric Studies, Anna B\u0113rzkalne, graduated as a Candidate of Philology from the Kazan Higher Women's Courses in 1917.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nIn accordance with a directive from the Council of People's Commissars issued on October 9, 1918, the system of academic ranks was abolished and all university-level lecturers with at least three years of teaching experience were qualifying for the title of professor. This allowed the University of Kazan, which had lost the vast majority of its academic staff during the turmoil of the civil war, to restart proper education and research.\n\nThe university soon opened a 'workers' faculty (fifth in the RSFSR), which aimed to provide the education for peasants. On 1 November 1919 peasant workers started their first classes without the requirement to pass an entrance exam. In 1922 the University's Faculty of Forestry merged with the Faculty of Agriculture of Kazan Polytechnic university to form Kazan Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.\nIn 1925 by the decision of All-Russian Central Executive Committee Kazan State University was renamed to the V. I. Ulyanov-Lenin Kazan State University.  This was done in order to recognise the period of time Vladimir Lenin spent as a student at the University of Kazan.\nIn the 1930s the university continued to evolve with a number of its faculties being separated from it in order to become independent institutions of higher education. Some of them continue their existence, for instance Kazan State Medical University. Moreover, during the World War II years (1941\u20131943) a number of members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences were evacuated from Moscow and Leningrad and housed under the premises of the university; this, in turn, led to the foundation of Kazan Department of the Academy in 1945.\nIn the post-war years the University of Kazan underwent a period of rapid expansion and development of its academic base. To recognize the hard work in providing education to the peoples of the Soviet Union Kazan State University was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1953 and later, in 1979, the Order of Lenin. In the 1970s the University's two distinctive high-rise academic buildings were built \u2013 the Department of Physics in 1973 and Faculty of Mathematics in 1978. The final major Soviet-era change to the university came with the opening of UNICS Sports Center and Concert Hall in 1989.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nOn October 21, 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a presidential decree that established a new Volga Federal University on the basis of Kazan State University. The federal university project is realized on the basis of Kazan State University, with the accession of the Tatar State University of Humanities and Education (TGGPU), Kazan State Finance and Economics Institute (KGFEI), Elabuga State Pedagogical University and Naberezhnye Chelny Academy of Engineering and Economy. The university's first rector is Ilshat Gafurov, formerly the mayor of Elabuga. The current president is Myakzyum Salakhov.\nIn 2013 Kazan Federal University launched the Programme for enhancing its competitive ranking among leading world centres of higher education and research (2013\u20132020) in the framework of implementation of the Government Resolution \u2116 211 \u00abOn measures of federal support for the leading universities of the Russian Federation in order to enhance their competitiveness among the leading world scientific and educational centers\u00bb (signed on 16 March 2013).\n\n\n== Rankings and reputation ==\nAfter having obtained the status of a federal university, KFU tasked itself with advancing in the global rankings race. This is also the primary metric for the participants of the Project 5-100, a national initiative to boost the competitiveness of the top Russian universities, which Kazan University joined in 2013.The university has been ranked by QS World University Rankings since 2012, steadily climbing from 601+ to 392nd place. It also has 4 stars in QS Stars Ratings, along with another institution from Tatarstan, Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.N.Tupolev.It\u2019s currently ranked 601 \u2013 800 by Times Higher Education. It\u2019s also in the 201-300 bracket in University Impact and Good health and well-being rankings by the same organization.\nKFU first appeared in Academic Ranking of World Universities in 2018 and was ranked 801 \u2013 900 in that year and in 2019.\nThe university is present in 10 subject areas in QS subject rankings and in 7 areas in Times Higher Education rankings. The most notable achievement is 94th place in THE subject rankings for Education in 2019.In Russian national rankings, Kazan University has been consistently ranked among the best, including 16th place in RAEX rankings and 9th place in Interfax National Ranking of Universities.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nKazan Federal University\u2019s Main Campus is located in downtown Kazan, 10 minutes away from the Kazan Kremlin.\nThe Main Building of Kazan University was designed by architect Petr Pyatnitsky and built in the 1820s. The oldest part of the today\u2019s Main Building includes three classic portals along with the white foreside of the original 1822 construction.\nFrom 1832 to 1841, architect M. Korinfsky designed the rest of the buildings comprising the neo-classical Architectural Complex of Kazan University. The Main Building Yard now contains the central administrative offices, the Anatomical Theatre, the Library, chemistry and physics laboratories, and the Observatory.\nChemical Faculty Building (since 2003: Alexander Butlerov Chemistry Institute) was built in 1953 with the support of students. The original building was built in the Soviet neoclassical style. In 1960-70s, two high-rise academic buildings were erected to the north and to the west of the Main Building. The most recent addition was in 2015, when a 7-storey laboratory building was added to the campus.\nBy President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s Decree in 1996 the Architectural Complex of Kazan University was added to the National Cultural Heritage Register of Russia. During the preparations for 200th anniversary of KFU the East Wing was added to the Main Building and today along with the university administration, the Museum of History of Kazan University, Yevgeny Zavoisky Lab-Museum, the Botanical Museum, Edward Eversman Zoology Museum, and two academic units \u2013 the Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology together with the Faculty of Law reside there.\nUniversity sport facilities include UNICS and Bustan Sports Centers built in 1989 and 2010.\nKFU is one of just few educational institutions in Russia which offers modern comfortable housing to all students outside of Kazan. KFU dormitory campus is located in the Universiade Village built to accommodate participants of the XXVII World Summer Universiade 2013. It is a residential micro-district for about 12,000 people with a medical center, drugstore, sports equipment rent station, copy center, laundry, beauty salon, cafeteria and other facilities available. The Village project was awarded a diploma \"For a special contribution to a socially significant infrastructure creation for youth and sport development\" at the world contest FIABCI Prix D\u2019Excellence.\nAltogether the premises of Kazan University are located throughout Russia in Tatarstan, Karachay-Cherkessia, Karelia, Mari El and Samara region (Tolyatti).\n\nBuildings of the Kazan State University\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Main Campus of Kazan Federal University located in Kazan is divided into 16 institutes, 3 Higher Schools and two faculties. The university also has two branches in Naberezhnye Chelny and Yelabuga.\nThe university offers the majority of its programs in Russian. Prospective students who do not speak Russian are required to participate in a one-year language training course at KFU International Preparatory School. Teaching in English is provided for several programs throughout the university at Specialist and Master levels.\nPhysics, Mathematics and IT\n\nInstitute of Physics\nN.I.

Some of the University's first teachers were German professors such as Johann Bartels, Franz Erdman and Christian Fren. The famous German professor Karl Fuchs, who was both the founder of Kazan Medical School and the first European researcher of Tatar history and culture, became the University's rector in the 1820s and was awarded the title of Honourable Citizen of Kazan.\nKFU has partner agreements with approximately 190 universities and research centres from more than 53 countries all over the world. Thanks to its fruitful cooperation with the long-term partners such as Justus-Liebig University of Giessen (Germany), the Superior Institute of Materials and Advance Mechanics (ISMANS, France), Research Institute RIKEN (Japan) and many others, KFU has taken advantage of participating in various research programmes and implementing double diploma programs and cotutelle agreements.\nCurrently (2015\u20132016 academic year), about 3000 international students are studying in KFU on different academic programmes.Each year, more than 900 students and faculty members of KFU visit foreign universities and research centres for various purposes, including international conferences. About 1500 specialists from abroad are involved in various scientific events, development and introduction of new courses, research collaboration and other international activity at KFU. Many native speaking specialists teach Chinese, Korean, Farsi, German, Spanish, English and other foreign languages on a regular basis at KFU. Among the honorary doctors and professors of KFU there are Vladimir Minkin, Alexei Starobinsky, Ichak Kalderon Adizes, Rashid Sunyaev, Anatole Abragam, Karl Alexander M\u00fcller, Brebis Bleaney, Ryoji Noyori, Mikhail Piotrovsky, Vitaly Ginzburg,  Marat Yusupov and other famous scientists and Nobel prizers.\nEvery year KFU academic staff carry out on average 40 joint international projects and get individual support for research and study from DAAD, DFG, Volkswagen Foundation, NSF, European Commission (Tempus, FP7, Marie-Curie Actions, Erasmus-Mundus, etc.) and other grant making organizations.\nKFU carry out several big projects on Mega-grants received from the Russian Government in the framework of Resolution No.220 of the Government of the Russian Federation \"On measures designed to attract the world\u2019s leading scientists to Russian institutions of higher learning, research organizations of the governmental academies of sciences, and governmental research centers of the Russian Federation\"  and Resolution No 218 of the Government of the Russian Federation \"On promoting cooperation between higher educational institutions and organizations implementing comprehensive high-technology production\": \n\nInternational research laboratory \"Neurobiology. Early activity in the developing brain\" supervised by prof. Rustem Khazipov. The project is implemented jointly with the Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM)  (France);\nJoint project of KFU and \u00abNizhnekamskneftekhim\u00bb: \"Increasing effectiveness for obtaining monomers of synthetic rubber by development and distribution of advanced catalysts of isoamylene dehydration\".\nJoint project of KFU and TNG Group: \u00abDevelopment of innovative technologies and industrial management of equipment and software for effective investigation of resources for the purpose of identification of hydrocarbon deposits and supervision of their development\u00bb.\nJoint project of KFU and \"Tasma\" Co.: \"Development and Production of competitive photorecording materials\".Starting from 2011 Kazan University implements a large-scale project \"Pharma 2020\" financed within Federal Target Program of Russian Federation  \"Development of pharmaceutical and medical industry till 2020 and following perspectives\" (Pharma-2020).  Research and Education Center of Pharmaceutics was established providing interdisciplinary research for development and production of innovative drugs.\nThe University administration and faculty have paid special attention to the European Tempus and Erasmus scheme for cooperation, with over a dozen large-scale projects which have been successfully implemented during the last 20 years. Today KFU students and academic staff enjoy wonderful opportunities of training at best European universities as part of both \"Integration, Interaction and Institutions (Triple I)\" and \"Aurora\" projects (Erasmus Mundus program). These projects often reach beyond the University, making it a centre of entirely new regional research and educational networks involved in international collaboration.\n\n\n== Library ==\n\nKazan University Nikolai Lobachevsky Scientific Library has one of the world's most important bibliographical collections, including 15,000 manuscripts and 3,000 rare books. Opened in 1809, it first contained Count G. Potemkin's books brought to Kazan in 1799 mixed with collections of the earliest bibliophiles V. Polyansky and N. Bulich. Subsequently, the collections of Solovetsky Monastery were added to the library.\nThese original books remain and are kept in the special depository of the library. In this special collection are Arabic manuscripts of philosophers and scholars Mansur Al-Hallaj and Avicenna (11th century) and Ashshakhrestani (12th century), a manuscript copy of the Pentateuch, the first Russian printed book \"The Apostle\" (1564), the \"Books of Kingdoms\" by Francisco Skorin (1518) and the \"Code of Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich\" (1649). The Library has first editions of the 18th-century books by Pushkin, Griboyedov, Gogol, Nas\u00edri and Tuqay.\nThe library contains many 19th-century periodicals, and literature about Kazan and the surrounding region. The library boasts itself as \"the pride of the University and an invaluable source of information for any researcher.\" The original library building was built between 1825 and 1833 by Rector N. Lobachevsky, who was at the same time the chief librarian of the university. The library, which now bears his name, is still growing, and even its new building cannot house all the collections. Kazan University also has many museums.\n\n\n== Notable faculty and alumni ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nSergey Aksakov, Vladmir Ulyanov (Vladimir Lenin) (expelled), Alexei Rykov, X\u00f6s\u00e4yen Yama\u015fev, Sergei Bakinsky, Vasili Osipanov, Nikolai Semashko, Dmitry Karakozov, Nikolay Fyodorov.\n\n\n=== Mathematics and sciences ===\nAleksandr Arbuzov, Nikolai Chebotaryov, Aleksandr Butlerov, Naum Meiman, Kimal Akishev, Nikolay Lobachevski, Ivan Simonov, Vladimir Markovnikov, Konstantin Mereschkowski, Nikolay Beketov, Nikolay Zinin, Alexander Zaytsev, Sergey Reformatsky, Alexander Vishnevsky, Liverij Darkshevich, Platon Poretsky, Nikolai Brashman, Karl Ernst Claus, Joseph Johann Littrow, Johann Bartels, Adolph Theodor Kupffer, Marian Kowalski, Aleksandr Kotelnikov, Mikhail Lavrentyev, Yevgeny Zavoisky, Roald Sagdeev, Vladimir Engelgardt, Alexander Luria, Dmitry Dubyago, Alexander Dubyago, Georgii Frederiks, Semen Altshuler, Mikhail Lyapunov, Dmitrii Sintsov, Oskar Anderson, Wilhelm Anderson, Vladimir Galkin, Kadir Timergazin, Vladimir Moskovkin, Emmanuel Rashba.\n\n\n=== Music and art ===\nMily Balakirev, Stanislav Govorukhin, Ilya Ulyanov, Stepan Smolensky, Karl Fuchs,  Michael Minsky (Spirin), Yuliya Zaripova, Oleg Saitov.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nPavel Melnikov-Pechersky, Velimir Khlebnikov, Pyotr Boborykin, Eugenia Ginzburg, Leo Tolstoy, Daniil Mordovtsev, Alexander Tarasov-Rodionov.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nJan Niecis\u0142aw Baudouin de Courtenay, Vladimir Bekhterev, Miko\u0142aj Kruszewski, Ivan Yakovlev, Vladimir Burtsev, Peter Lesgaft, Sergey Malov, Nikolay Ilminsky, Afanasy Shchapov, Christian Martin Fr\u00e4hn, Alexander Kazembek, Nicolai A.

          "If you really want to know the real Kazan then you have to spend lots of time there. It has lots of cafes, bars, restaurants, shops of all kinds. There's always someone who's playing music for money and you can easily make friends or just talk to friendly strangers while",

          "I would say that the street is cute but something was lacking during our visit. Either it's the absence of small cafes & restaurants open outside of typical working hours that's from 9/10 to 8/9, or it's about not many people walking along it what can be related to summer time.",
          "The main pedestrian street in the heart of Kazan is always full of people 'cos anyone can find here what one's heart desires: shopping malls and souvenir shops, clubs, cafes, fountaines and museums. You can hear the amature singers, meet street dancers or enjoy the fireshow. And",

Its capital is the city of Kazan.\nThe republic borders Kirov, Ulyanovsk, Samara, and Orenburg Oblasts, the Mari El, Udmurt, and Chuvash Republics, and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The area of the republic is 68,000 square kilometres (26,000 sq mi). The unofficial Tatarstan motto is Bez Buld\u0131rab\u0131z! (We can!). As of the 2010 Census, the population of Tatarstan was 3,786,488.The state has strong cultural ties with its eastern neighbor, the Republic of Bashkortostan.The state languages of the Republic of Tatarstan are Tatar and Russian.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\"Tatarstan\" derives from the name of the ethnic group\u2014the Tatars\u2014and the Persian suffix -stan (meaning \"state\" or \"country\" of, an ending common to many Eurasian countries). Another version of the Russian name is \"\u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0438\u044f\" (Tatariya), which was official along with \"Tatar ASSR\" during Soviet rule.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe republic is located in the center of the East European Plain, approximately 800 kilometers (500 mi) east of Moscow.  It lies between the Volga River and the Kama River (a tributary of the Volga), and extends east to the Ural mountains.\n\nBorders:\ninternal: Kirov Oblast (N), Udmurt Republic (N/NE), Republic of Bashkortostan (E/SE), Orenburg Oblast (SE), Samara Oblast (S), Ulyanovsk Oblast (S/SW), Chuvash Republic (W), Mari El Republic (W/NW).\nHighest point: 381 m (1,250 ft)\nMaximum N\u2013S distance: 290 km (180 mi)\nMaximum E\u2013W distance: 460 km (290 mi)\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\n\nMajor rivers include (Tatar names are given in parentheses):\n\nAzevka River (\u00c4zi)\nBelaya River (A\u011fidel)\nIk River (Iq)\nKama River (\u00c7ulman)\nVolga River (\u0130del)\nVyatka River (Noqrat)\nKazanka River (Qazansu)\nZay River (Z\u00e4y)\n\n\n=== Lakes ===\nMajor reservoirs of the republic include (Tatar names are given in parentheses):\n\nKuybyshev Reservoir (Kuyb\u0131\u015fev)\nLower Kama Reservoir (T\u00fcb\u00e4n Kama)\nZainsk Reservoir (Z\u00e4y susaqla\u011f\u0131\u00e7\u0131)The biggest lake is Qaban. The biggest swamp is Kulyagash.\n\n\n=== Hills ===\nBugulma-Belebey Upland\nVolga Upland\nVyatskie Uvaly\n\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nMajor natural resources of Tatarstan include oil, natural gas, gypsum, and more.  It is estimated that the Republic has over one billion tons of oil deposits.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAverage January temperature: \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F)\nAverage July temperature: +18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F)\nAverage annual temperature: +4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F)\nAverage annual precipitation: up to 500 to 550 mm (20 to 22 in)\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nAdministrative and territorial division: 43 municipal districts and 2 urban districts (Kazan and Naberezhnye Chelny), as well as 39 urban settlements and 872 rural settlements.\nThe Republic of Tatarstan consists of districts and cities of republican significance, the list of which is established by the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan. The districts consist of cities of district significance, urban-type settlements and rural settlements with subordinate territories that make up the primary level in the system of administrative-territorial structure of the Republic. Cities of national significance can be geographically divided into districts in the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe earliest known organized state within the boundaries of Tatarstan was Volga Bulgaria (c. 700\u20131238). The Volga Bulgars had an advanced mercantile state with trade contacts throughout Inner Eurasia, the Middle East, and the Baltic, which maintained its independence despite pressure by such nations as the Khazars, the Kievan Rus, and the Cuman-Kipchaks. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922.\n\nVolga Bulgaria finally fell to the armies of the Mongol prince Batu Khan in the late 1230s (see Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria). The inhabitants, mixing with the Golden Horde's Kipchak-speaking people, became known as the \"Volga Tatars\". Another theory postulates that there were no ethnic changes in that period, and Bulgars simply switched to the Kipchak-based Tatar language. In the 1430s, the region again became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km (110 mi) up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars.\nThe Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. A large number of Bulgars were killed and forcibly converted to Christianity and were culturally Russified. Cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593 all mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine the Great. The first mosque to be rebuilt under Catherine's auspices was constructed in 1766\u20131770.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the 19th century, Tatarstan became a center of Jadidism, an Islamic movement that preached tolerance of other religions. Under the influence of local Jadidist theologians, the Bulgars were renowned for their friendly relations with other peoples of the Russian Empire. However, after the October Revolution religion was largely outlawed and all theologians were repressed.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nDuring the Civil War of 1918\u20131920 Tatar nationalists attempted to establish an independent republic (the Idel-Ural State). They were, however, put down by the Bolsheviks and the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was established on May 27, 1920. The boundaries of the republic did not include a majority of the Volga Tatars. The Tatar Union of the Godless were persecuted in Stalin's 1928 purges.\n\n\n==== 1921\u20131922 famine ====\n\nThere was a famine in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921 to 1922 as a result of war communist policy. The famine deaths of 2,000,000 Tatars in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region in 1921\u20131922 was catastrophic as half of Volga Tatar population in USSR died. This famine is also known as \"terror-famine\" and \"famine-genocide\" in Tatarstan. The Soviets settled ethnic Russians after the famine in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region causing the Tatar share of the population to decline to less than 50%. The All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) has asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921 Tatarstan famine as Genocide of Muslim Tatars. The 1921\u20131922 famine in Tatarstan has been compared to the Holodomor in Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nOn August 30, 1990, Tatarstan announced its sovereignty with the Declaration on the State Sovereignty of the Tatar Soviet Socialist Republic and in 1992 Tatarstan held a referendum on the new constitution. Some 62% of those who took part voted in favor of the constitution. In the 1992 Tatarstan Constitution, Tatarstan is defined as a Sovereign State. However, the referendum and constitution were declared unconstitutional by the Russian Constitutional Court.  Articles 1 and 3 of the Constitution as introduced in 2002 define Tatarstan as a part of the Russian Federation.\nOn February 15, 1994, the Treaty On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Authority between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan and Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan (On Delimitation of Authority in the Sphere of Foreign Economic Relations) were signed. The power-sharing agreement was renewed on July 11, 2007, though with much of the power delegated to Tatarstan reduced.On December 20, 2008, in response to Russia recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Milli Mejlis of the Tatar People declared Tatarstan independent and asked for United Nations recognition. However, this declaration was ignored both by the United Nations and the Russian government. On July 24, 2017, the autonomy agreement signed in 1994 between Moscow and Kazan expired, making Tatarstan the last republic of Russia to lose its special status.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation: 3,786,488\u2009(2010 Census); 3,779,265\u2009(2002 Census); 3,637,809\u2009(1989 Census).\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\n\n\n=== Vital statistics ===\n\nNote: TFR source.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nThere are about 2 million ethnic Tatars and 1.5 million ethnic Russians, along with significant numbers of Chuvash, Mari, and Udmurts, some of whom are Tatar-speaking. The Ukrainian, Mordvin, and Bashkir minorities are also significant. Most Tatars are Sunni Muslims, but a small minority known as Ker\u00e4\u015fen Tatars are Orthodox and some of them regard themselves as being different from other Tatars even though most Ker\u00e4\u015fen dialects differ only slightly from the Central Dialect of the Tatar language.There is a fair degree of speculation as to the early origins of the different groups of Tatars, but most Tatars no longer view religious identity as being as important as it once was, and the religious and linguistic subgroups have intermingled considerably. Nevertheless, despite many decades of assimilation and intermingling, some Ker\u00e4\u015fen demanded and were awarded the option of being specifically enumerated in 2002. This has provoked great controversy, however, as many intellectuals have sought to portray the Tatars as homogeneous and indivisible. Although listed separately below, the Ker\u00e4\u015fen are still included in the grand total for the Tatars. Another unique ethnic group, concentrated in Tatarstan, is the Qaratay Mordvins.\n\n\n=== Jews in Tatarstan ===\n\nTatar and Udmurt Jews are special territorial groups of the Ashkenazi Jews, which started to be formed in the residential areas of mixed Turkic-speaking (Tatars, Kryashens, Bashkirs, Chuvash people), Finno-Ugric-speaking (Udmurts, Mari people) and Slavic-speaking (Russians) population. The Ashkenazi Jews on the territory of Tatarstan first appeared in the 1830s. The Jews of Udmurtia and Tatarstan are subdivided on cultural and linguistic characteristics into two territorial groups: 1) Udmurt Jews (Udmurt Jewry), who lived on the territory of Udmurtia and the north of Tatarstan; 2) Tatar Jews or Kazan Jews (Tatar Jewry or Kazan Jewry), who lived mainly in the city of Kazan and its agglomeration.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the two state languages of the republic are Tatar and Russian. According to the 2002 Russian Federal Law (On Languages of Peoples of the Russian Federation), the official script is Cyrillic. Linguistic anthropologist Dr. Suzanne Wertheim, notes that \"some men signal ideological devotion to the Tatar cause by refusing to accommodate to Russian-dominant public space or Russian speakers\", whilst women, in promoting \"the Tatar state and Tatar national culture, index their pro-Tatar ideological stances more diplomatically, and with linguistic practices situated only within the Tatar-speaking community ... in keeping with normative gender roles within the Tatar republic.\"\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nEstablished in 922, the first Muslim state within the boundaries of modern Russia was Volga Bulgaria from which the Tatars inherited Islam. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922. Islam's long presence in Russia also extends at least as far back as the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, which brought the Tatars and Bashkirs on the Middle Volga into Russia.\n\nIn the 1430s, the region became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars. The Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. Some Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593, mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine II.\nWhen it comes to religion, Islam is the most common faith in Tatarstan, as, 48.8% of the estimated 3.8 million population is Muslim while the remaining population is mostly Russian Orthodox Christian and non-religious.In 1990, there were only 100 mosques but the number, as of 2004, rose to well over 1,000. As of January 1, 2008, as many as 1,398 religious organizations were registered in Tatarstan, of which 1,055 were Muslim. Islam is the most common faith in Tatarstan, as, according one study, 38.8% of the population is Muslim. In September 2010, Eid al-Fitr as well May 21, the day the Volga Bulgars embraced Islam, were made public holidays. Tatarstan also hosted an international Muslim film festival which screened over 70 films from 28 countries including Jordan, Afghanistan, and Egypt.The Russian Orthodox Church is the second largest active religion in Tatarstan, and has been so for more than 150 years, with an estimated 1.6 million followers made up of ethnic Russians, Mordvins, Armenians, Belarusians, Mari people, Georgians, Chuvash and a number of Orthodox Tatars which together constitute 45% of the 3.8 million population of Tatarstan. On 23 August 2010, the \"Orthodox monuments of Tatarstan\" exhibition was held in Kazan by the Tatarstan Ministry of Culture and the Kazan Eparchy. At all public events, an Orthodox Priest is called upon along with an Islamic Mufti.The Muslim Religious Board of Tatarstan frequently organizes activities, like the 'Islamic graffiti Contest' which was held on November 20, 2011.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe head of the government in Tatarstan is the President.  Since March 2010, the President has been Rustam Minnikhanov. Tatarstan's unicameral State Council has 100 seats: fifty are for representatives of the parties, and the other fifty are for deputies from the republic's localities. The Chairman of the State Council is Farit Mukhametshin since May 27, 1998. The government is the \u0421abinet of Ministers. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Tatarstan is Alexei Pesoshin.\nAccording to the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the President can be elected only by the people of Tatarstan, but due to Russian federal law, this law was suspended for an indefinite term. The Russian law on the election of governors says they should be elected by regional parliaments and that the candidate can be presented only by the president of Russia.\nOn March 25, 2005 Shaymiyev was re-elected for his fourth term by the State Council. This election was held after changes in electoral law and does not contradict the Constitutions of Tatarstan and Russia.\n\n\n=== Political status ===\n\nThe Republic of Tatarstan is a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Most of the Russian federal subjects are tied with the Russian federal government by the uniform Federal Treaty, but relations between the government of Tatarstan and the Russian federal government are more complex and are precisely defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan.  The following passage from the Constitution defines the republic's status without contradicting the Constitution of the Russian Federation:\n\"The Republic of Tatarstan is a democratic constitutional State associated with the Russian Federation by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Powers between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan, and a subject of the Russian Federation. The sovereignty of the Republic of Tatarstan shall consist in full possession of the State authority (legislative, executive and judicial) beyond the competence of the Russian Federation and powers of the Russian Federation in the sphere of shared competence of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan and shall be an inalienable qualitative status of the Republic of Tatarstan.\"\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTatarstan is one of the most economically developed regions of Russia.

The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme aims to create spaces for meeting or recreation. The programme covers a wide spectrum of projects, including streets, squares, parks, river banks, pavilions, and sports facilities.Since 2016 (and continuing until 2022), the Architecturny Desant Architectural Bureau in Kazan is improving public spaces in each of Tatarstan's 45 municipal districts, from large cities to small villages. As of April 2019, the project had revamped 328 public spaces. By creating and rehabilitating public spaces, the programme aims to be a catalyst for positive social, economic, and environmental change.One notable example is the \"Beach\" at Almetyevsk, which includes public swimming pools and a terrace. Other examples include an amphitheatre in Black Lake Park, Kazan; the Central Square in Bavly; a children's playground in Bogatye Saby village, which has a unique wooden play structure; the Cube container centre in the green beach at Gorkinsko-Ometievsky forest, Kazan; and the square on Festival Boulevard, Kazan.The programme used an innovative participatory design approach, which later became mandatory for similar projects across Russia. This approach partners specialists with local residents at every stage of the project, from development, to implementation, to the ongoing use of the space.The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme was announced as one of the six winners of the 2019 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The jury was impressed by the programme's systematic approach and involvement of residents to decide the future of each space.Each public space expresses the unique identity of that particular place, tying in its history while incorporating traditional materials. Major goals of the projects include improving the quality of life for residents and improving the environment. The Arhitekturnyi Desant team aims to provide a high quality public space, no matter the size of the settlement, including quality design, infrastructure, and materials.Spending on the public spaces projects is helping the local economy. For example, the number of street furniture manufacturers in the area increased from 12 to 75 since the programme started.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVolga Tatars\nList of Chairmen of the State Council of Tatarstan\nList of rural localities in Tatarstan\n1921\u201322 famine in Tatarstan\nList of Tatars\nMusic of Tatarstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u21162284 \u043e\u0442 14 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f 1999 \u0433. \u00ab\u041e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0445 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u00bb, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u211623-\u0417\u0420\u0422 \u043e\u0442 18 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 2013 \u0433 \u00ab\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \"\u041e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0445 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\" \u0432 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\"\u00bb. \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u0441\u043e \u0434\u043d\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f (28 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 1999 \u0433.). \u041e\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d: \"\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\", \u2116174, 28 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 1999 \u0433.

She served as regent of Kazan during the minority of her son from 1549 until 1551. \n\n\n== Life ==\nShe was the daughter of Nogay nobleman Yos\u0131f b\u00e4k and the wife of Kazan khans Can\u011f\u00e4li (1533\u201335), Safag\u00e4r\u00e4y (1536\u201349) and \u015eah\u011f\u00e4li (after 1553).

Her name is associated first of all with S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower, that Ivan the Terrible wanted to marry her, so she agreed that if he built her a tower made with seven tiers (one for each day of the week) then she would marry him. Ivan the Terrible supposedly finished the tower within the week so S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 went up to the top of the tower and  after looking out at her beautiful home of Kazan she became so overwhelmed with emotion for her people that she couldn't bear to marry the tsar and jumped off.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Kazan khans\nS\u00fcy\u00fcmbike\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park is a 4.4-acre (1.8 ha) park within Western Gateway Park in Des Moines, Iowa. It opened in 2009 with 24 sculptures, with four more acquired later. The sculpture park is administered by the Des Moines Art Center and contains works by world-renowned artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Jaume Plensa, Ai Weiwei, and Barry Flanagan. It is considered as \"one of the most significant collections of outdoor sculptures in the United States\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park is named for John Pappajohn, a local venture capitalist and his wife Mary, who gifted the initial 24 sculptures, with a valuation of about $40 million USD, to the city of Des Moines. The couple are recognized art collectors, appearing in the ARTnews list of top 200 art collectors from 1998 to 2014. The first sculptures donated for the park were originally part of the Pappajohn's private collection, and located in their yard. Before they were moved to Western Gateway Park, people used to drive by their home to look at the art.Diana Agrest and Mario Gandelsonas, two New York based architects, designed the landscape with grassy mounds and parabolic-shaped cutaways. These cutouts create walled-in spaces used to display the sculptures in groups of related artistic styles.The Pappajohn sculpture park was the capstone of the broad redevelopment project that revitalized downtown Des Moines. In the early 2000s, the west end of downtown Des Moines was in a dilapidated state, with auto repair shops, seedy businesses, and worn out and vacant buildings. The city decided to remediate the situation and created Western Gateway park from 10th to 15th street, demolishing derelict buildings and moving an historic apartment complex to another site. Development of Western Gateway and the addition of the sculpture park enhanced the real estate value and drove new investments to the area. At its inauguration in 2009, the sculpture park was an optimistic counterpoint to the Great Recession, and to the destruction across Iowa caused by floods and tornadoes the previous year.In 2011, White ghost by Yoshitomo Nara was installed in the park, after being exhibited in New York, as public art placed near the entrances to the Asia Society and the Park Avenue Armory.The Des Moines Art Center was the 2017 recipient of the Art Conservation Project grant from Bank of America, given for the restoration of Keith Haring's Untitled (Three Dancing Figures, version C). The sculpture was structurally sound, but the paint coating had deteriorated from years of outdoor public display.In 2018, Pumpkin Large by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama was installed in the park. The bronze pumpkin is about 8 feet high, including a 3-foot pedestal. The surface has a pattern of recessed dots of different sizes, going all the way up to the stem. According to Jeff Fleming, director of the Des Moines Art Center, the piece is a \u201cdefinitive work by one of the most important contemporary artists working today\u201d.A version of Robert Indiana's iconic LOVE sculpture was placed in the park in 2019.\n\n\n== Sculptures ==\n\n\n=== List of artwork ===\nCurrently there are 28 sculptures in the park:\nReclining figure (1982) by Willem de Kooning\nGymnast III (1985) by William G.

The sculpture was originally exhibited in 2007, in the then newly restored Saint-Jaume bastion, in Antibes. Subsequently, the sculpture was acquired by Mary and John Pappajohn in Miami, while the city of Antibes Juan-les-Pins ordered a similar work by Plensa to be installed there permanently.The sculpture is a 6-short-ton (5.4 t), 27-foot-tall (8.2 m) crouching human shape made of a lattice of white painted steel letters. The sculpture is hollow and visitors can walk inside to look through the spaces between the letters. This work exemplifies Plensa's exploration of communication issues between individuals or cultures, as well as his interest in literature and the human body. The letters do not form meaningful words, but rather express the symbolic essence of language. In a Des Moines Register poll about 75 percent of the people surveyed chose Nomade as the piece they most connected with.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of sculpture parks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park, Des Moines Art Center",

          "Take the time and walk around. It's a very nice park to enjoy some outdoor art.",
          "Very beautiful and relaxing place to walk through. Although some art pieces are absolutely stunning others are weird and... odd (my favorite was the two pieces of metal that were stuck together). I do wish there was more art though. It's in such a gorgeous part of the city. Definitely would recommend.",
          "Amazing artwork! Loved it",
          "Great place to relax and find peace. It isn't much crowded, so you can find your space here. The sculptures here shows the artistic elegance.

          "Went to take pictures of grandson's and enjoy a fall day. Amazing art sculpture.",
          "I love it here and, gratefully, live nearby to be able to visit often. This is an easily walk-able space to be able to enjoy the works, and the entire park is filled with incredible, diverse pieces of art. It is always open to the public (no fees or admission price).",
          "Unbeatable. I've lived in much bigger cities that could not come close to having such a wonderful place to view sculptures. Des Moines is most fortunate.",
          "Nice variety of sculpture styles. Easy to get to and has a paved walkway. Not overly large. Everything could be seen in less than an hour if need be. Enjoyable place to have a relaxing walk.",

          "Loved looking at the sculptures. I read the plaque for each one and also listened to the audio tour on my phone when I got to a sculpture that I didn't understand or one that really intrigued me.  I walked through the park with 6 others \u2026",
          "It's a fine place, but it does need some work. It's got a few stuff, and most of those stuff are made of metal. There is no natural arts.",
          "Beautiful sculptures, nice walking trail, kids can play in grass, good spot to walk your dog.",
          "I am not a fan of modernist art. Meaningless shapes with random titles do not thrill or inspire, they just take up space. The park has lots of space, green hills whose best use is to practice rolling down until you puke. Even so on a sunny \u2026",
          "Hard to imagine it's free, lots of great outdoor artistic sculptures, very sizable park, free parking (on Sunday).",

          "This sculpture park is really neat and great for picnics or to just relax and read. We got food from a local restaurant and just ate as we looked at the statues. It was a fun time and I would probably do it again! It's free so it cant hurt. Although they seem to not add or switch sculptures, it really makes the city live!",
          "Very nice outdoor park with very different type sculptures. We were there when a new sculpture was being delivered. Fascinating.",
          "They have the new LOVE sculpture!",
          "Great place to walk around or sit and admire. sculptures are very diverse so there is something for everyone",

          "I'm no art critic by any means, I don't understand the whole artistic creativity behind the garden shovel other than the obvious meaning of Iowa being farmland. The alphabetical person makes no sense to me, honestly none of them do but they \u2026",

          "There is a lot of amazing talent out there. Nice to see they put some in downtown Des Moines. A must-visit.",
          "It's really pretty and well built, but it needs more things you can interact with, rather than being a quick thing to drive by. Me and my family walked by it while going to the farmers market. Better parking would be nice as well. There are also a lot of pok\u00e9stops for you Pokemon go players like me",
          "Nice place to visit at least once",
          "Gorgeous!",

          "This place is just beautiful. I came to admire it more when I saw photographs of what use to stand on the street (empty storefronts). I won't say much because there are plenty of reviews, but I wish some parents who stop having their children climb on things when guests are not suppose to touch the sculptures.",
          "Well worth the little saunter around the block! Some nice pieces. Creative, without being overly-wrought.",
          "Good place to see free art.. well worth a visit.",

          "We came visiting from out of town, coincidentally during the Des Moines Arts Festival weekend. The Sculpture Park was a highlight for my children. Although we saw many children playing on the structures, we noticed signs asking to refrain \u2026",
          "It's fine. Has a lot of similar sculptures as the Walker sculpture park in Minneapolis",
          "I enjoyed my walk thru this sculpture park!  Had quite the variety of art here. Wish I had the chance to see it at night. Many of my favorite pieces reminded me of the ones that appeared in Beetlejuice.",

          "Probably the most beautiful part of downtown Des Moines.  Despite the similarity of the names, the display of these beautiful sculptures has nothing to do with the popular national pizza chain (please read up on John Pappajohn).  While \u2026",

          "The Pappajohn Sculpture park is a unique space within downtown Des Moines. I've been here many times, it's always neat to check out the unique sculptures and statues on display here. Also a great place to have lunch and watch the world go by.",

          "A lot of beautiful art! And a nice walk!",
          "Stopped here for lunch while driving through. Pappajohn had a lot of really interesting, kid friendly sculptures. My favorite thing about this park is that you can touch the sculptures and play around on some of them -- it's not a hands off \u2026",
          "It's a nice big open area. There are signs with the artist name and name of the piece. The signs also said not to touch the artwork. Unfortunately parents were posing their children on some of the pieces, and twenty-something (adults?) were also climbing on them for photos. I think they might need some security down there.",
          "Didn't know the artist names who created those sculptures when we visited there..  but later when I was browsing about the place & artist names it was WOW.. there are sculptures by world famous artists were placed here.. we have seen some \u2026",
          "It seems you can not get up close and personal with the statues to observe them and even take photos.... I also didn't like that the plaques did not give description of the statues but you had to call a number to get an idea. That seems like a silly idea, what if you are hearing impaired?",

          "Beautiful sculpture park! Lots of cool sculptures, and it seems like there are new ones all the time. Definitely a highlight in Des Moines. The park is crowned by the new Renzo Piano Kraus Gateway center, which itself certainly belongs in the sculpture park",
          "Pretty lame when you\u2019re spending all day here on a field trip and spending a half hour looking at every sculpture in freezing weather but they\u2019re sort of cool I guess",

          "Nice park to spend some time in just hanging out, perhaps for an after lunch walk. Maybe even a barefoot walk as the grass was very lush.

          "Peaceful and fun place to picnic,  hang out with family or read a book and relax.",
          "Very nicely designed, with excellent sculpture specific lighting. Good groupings and a lot of green space.",
          "We were excited to visit and let the kids roam around in the park. The artwork was great, but it was a little uninviting with all the signs about not touching the art and video surveillance. We spent more time telling our kids not to touch \u2026",
          "Walked through at night, think it's worth a see",
          "I really appreciate the existence of this place and the quality of the work within however I'd love to see it improved, with more art pieces and gardens added to the space.",

          "I go by here everyday.  It's beautiful lively and you know that the other side isn't a bad thing",
          "I love this park and it is great for awesome photo opportunities. I spend a lot of time down here. The only thing I really dislike about the park is at night the night guard is really pushy and will not let you walk around and enjoy the awesome lighting. ",
          "I was at the Des Moines Public Library (Central)",
          "Great park to walk thru and enjoy these amazing sculptures!!",
          "Lovely downtown sculpture park.  Close to some great restaurants and the main city library.",

          "Was an amazing discovery! We lucked into an open air event with booths and entertainment. The enormity of some pieces was astonishing while some tender ordinary pieces were just lovely. We didn't come across the dog poop bombs in the grass.",

          "This is an interesting place to tour but I would not go great lengths to see it. Its about a square block in the downtown of a small city that is spread out. A nice social place for people to gather. Some sculptures were very interesting and others not so much. There is no",

          "This is a fun park with lots of neat sculptures. I liked the one with all the different colored glass that you can go inside. However, people really just go to catch lots of Pokemon. There were 4 lures in he park when I went, and the park was swarming with parents and kids",
          "We had been going down to the sculpture park for several weekends now. It is always clean and maintained.",

          "We toured the sculpture garden with friends and it was a nice venue to walk and talk but not overly impressive. It's good it is free and for that, I would recommend at least one visit.",
          "My gal was more impressed than I but we were both glad we visited. On our way out of town, we pulled over and parked on the street alongside the park. We fed the meter 20 minutes worth and that's about how long we needed to explore the works. We really appreciate philanthropic",
          "Lots of items to view. Many different mediums. Day we were there they had a wedding party there also taking pictures",
          "Fantastic place for cool photos. Wish there were a few more places to sit or to hangout on the green space.",
          "OMG. It's just wonderful. Full disclosure--back in the 1980s, I worked at the Des Moines Art Center and loved the city. But this is really a new and hoppin' place. But back to the Sculpture Park. It's a grassy set of slopes with important and beautifully sited sculptures. It is",
          "very close to downtown Des Moines. I liked seeing the new copper library and then the park. I had good Vietnamese food afterwards at A Dong",

          "The Pappajohn family had all of these sculptures in their yard and donated them to the City for the sculpture walk. It's definitely worth the walk thru the park - each sculpture is totally unique and one of a kind.",
          "We had gone to the art museum earlier that afternoon and decided to stop by the outdoor sculpture park before leaving town, and we're very glad we did!",
          "So glad our city is trying to build its culture and provide some art abd green spaces. However, the selection of art pieces is atrocious! You have black and white balls, a crazy mean looking rabbit, items that look like kidney beans, again in metal and not pretty. With as much",
          "Lots of great areas to sit and relax while the kids ran around catching Pokemon. Lots of families enjoying the park and spending time together. The kids had lots of fun and we were able to relax under a shade tree.",
          "My wife and I went there to check out the art. Our two kids (11 and 13) were there for Pokemon Go. My guess is that about 20% were there for art, 80% for Pokemon Go. Which was fine with us; it was good to see so many people at the attraction compared to the last time we were",
          "Thanks to John & Mary Pappajohn Des Moines has an A rated sculpture garden. Relaxing. Excellent variety of grade A pieces. Surrounded by nice eating establishments. Come yourself and place to be Des Moines proud with out of town guests!",

          "The park is nicely set up and it was good to stretch the legs a little and walk around to the different sculptures. There are not a lot, but it is free, and according to the sign there is an audio tour you can look up. If you miss it don't worry about it, but if you want a nice",
          "It was fun! I brought my dogs with me and took pictures with the sculptures. They have a lot of sculptures and at night it is all lit up. Parking you have to pay with meter so heads up there. Also a lot of people there playing Pokemon go! I would definitely make it a point to",
          "I'd never been to Des Moines before, so we decided to visit the sculpture park while in the area. On street parking is coin meters. Unfortunately, I didn't have any change with me. The 1st parking garage that I pulled into was also coin metered. I finally found a garage that",

          "I'm not much into the avant-garde and modernist art thing. I'm told it is a great sculpture park. There a several pieces there I just don't get, but then again, I'm not an art person. The green space is very nice. In a nice area and well maintained. It's a nice place to walk",
          "There are so many neat and different sculptures in a space that is big enough that it's not crowded, but yet small enough that you can see everything. Plenty of photo ops and very easy to get around, even for those that have difficulty walking.",
          "People seem to love this place. I've lived in Des Moines for awhile now and never understood the hype. If you like really abstract art then I guess you'd like this place but the art kinda looks like a joke to me. The things they call some of the pieces is ridiculous. The piece",
          "High quality sculptures set outdoors near the west end of downtown Des Moines. Many sculptures by recognized artists. My fave is the metal human form composed of letters of the alphabet. It speaks of our inextricable link with language & symbol. Powerful!",

          "Very nice to visit, especially since it is free! The sculptures were very interesting and thought provoking. You can spend as little or as much time as you want to. We found the park on trip advisors and also an app I have called \"Roadside Attractions\". I felt alittle silly",
          "While the Papajohn Sculpture Park is a great attraction to visit, be warned some of the sculptures are a bit questionable. There are several along Grand Avenue resembling giant spiders & larvae. Strange yet worth the visit assuming you go with low expectations. As compared to",

          "Visited the park in the daylight and then returned at night to see that several sculptures were more interesting during the evening.",
          "Neat little park. The kids enjoyed stretching their legs and running around. There was plenty of metered parking along both sides. It was $0.45 for 1 hour. There were also some restaurants right around the park you could grab food at. I don't think it's something we'd do again,",

          "This park was located in downtown and was near some other things we went to see. It is totally worth a half hour of time to walk around it and to see the cool sculptures.",
          "You can stroll through this park leisurely and read the provided guided tour booklet to truly understand the works of art and the artists' visions. Or you can let your kids run through the park and pose by their favorite sculpture. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy this",
          "It was a beautiful day to be outside and the walk through the slightly winding path of the Pappajohn Sculpture Park was a perfect setting. There is no admission and no gates that interfere with the beautiful pathways. The park hosts a collection of widely varying sculptures.",
          "Creative and interesting sculpture park just on the outskirts of the downtown core of Des Moines. It's a relatively small park that's easy to walk around, and the sculptures are curious, even enigmatic.",
          "Very unique stop! Even if you don't like abstract or other forms of art, there is something for everyone here!",
          "My husband and I went to college in Des Moines in the 90's. We have made a few trips back and this sculpture park is unique and a lovely addition to the downtown. It makes for some cool photo ops! Highly recommend a stop. It's a quick jaunt, or take a picnic and lounge!",
          "My husband & I visited here on his business trip. Beautiful garden and easy walk and informational. The sculptures and pagoda was beautiful. Right on the river and clean. Only wish that they had a translation plaque next to the stones. All and all a very nice free garden to walk",
          "I didn't like most of the sculptures, but that is dependent on personal taste. It was nice to walk around with my husband and have something to do though.",
          "The sculpture park is a great place to just sit and even greater when the festivals and food trucks arrive. The sculptures are unique and interesting. I think everyone should see them.",
          "This sculpture park is worth your time to stop. I have been here many times, and never get tired of the works of art. It is especially beautiful at night. I was happy to see an exit for the park off of 235, and the food trucks are there. It would be a great place for lunch!",
          "You have to visit the sculpture park during the day and also at night. My favorite has to be the Kaleidoscope, great place to get special pictures. You have to bring your camera. You can get so many cool pictures. I love to also go at dusk and just sit and watch the people",
          "On a nice day, this would be a fun family activity. Great opportunity to get a little art education on vacation.",
          "The artwork displayed here is predominantly attractive and interesting. It's also very wide open. Overall a should-see if you're in the city. There is an area that I didn't like as much, as it seemed to portray \"spooky\" sculptures. I'm not a personal fan of this, nor do I think",
          "Kids will enjoy these odd sculptures and have fun running around on the grass. It is a great place to have a picnic and The Central Library is also close by (but check library's opening times.) Free fun for all.",
          "After visiting the beautiful classical capitol building, we experienced a total change of perspective by walking through this sculpture park. Very well maintained and presented. We picked up a pamphlet at one end of park and enjoyed our time appreciating the art and artist",
          "Located in the heart of downtown Des Moines, you'll be amazed at these unique sculptures and beautiful park. While you are visiting you can take some really great photos of and with the sculptures and even rent a bicycle to explore more parts of this safe and vibrant city!",
          "Very varied sculpture in a park like setting. another plus is that there are several nice restaurants around the park to have lunch. One can spend more or less time examining the various works depending on your level of interest. A good place for taking photographs.",
          "Visiting this place was a unique and interesting experience in itself. The park is very well maintained and sculptures are unique. Park is open all the time and you can also have a guided tour (call based) if that interests you. It's a small park, easily accessible and right",
          "The sculptures were unique and the park setting made it fun for the entire family. Easy access to the area from downtown.",
          "Open year round. Love it that it is downtown and next to small lunch shops/food trucks. Great to grab a bite and walk around during lunch time.",
          "This is all in about a 2 block space. Nothing exciting except the sculptures are super cool. Make sure you have change for the meters as there doesn't appear to be freee public parking. The sculptures are all unique and it's just a nice little walk in the middle of downtown.",
          "It's a small collection of world class sculptures. I visited on a chilly February day with my young kids who enjoyed walking most of the park before they got bored and I had to get them back in the car before I was done.",
          "Delightful in every way. Great for children an wedding photo opportunities. Everyone should view this treasure. Don't neglect the audio tour available on your cell. Parking was abundant (and free) on this sunny April Saturday.",
          "John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park is in downtown between Grand Ave. and Locust from 13th to 15th streets. There are 27 modern sculptures. Most people like to take picture with Nomade, which was formed by painted stainless steel letters. If you are tired of walking in",
          "Well worth the walk around the garden to view the sculptures. Interesting sculptures and descriptions.",
          "Beautiful walk on a nice day. I'm happy Des Moines has kept some green space downtown and made it interesting with the art. The alphabet head is becoming a DSM icon.",
          "Be prepared to be amazed if you haven't spent time at this site. It is stunning! Not what you may expect of a Midwestern community, but you probably wouldn't find anything like it anywhere.",
          "Pick up a brochure (or not) and enjoy a wonderful 1/2 day walking around the park. The sculpture is fun and highly photogenic. I will return!",
          "I expected a bit more from this sculpture park. I visited in a cloudy day which didn't help. If you have lots of time in Des Moines then it's worth a peek. However, if your time is limited, I would skip it.",
          "While visiting downtown, we like to either drive by or walk through the sculpture park. Its full of curious statues and abstract sculptures that one should see. It is good for a stroll, if you've got a little extra time on your hands.",
          "Everyone should stop in and see the wonderful art work in this park, its a great asset to downtown Des Moines and its close to so many resteraunts. Check it out at sunset if you have time, my favorite time to go.",
          "Definitely come visit the sculpture garden during the fabulous Des Moines Art Festival in June! Unique scuptures donated by John and Mary Pappajohn give the entrance into the city a classy feel. Then stop by Centro for dinner. Across the street, be sure and visit",
          "Des Moines isn't a huge spot for tourists, everyone knows that. If if was, this would be like a mini version of New York central park. Many locals walk around during lunch and on nice weekends many families come out to enjoy the day. Even for people who aren't into art it can be",
          "Excellent afternoon for a walk around the sculpture garden. The brochure is very well done & the sculptures are all wonderful. This is an excellent space in the downtown area.",
          "This is a fun place to walk regardless of month or time of day. The sculpture garden is a great addition to the city and it's a fun place to take out-of-town guests while eating or strolling through downtown.",
          "This sculpture garden is right in the heart of the city. Interesting pieces, and plenty of place to sit, relax, and reflect, as well.",
          "WAlk among these sculptures and ponder the ideas of the sculptors. Enjoy the views of nearby buildings.",
          "One sunny day I had some time so I walked through the park and took many pictures. I enjoyed a bench to sit on and took in the whole experience. A very beautiful experience.",
          "Who doesn't enjoy looking at art especially huge and unusual art pieces . Get a little exercise as you walk around the park. It's a win win!",
          "The multi-block area has many large and wonderful sculptures. Many of which kids can climb. It's a good place for families or individuals to kill time or to become educated concerning art. It's outside vast, clean and there are a lot of eateries within a stone's throw.",
          "Some of the pieces are genuinely good, like the letter man. But some pieces are just plain garbage. Anything can be art anymore, but that doesn't mean that it is or should be. Good place to stroll on a summer day though.",
          "The Sculpture Park is a great place to walk around with friends or on a date. I live in Des Moines and I come here very often because I always find something new that I like about it. It is not super big (it takes up about a block of space), but the art is great and engaging.",
          "Literally and figuratively the art in Western Gateway Park is accessible. You can touch and interact with the art and the art is discernible. We enjoyed the sculptures and the setting. we were there in june so also enjoyed the Des Moines Art Fair.",
          "It's a very nice sculpture park. It makes for an enjoyable evening stroll. It is a well maintained park and a draw to that area. It looked to me like the area is being re-vitalized. A number of people were there enjoying the park.",
          "What a beautiful, unique entrance into the city of Des Moines. Gorgeous winter, spring, summer or fall and provides a magnificent backdrop for food and music events throughout the year.",
          "I always drive by there and never stop. Today, I stopped and slowly walk by things that have been built. It's beautiful art work. I understand puts art work at his home. That's neat. I think everyone in Des Moines or comes to our city, should go visit the art work there.",
          "Interesting sculptures scattered around this urban art park. A little chilly in winter-best visited in the summer when the grass is green. The Des Moines Art Festival is held in this area later in the summer-a wonderful outing!",
          "I have been all over North America and have not really seen a park as unique as this one. Set along to blocks it has hosted art festivals in the summer time. All the art is very large and some you can actually stand inside. It worth a trip to this location if your in the Des",
          "What a gift the Pappajohns gave to the Des Moines community! A world class sculpture garden in the heart of downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Walk, tour or wander - all are acceptable. There is a free audio tour available. The garden is a round the clock photo opportunity for amateur",
          "This sculpture park is one of my favorite places to take visitors to Des Moines. I love that our Art Center members and donors like the Pappajohns make art accessible to everyone, not just the economic elite, in our capital city.",
          "We went in Oct. on a beautiful fall day. Does Moines has put so much time, effort and money into their downtown. It is an attraction for everyone. The sculpture garden was serene, colorful and very unique. The photo ops are amazing. No touching the sculptures but...",
          "Had my daughters prom pictures here. The kaleidoscope is an amazing backdrop for any pictures. The alphabet is also a unique picture backdrop.",
          "This is a great introduction to sculpture for all ages, set in a 4.4-acre green space, with the Des Moines skyline as a backdrop. Food trucks park close by in the summer, so you can sit on a bench, eat a delicious but inexpensive lunch, and watch people and art. Afterward, walk",
          "Well worth your trip if you are even just a casual art fan. World class sculptures are located in a very nice green space. This neighborhood has been undergoing a major transformation and the results are incredible. Private/public partnership is making this an art destination",
          "This is a testament to the ongoing connection between Des Moines French legacy and it's modern metropolis. Weathering the brutal Midwest winters, stands a public art installation of contemporary sculptures of varying media. Worth the walk through year round.",
          "Really enjoyed walking the kids through the park, always good to see the new additions. Des Moines downtown is filled with wonderful art work",
          "This park is well connected to the downtown area and is a good place to visit while here in Des Moines. It is only a small stroll from any of the downtown hotels and well worth the effort. When I was here they had food trucks surrounding the park, which was an added advantage.",
          "The Pappajohn Sculpture Park is an unexpected treat with its pieces by well-regarded artists in a nicely landscaped green. It is loosely linked to other plazas and a riverside park in downtown Des Moines in a contemporary City Beautiful effort. Together they bring needed open",
          "Very interesting statues, great place to bring a book, or picnic lunch and just sit and unwind. Easy walking distance from the downtown area and hotels.",
          "This sculpture park is unique to Des Moines, Iowa. It is iconic to everyone who lives in the area and for good reason. Right in the heart of downtown this sculpture park is perfect for an afternoon stroll, a picnic or even a place to step out of the office and breathe. It is",
          "Garden is easy to access on drive by or walking . On street parking is available. Sculptures themselves are not overly interesting, and none are titled so very hard to understand artists objectives. However, concept is nice addition to downtown, even if I found the art itself",
          "Found this amazing sculpture garden in the heart of Des Moines. Excellent examples of modern sculpture. Very worth a trip downtown. A great way to spend a sunny day in Des Moines.",
          "I had read mixed reviews of this park before arriving in Des Moines -- so I wasn't sure it was worth seeing -- but I asked a local who raved about it and I'm really glad we took the time. What an interesting mix of fascinating pieces and a beautiful setting (plus it's all free",
          "Really good park with beautiful sculptures. There are cell phone tours available and also booklets at the corner of the place. Made really good pictures over there!",
          "If you're in the city and have some extra time, I would use it to walk the grounds. The time of year and condition of the property probably had something to do with our experience.",
          "After a fantastic wedding anniversary celebration at the Americana Restaurant and Lounge it was the best place to walk - quiet, serene, peaceful and an experience every visitor to the wonderful city of Des Moines should have.",
          "Located in downtown Des Moines Iowa. I went on a Tues and there was plenty of parking nearby (metered took quarters, .50 gave me about and hour) Many sculptures with name titles and artist. There are brochures in a box that tell about each piece or there is a number to call for",
          "I come from Minneapolis. We have an amazing sculpture park. I state this to let you know what I always compare these kinds of parks to. I was not impressed with the acutal sculptures. However, all art to me is interesting to explore and it was a nice day - so a nice walk around",
          "it is a park downtown , near alot of things to do and beautiful sculptures . Walk around take picture , phone tour for each piece of art.",
          "I hope that tax revenue was not spent to commission this \"art\". It is better than a big open field I suppose. I am sure some would say that I am just not \"open minded\" enough to understand random scrap metal in various shapes.",
          "What a wonderful, beautiful experience. The many attractions are unique, and the landscaping is wonderful. It's a nice place to walk and let your imagination run wild.",
          "Well laid out, large art pieces. Very clean, within walking distance of downtown hotels. Large grassy areas perfect for families with small children to play.",
          "A great walk with anyone to see these artists imagination, we typically see this at the arts festival.",
          "Nice amenity in middle of downtown but it did challenge my appreciation of art. Maybe it's the more abstract I got get. My problem, maybe not yours. Glad we walked through and considered them all.",
          "This is about 2 square grass-covered blocks containing about 20 large and very creative sculptures. It's worth the trip---doesn't take very long to see them all---a half-hour or so. But you'll need to get the interpretive brochure somewhere else such as the Des Moines Art",
          "Des Moines does so many things right, and this is a prime example. Lovely grounds and some fine sculpture. Get a brochure to fully appreciate the art.",
          "I live opposite the sculpture park (and have done for the past year). The park is a great place for a wander in the summer months, either during the week early morning (6 am) or in the evening. I'm a keen amateur photographer and love taking pictures at sunrise and sunset with",
          "Loved t! I would go at night to see the sculptures when they are lit. Jaume Plensa's piece is certainly the highlight!",
          "This is a beautiful Sculpture Park that probably gets overlooked. I have been there several times taking out of state company. It is especially beautiful at night.",
          "Yes its great that this is free to the public but frankly there is not one sculpture I like (or that anyone else I know likes for that matter) and I can only think the \"artists\" had to give the pieces away they are so awful. Otherwise, there is grass to walk or sit on which is",
          "This park is one block long and one narrow block wide. Beautiful park with metal and composite sculptures throughout the park. This is a terrific place to take the kids or to just walk around the park and looking at the sculptures. A few are pretty wild but most are",

          "The Papa John family has spent a lot of money around central Iowa and this is a Des Moines Gem. Trying to pick a day when someone isn't taking senior, family, wedding or engagement pictures is nearly impossible. The artwork/statues are beutiful and some are just very odd. It is",
          "This is a smaller sculpture park but is very nice. If you park over by the library, you can walk through all the sculpture work. Lots of fun photo opportunities available. Love the quality of the art within the park. For a smaller area this is worth a visit.",

          "This is a great park in downtown Des Moines, with inexpensive metered parking surrounding it. The sculptures are varied, and a free brochure located in stands around the park gives you the background on the park and the sculptures. It is well worth a visit, and I want to go back",
          "The art park is one of my favorite places in Des Moines to go relax, walk around and enjoy all the interesting art pieces. The location as well as the park were designed perfectly to give you the feeling that you need to return.",
          "This green space is filled with post-modern, mostly non-figurative sculpture. While most of the art is not compelling, there is something serene about this space. Moreover, it's flanked by many of the best restaurants in downtown, and parking is not too hard to get. Consider a",
          "We went to Pappajohn sculture park but it was very dissapointing,with only a couple of decent sculptures to view the rest was rubbish. The steel horses and the alphabet body are the main attraction the rest are a waste of time,it was free and ok to walk around but go out of your",

          "A very unique park in the city. We visited the park on a weekday morning and parking was easy to find. Our family loved the leisurely walk around the park looking at the sculptures. There was a couple of food trucks and restaurants nearby if you were looking for a bite to",
          "This is a great example of public art and the cooperation of philanthropy, corporate sponsors and the city. You'll really enjoy your visit here in the morning or late-evening. Grab a meal from a nearby restaurant, eat at one of the many benches or bring a blanket and relax on",

          "The most beautiful downtown experience. I went out to dinner and after took a stroll through the park. It was such a breath of fresh air to see something so beautiful in a downtown area. I could have lingered around for hours taking it all in. This is a must do while I'm Des",
          "Very unique place to see. Good area to walk around. It's a must do especially if you are not from the area. It's free.",

          "The artwork is funky and fun. A lovely thing to do before or after a lunch or dinner downtown. It is wheelchair accessible, sidewalks all around. Street parking us usually ample but you will have to feed the parking meters. If touring on foot in Des Moines, park on one of",

          "The garden itself is well laid out and there is information at the entrance. I had a lot of difficulty getting the audio tour to work properly and we couldn't visit one sculpture because of standing water. It could be maintained better and the audio tour could be better. Overall",
          "In the heart of Des Moines there is a hub of activity and so much to see and do on a Saturday morning spring to fall. First there is the Pappajohn Sculpture Park where you can stroll among large art objects and enjoy the beauty of the day. This \"Park\" is right beside the",
          "This is a great place to go when the weather is great and your looking for something free to do. It's located in the heart of downtown Des Moines and there's a lot of parking (on the weekends). Your surrounded by the library, capital, and some amazing restaurants.",

          "We had hoped to park the car and wander but did the slow crawl by as a concert had closed the park and there were no parks handy. What we saw was great and well worth the trip into Des Moines, maybe next time we will get to see them close up.",
          "This large, magnificently carpeted-with-lawn, park provides a wonderful - and surprising - setting for a well-selected collection of large-scale art works, ranging from pure abstract to whimsical to outre to humorous. Our visit was on a warm, sunny day. A 45-minute stroll let",
          "After a very boring drive crops country, it was the perfect place to stop for lunch. We had no idea there would be so many food truck choices and the sculptures were really neat to walk around in the middle of the city. What a pleasant suprise!",
          "Stroll through the block of modern art sculptures and there will likely be at least a few you like. There is an interactive map online where you can click on each sculpture for more information about each piece, the artist, what it represents, etc. It is worth it to do on at",

          "Wow, the many different pieces at this sculpture park! I went in December the last time, which made it harder to get around, thanks to the weather. I have been to this sculpture garden many times before and have always enjoyed it. Good place to take a picnic for the kids or",
          "This isn't really an attraction so much as an area you might go for a walk or to relax if you are walking about downtown Des Moines. It's an alright place, but don't expect anything breath-taking. Getting There: Parking is fairly easy to come by in this area, even just on",
          "Since I am obsessed with my Fitbit and meeting my daily goal for steps this park was on my list. I visited on a gorgeous spring day and walked from downtown. It's a really nice free attraction that would be a great place to let kids run around and burn off some energy while",

          "The park is easily found, clean and inviting. Great place for family activity or just a walk. The sculptures are interesting and mostly, big! Weather pending, good place for picnic. It can be visited in under 30mins if you're in a rush or enjoyed for couple hours. Parking is on",
          "The sculpture park is a great place to wander, people watch, and enjoy some interesting sculptures. No, of course you cannot climb on them as they are expensive pieces of art. But there is an audio guide you can download on podcast or you can use the printed guide. Here is a",
          "don't come here. It is not a fun place to bring kids. their is nothing to do expect stand in front of sculptures. You are not allowed on them. i hope never to see or come to this place ever again. Try the art center, science center, Bass pro shop and the botanical gardens.",
          "We wandered through the park and really enjoyed the unique sculptures. My only wish is that there would be more information available at each piece so we would know the name of the art and the artist."

It was originally designed around nursery rhymes and included a castle with moat, replica of Noah's Ark, petting zoo and miniature railroad.\nOver the next 16 years the city failed to make improvements to the zoo, and it was on the verge of closing until in 1981 a group of civic-minded business leaders formed the Blank Park Zoo Foundation to help save the zoo. The foundation's number-one goal was to provide financial support for capital improvements, animal acquisitions and promotional and marketing activities.\nThe foundation succeeded by forming a partnership with the City of Des Moines that resulted in a $1.8 million bond referendum, as well as an additional $1.4 million from the community. At the end of 1982 the zoo closed for some much needed renovations.On May 17, 1986 the zoo reopened, featuring geographic themed exhibits with spacious, naturally landscaped environments. In 1987 the zoo was accredited by the AZA.In 1995 the Blank Park Zoo Foundation purchased 25.3 acres (10.2 ha) of additional historic Fort Des Moines property and nine historic buildings for future growth and expansion of the zoo. It also began a capital campaign to build a new great cats exhibit and a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) indoor Discovery Center exhibit.\nOn May 1, 1999 the Tom and Jo Ghrist Great Cats exhibit opened, and on September 1, 2001, the Blank Park Zoo opened the Myron & Jackie Blank Discovery Center. On July 1, 2003 the Blank Park Zoo Foundation and City of Des Moines completed a new 28E agreement to transfer the operations and management of the zoo to the foundation. Terry Rich was hired as the zoo's first-ever chief executive officer, marking a new era in zoo history. Initial Spring Break and Holiday Safaris were introduced with much success.\nIn 2011, new signage and interactives were installed in the Great Cats kiosks, the David Kruidenier Australia Adventure opened featuring the endangered cassowary, the sea lion pool was rebuilt, and a special dinosaur exhibit was open all summer in the Zoo Plex.\nThe \"Big Dig\" event was held at Blank Park Zoo to generate excitement about expansion, with 8,000 in attendance.\nBehind the scenes a new quarantine facility was constructed to help animal management, and a new veterinarian agreement with Iowa State University was signed.\n\n\n== Major exhibits ==\nThe Blank Park Zoo contains a variety of wildlife in various exhibits.\n\n\n=== Myron and Jackie Blank Discovery Center ===\nThe Discovery Center is an entirely enclosed area visitors encounter first when entering the zoo, and contains various species of plants and animals. The Discovery Center contains separate sections to create a unique viewing experience:\n\n\n==== Meredith Alpine Exhibit ====\nVisitors can find the Meredith Alpine Exhibit at the entrance of the Discovery Center, accessible through the zoo's main visitor lobby. Here, visitors can view the zoo's pair of red pandas from an indoor enclosure with attached travel tunnel, allowing the animals additional space in an outdoor exhibit.\n\n\n==== The Cave ====\nThe Cave immediately follows the Meredith Alpine Exhibit and contains most of the zoo's nocturnal animals, alongside a few enclosed reptile exhibits including:\n\nMadagascar hissing cockroach\nEmperor Scorpion\nEgyptian fruit bat\nBoa Constrictor\nCuvier's dwarf caiman\n\n\n==== Free Range Tropical Aviary ====\nhome to tropical forest-dwelling birds such as the pink pigeon, mountain peacock-pheasant, ringed teal, silver-eared mesia, scarlet-chested parrot, pheasant pigeon, Gouldian finch, sunbittern, common emerald dove, Victoria crowned pigeon, speckled mousebird, and mountain bamboo partridge. Some enclosed exhibits are home to scarlet macaws, golden-headed lion tamarins, and toco toucans.\n\n\n==== Aquarium of the Discovery Center ====\nThe Aquarium of the Discovery Center includes aquatic environments from all around the world. A waterfall feature can be seen above the Amazon River Pool. The pool includes tropical river fish such as tambaqui (Pacu), redtail catfish, and silver arowana. The coral reef exhibit is home to species of aquatic life from coral reefs around the world including coral, sea anemone, clown triggerfish, foureye butterflyfish, clownfish, schooling bannerfish, yellow tang, and Achilles tang.\n\n\n=== Jaama Kwa: Connection to Africa ===\nOpened in spring 2013 at a cost of $4.1 million, the zoo welcomed its new expansion of the existing African Boardwalk on the east side of the park. The expansion brought multiple new species to the zoo, including a pair of Eastern Black Rhinos, giant eland, common ostrich, kori bustard, blue wildebeest, African spurred tortoise, okapi, and nyala.\nPrior to the expansion, the zoo held a smaller collection of African species, including Reticulated giraffe, Hartmann's mountain zebra, addax, African crowned crane, and guinea fowl. All still reside at the zoo on the renovated boardwalk adjacent to the newly constructed area.\nAfter coming to the zoo in 2012 based on a Species Survival Plan (SSP) recommendation, the zoo's Eastern Black Rhinos Ayana and Kiano welcomed their first calf, female Tumani in 2016. In 2019, a second rhino birth was announced from the same pair. A name contest was conducted by the public with the calf officially being named Kamara in the months following.\n\n\n=== David Kruidenier Australia Adventure ===\nCompleted in July 2011, this Australian-themed section of the zoo brings visitors into the great Australian outback, which includes an Australian-themed barn, and many animals including double-wattled cassowary, laughing kookaburra, red-necked wallaby, and common peafowl. A specially designed aviary can also be found within this exhibit, homed to the rainbow lorikeet.\n\n\n=== Kids' Kingdom ===\nIn late June 2007, the zoo, the Greater Des Moines Leadership Institute, and hundreds of volunteers from around Des Moines built the Kids' Kingdom playground. It includes 5,600 sq ft (520 m2) of slides, mazes, monkey bars, sand pits, fossil digs, and mining sluice. This area features many \"contact animals\" that visitors can feed. Animals in this area include Nigerian dwarf goats, llamas, miniature donkeys, zebu, Meishan pigs, Brahma chickens, koi fish, trumpeter swans, and dromedary camels.\n\n\n=== Tom and Jo Ghrist Big Cat Complex ===\nThe cat exhibit opened in 1999 with snow leopards, Amur tigers, and African lions. Recently, this exhibit got a facelift with new interactive displays and new viewing area rocks.\n\n\n=== Hub Harbor Pinniped Pavilion ===\nThe new seal/sea lion pool opened on March 17, 2012 after a year of reconstruction to the old pool. The exhibit now features two high-rise viewing areas, as well as an underwater viewing area for the zoo's California sea lions and harbor seals.\nNotable residents of the pavilion include Ross and Meru, two harbor seals that came to the Blank Park Zoo from British Columbia. They were rescued off the coast of Canada when they were just five days old, severely malnourished and dehydrated. The Vancouver Marine Mammal Rescue Center nursed them back to health. After examination, the center declared that they were non-releasable due to health disabilities. They found a permanent home at the zoo after the reconstruction of Hub Harbor, where they now reside.\nThe exhibit welcomed its newest resident, a young sea lion named Meatball, in spring 2020 from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in California.\n\n\n=== Miscellaneous animal exhibits ===\nIn addition to animals in the major exhibits, the zoo includes many individual exhibits that are home to animals including:\nBald Eagles\nChilean flamingo\nNorth American River Otter\nBlack-tailed prairie dogs\nAldabra giant tortoise\nRing-tailed lemurs\nMagellanic penguins\nWhite-handed gibbons\nJapanese macaque\nProboscis monkeys\nGiant anteater\n\n\n== Conservation initiatives ==\nStarting in 1997, the Blank Park Zoo Conservation Committee has raised funds for a wide variety of worldwide conservation projects. The primary projects of the committee must be international, focus on protecting animals or their natural ecosystems, and have some tie to the Blank Park Zoo. Money is collected through various means such as children's face painting, special event raffles, and coin donation buckets.\nIn 2012, the Conservation Committee participated in these projects: \n\nSpecies Survival Plan - programs set up for endangered species in captivity\nThe International Snow Leopard Trust - to protect the natural habitat of snow leopards\nGreater Prairie Chicken Project - helping restore and sustain Iowa's population of native chickens\nGiraffe Conservation Foundation - helping to promote and support giraffe conservation initiatives\nThe Great Ape Trust - aimed to rescue orangutans and bonobos in areas of deforestation and poaching\nPanamanian Golden Frogs - aimed to sponsor a program to release captive frogs into the wild\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nIn August 2019, a 12 year-old male okapi named Kidomo brought to Des Moines from the Oklahoma City Zoo was humanely euthanized after sustaining injuries in an incident with his exhibit mate, an 11 year-old nyala named Cloud. Based on initial information, Blank Park Zoo CEO Mark Vukovich stated, \"the two animals were playing together and unfortunately the okapi was injured\".\nIn April 2020, Blank Park Zoo announced the death of 3 year-old Duchess, a female Hartmann's mountain zebra, that died following an accidental high-speed run-in with a fence post. Duchess and her mate Duke had arrived at the zoo a year prior from another AZA-accredited institution.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Blank Park Zoo at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

          "Certainly not the largest zoo I have visited, but it was clean, with shady areas to keep cool and refreshments were available.",
          "Don\u2019t come in expecting a big city zoo like St. Louis or Omaha and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Several indoor and outdoor displays with a good variety of animals to see. Some of the highlights for our family were the Australian outback area where the wallabies roam freely around",
          "The Blank Park Zoo is one of my favorite zoos out there. It's a smaller zoo than most, but it's so worth admission. There's a great variety of animals, food options are fairly well priced, the staff is friendly and interactive and most importantly the animal enclosures are well",

          "This zoo isn't on par with the large ones out there BUT it's really great if your looking for a few hours of fun. The exhibits are set up nicely and there are interactive things for the kids to do along the way. About halfway through there's a nice little cafe where you can grab",
          "We stopped in early March. Was kind of a cool day, so many shows and exhibitions were closed. Would've thought the admission should've been reduced. Got to see the new lion cubs and fed the llamas and goats. Rhinos and their new enclosure were neat. Liked the tropical forest",
          "Not recomended! Too cold for kiddos! Try going during summer. More activities and more animals to see. Get the train package is cute for kids",
          "My boys and I tagged along with my husband to Des Moines earlier this month. We stopped by the zoo while my husband was at his seminar. We were among only a handful of visitors since it was a chilly, snowy Tuesday. We all enjoyed the zoo, especially the lions and cubs, and would",
          "I was told this zoo had an awesome sea lion exhibit and was not disappointed! The exhibit was very unique and gave so many opportunities to watch the sea lions swim around. It is a smaller zoo, but it gives you an up close and personal experience with the animals. Some of it was",
          "We've been attending the zoo for many years but are quite impressed with the strides they've made in upgrading the facilities. There are plenty activities for kids and a whole play area to have fun with along with a petting zoo. We always take pride in our Zoo here in Des Moines",
          "The blank park zoo isn\u2019t necessarily the largest zoo around, but they do a nice job with their facilities and they are working on some renovations. There are all of the typical zoo animals, there is a great educational outreach program, and there are parts that are open year",
          "We visited during Zoo Brew and enjoyed ourselves. It had been years since I visited the local zoo. It is not large, but it was a nice time with friends, there was also live music, and we walked around to see the animals. I would recommend to others in the future.",
          "Saturday 12-16-17 took my grandson & wet to the Zoo Christmas festival. They had several animals the kids could touch & pet like Alligators, snakes, Giant roach& Farrett. Multiple animals to pet & feed, goats, Llamas, cows & most of the animals to see like Camels, Lions, Tiger,",
          "Blank Park Zoo is a great little zoo that has come a long long way since my last review of it. They have and continue to grow and improve. We can hardly wait for the completion of the African boardwalk to the Giraffe house. My wife and I have rejoined as members and love coming",
          "We went in November, so a few animals were off exhibit already (giraffes, wallaby, ect) but there were still quite a few out! Saw all the big cats, rhino, camels, plus all the inside animals. We liked the main building where the birds just roam around uncaged. 4 stars instead of",
          "A fully accredited midsize zoo, does a great job with animal welfare. Very walkable. It has a mix of older types of animal exhibits and newer designs. The new Africa area (Eastern Black Rhinos! Addax, giraffes, and Ankoli cattle!) and Australia walk-through exhibit with the",

          "We have been here several times since we got our family membership in early July. For a small zoo, it's a winner. Membership Monday's we get free first train ride and can bring an extra person. Every time we have been here this year has been a good time. The seal show is worth",
          "The Blank Park Zoo is fun for a family outing and has many animals to see. It is a smaller Zoo, but still has a lot to offer. My kids like the petting zoo and playground area.",
          "Came here for a wedding and it was so cute! The shelter overlooked the pasture where animals were at. In between the ceremony and reception (which was all in one place) we were able to view the animals.",
          "This is a very cute zoo with a good variety of animals for the size the park is. This place is great for young kids first zoo visit before you take them to a larger zoo. The zoobrew events is where it's at if you are going to the zoo without kids. It's a 21+ event with music,",
          "Took our 5th grade nephew and 2nd grade niece for STEM night. What a fantastic event! Planning to go again next year. The zoo is very well presented and they have the most impressive lion I have seen at any zoo. WOW, he can ROAR! All of the animals appeared well cared for",
          "Came to the zoo for a family day. We like this zoo because it doesn't take all day to get thru, you can see everything in about two hours. The train ride was short, I figured out quickly why we had never been on it before. Save your money for the gift shop.",
          "Good variety of animals, most were up close for easy viewing. You can walk the route within 2 hours. We also enjoyed the sea lion training. Will definitely be back!",
          "3rd time here and still love it. Loved seeing the new additions since my last visit. Only downfall is we were here after labor day and camels were gone and you couldn't feed the giraffes",
          "First time visiting this zoo, and we weren't disappointed. Just the right size to get the full experience in a couple of hours we went on Monday and it wasn't crowded at all. Got to see all the animals up close without fighting a mob.",
          "You must make sure you see the Sea Lions in training. So wonderful, take time to feed any animals that you can and really connect with how the zoo is helping with endangered animals. The black rhinoceros baby is a precious new addition.",
          "The zoo was well maintained but very small. For $14 admission i expected more animals. They seemed to have as many farm animals as wild animals. It's still a good place to visit especially if you have kids. Just be sure to choose a good day, not a lot of places to duck into if",
          "Granted, it's no San Diego Zoo, but for a Midwestern zoo, this one is pretty decent compared to most! We saw plenty of animals and had a nice time. Definitely worth a visit of you are near Des Moines.",
          "It's places on must for anybody looking for some activities. I think it was only maybe two bucks per person donation. Just want to know brainer and can easily take up for 5 hours of your day.",
          "This zoo is just the right size for little kids! My kids are 5 and almost 2, we visit here once a year. They love it, it's not so big that it's overwhelming, it's just perfect! The only thing that would make it better is if they had elephants.",
          "This zoo had far more than what I expected and our kids (4 & 2) loved it. They have a rainforest, aquarium, safari, farm yard and more.",
          "Dsm isn't a small town...not anymore.. And it's time the zoo caught up to this. It's clean and nice enough but small and lacks any real great attractions.",
          "This appears to be a nice zoo but when we were there it was very hot (95 degrees) so animals were staying in shade and we did not get to see them very well. We enjoyed the indoor display of the fish. Kids were really enjoying it. Train ride was $2.00. Not really a great",
          "We just visited the zoo. My two grandchildren loved every minute of it. We were there around noon. The animals were very active and the kids (ages 6 & 8) were having a ball. They enjoyed riding the camel, getting their faces painted, and also riding the carousel. The lions,",
          "Good but small. great for young kids that don't like to walk around a lot. Clean and the staff was friendly",
          "I have the grandparents plus pass whhch allows my husband and I and all grandchildren and two guests. It's great on a Sunday afternoon to be able to go for a couple hours. It's enough time for the kiddos and they get to see everything. Plus ride the carousel and train.",
          "We really liked this zoo. It's small enough to do in 3-4 hours even if you partake in most of the activities. On the drive in, they have camels up by the road - cool entrance. Once in the park, for a small fee you can feed ostriches, giraffes, parakeets and farm animals. Giraffe",
          "We were here on a very busy day, just before the 4th. It was very hot, but we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We got a lot of walking in. We liked the petting zoo. Marcydiner tantrum scale of 5/5-no screaming kids, many there, but all were well behaved.",

          "I went alone to the zoo for this trip I had, but obviously it would be a fantastic place to bring the kids. To me the small is smallish, but there are quite a lot of things to do here so you can't be bored too much. A variety of animals to see, lots of areas to rest and relax",
          "For a city the size of Des Moines, this is a nice zoo. I don't necessarily think the cost of admission is worth it, but the kids do have fun here. Favorites are the goat/llama feeding. On our last visit, the fish were obviously fed prior to the zoo opening as they were not",
          "What a great place to take the family to this smaller, but wonderful zoo. Blank Park Zoo is a great place for families and kids. The staff is very helpful and friendly.",

          "As indicated in the title, this little zoo has a lot going on for it. It is quiet and you can work through the park at a relaxing pace, not having to worry about missing something. It is a nice local attraction to have. There is a lot of shade. My kids enjoy feeding the",
          "We have taken our young grandchildren twice in the last month. We enjoy it so much we bought Grandparents passes. It's just a nice size for smaller children. We can spend 2-3 hours and always see something new. It is very clean and nicely taken care of. There is a petting",
          "The Blank Park Zoo is not a must-see attraction for out of town visitors. It's not a world class zoo with an amazing variety of animals...or unbelievable settings that make you feel like you're actually in the animals' natural habitat. It is; however, an excellent zoo for",

          "This is an awesome little zoo for anyone but especially for parents with small children! Just enough to see and do to keep little ones attention but not to much as to overwhelm. The grounds are very well kept and shade is abundant, which was a Godsend when we were there on",
          "I consider myself a zoo fanatic. As soon as I hear that an area has a zoo, I'm usually at the gates at opening time, pining to learn more about exotic animals and hoping to snap a few good pictures. & let me tell you, DSM Zoo does not disappoint. It may be small, but the staff",
          "If you're a kid at heart or have kids it's awesome! We even rode the camel :) I've never ridden anything besides a horse so it was cool. They have lots of short shows with animals and a very interactive petting area with multiple types of animals.",
          "Cool place to visit. Very clean n colorful but animals dont look happy very bored n skinny we didnt get to see all animals like the pinguins, rhino, didnt see zebras or seal. you know what im pretty sure I paid full price too and didnt get full experience I will have to go back",

          "I enjoy taking the kids to the zoo but being a senior citizen we get tired easier they need more benches all around the zoo. There are some but not very close together. I think there should be some type of seating about every 50 to 75 feet. As there is a lot of senior citizens",
          "Most people go to the zoo on a sunny day. I have been to zoos in Germany, Washington DC, Chicago among the 10s of others. Expectation is always clean safe and inviting. Your always going to spend more for the food etc but remember its all going to help keep these wonderful",

          "Nice selection of animals, easy walk around, LOVE the giraffe's and the baby rhino. Good parking, loads of shade, Red panda's are adorable, nice cats, the Austraiian exibits is great. Indoor displays are very good too. Good for smallest to biggest children.",

          "It was a little gloomy when we visited, but that also meant not a lot of people, which was awesome for the grandkids. We saw everything in five hours, which was perfect. They didn't have every venue open but had brought a grill out to make burgers and dogs for lunch. We got to",
          "We have a membership and always enjoy our visits. In the summer there are always a lot of activities and action going on. We also enjoy visiting on quiet days in the winter. Not all of the animals are always out but the ones that are are more active and we usually end up",

          "Nice to see a lot of different animals. Except for the tortoise exhibit and play area, everything seems well maintained. The discovery center kinda transports you to a tropical place with all the macaws and other birds. The fishes too attracts the kids. This is a good place",

          "On Wednesdays during the summer, the park opens in the afternoon for people over 21. There is beer, wine, and music. It's a very fun activity to do as a group.",
          "Only takes 2 hours to walk through the whole zoo. Not many hills. Great for strollers.Very clean. You can pack a picnic and eat in the zoo or at the park located right after the zoo entrance. Lots of parking available. Great place to visit!",
          "We visited the zoo on \"zoo brew night\" which was kids-free with beverage vendors on site. It was great walking around the zoo without the big crowds and it was not as hot towards the evening time outside. The only downside is that the zoo is a bit small and certain parts were",
          "I have been here several times with my children and it is always a great way to spend the afternoon. The kids love seeing the animals, especially the open area with the peacocks and wallabees. Toddlers to middle school kids will probably benefit the most as teens may get bored.",
          "My kids, ages 4 and 15, LOVE this zoo. And so did I. For one thing, it is just the right size - not too big and overwhelming, not too small either. Perfect way to spend an afternoon. Also, it's not all spread out, with nothing to see in between - there's plenty to see, and",
          "The zoo has a good variety to look at and learn. It is small enough not to wear out the very young and senior citizens. Lots of rest areas and hands on areas. I just wish the rides were included in the price of admission (not making it any higher than it is now) and",
          "We have an Omaha Doorly Zoo Membership, so going to Blank, the prices are half for us, so we go once in a while. This zoo is a good, quick, local walk-through zoo, that is fun for kids, but nothing special.",
          "Its been years since I have been to the Blank Par Zoo and for a reason-it wasn't worth the time or money. We returned recently with a 2 and a half year old in tow. I was pleasently surprised, improvements made and much better. It was just the right size for a little one,",
          "Small zoo but lots to do especially for the younger children. You could easily make it through in about 2 hours which is great for the littles to sneak in time before or after nap. We love our zoo!",
          "Perfect size for families with young kids. Not a ton of animals, but a lot to do. Great overall set up. You can visualize many of the animals from different vantage points, giving you the best chance for seeing the animals even if they are not out in the middle of the",

          "Great zoo! Great size to walk around for a few hours and not be overwhelmed. The exhibits are amazing! Giraffes are super close to you and the lion exhibit too. If you go in winter months, that is fun here too because you can see the snow leapords out more enjoying the cold.I",
          "I really enjoy this little zoo. It's just the right size with small children - you aren't going to see all the most exotic animals, but there's enough variety, and they frequently add and enhance exhibits. By the time we get to the end, my almost 3-year old is just the right",
          "I love this zoo. It's large enough to have a great variety of animals to see but also small enough that you can actually see everything and not feel completely exhausted when you leave. There's also a great playground for kids that my nieces absolutely love.",
          "This is a very compact zoo with a lot of impact. Close up to animals. Medium sized zoo. Awesome fact signs around the zoo. Great for all ages. My favorite was the sea lion exhibit!",
          "It is a great little zoo to take the whole family. Big enough you get to see most everything yet small enough to take the littlest of toddlers all the way through before they start having melt downs, well some at least. Check out there website for special events. They have a",
          "We enjoyed the Blank Park Zoo. The animals seemed content here, unlike many zoos I've been to. The enclosures are clean and big. The big cats were resting, not pacing back and forth. We took the train ride and the conductor called the animals by name, and knew their ages,",
          "I know the blank park zoo gets a pretty bad rap from a lot of reviews from others that i heard when i first moved here. My wife and I got a season pass (which was totally worth it). it is very easy for us to go there, spend a couple of hours with our kid, and come back home.",
          "The blank park zoo has done a lot with this zoo. It has more variety than one would think for a zoo in a city the size of Des Moines. They have a very strong following and do a lot of fundraising. They have rhinos, tigers, lions, seals,tortoises, giraffes, and so much more. The",
          "Did not expect to be completely satisfied. Went with our daughter and were blown away from the start. The zoo is well mapped and separated to create a nice flow. There are lots of interactive points where you're not just looking at an animal in an enclosure. For example, you can",
          "I always enjoy visiting this zoo. They have different events throughout the summer that keeps you going back.",
          "I was impressed! It was larger, cleaner and more extensive than I expected. There are fun extras, like feeding giraffes, and a huge Discovery Center with walk-through habitats. It's enjoyable for all ages and well worth the $13 adult entrance fee.",
          "Blank Park Zoo is a small zoo but I found it enjoyable. There wasn't a lot of animals but the exhibits they had was good. The zoo had a lot of educational programs and information about each animal. There was plenty of food stands and restrooms. Very clean.",
          "Blank Park Zoo is the perfect size for a relaxing Saturday stroll. Our visit was about 3 hours on a 90 degree day. We purchased our tickets online and saved money (~$6 for a family of 4). We also opted for the \"total experience\" tickets for the kids. For an additional $7 per kid",
          "It it hard to give a full review, as I was there on a very hot day (90+), so several of the animals were off exhibit/taken somewhere inside; we saw no rhino, giraffes, or tigers. We did enjoy what we were able to see, but it didn't take us long to get through the zoo due to not",
          "I love the Blank Park Zoo! It is smaller than most zoos, but that's why it's so great. It is affordable with a lot of great activities for families all around the zoo. Most animals have activities to help kids learn about the different creatures at the zoo. They also have",
          "This was a smaller zoo than most we've visited with some interesting exhibits. We didn't notice a lot of staff on hand. It would be a nice zoo for younger children or older folks to visit because all the exhibits can easily be seen in a morning or afternoon visit. There was a",
          "Blank Park Zoo is a small friendly zoo. Tigers, Sea Lions and seals, Camels, Penguins, Sea Otters and More. Economical to attend. Try to go to the animal feedings and the shows such as the Sea Lion Show. Easy to do in a day. Strollers Welcome.",
          "I so much enjoyed this smaller zoo! The layout allowed for meandering about, taking time to watch animals who were close enough to see. There was a very nice rain forest exhibit and a good Australian exhibit, budgie feeding, giraffe feeding. Loved the pollinator gardens and the",

          "had a great time at the zoo, they have really made the improvments to the zoo in the last 2 or 3 years. We had a good time in the zoo the kids loved taking pictures of the animals. Kids were a little disappointed that the train ride was not longer. Is that all? Temperature",
          "Blank park zoo is definitely for children. My daughter and I took her 3 boys ages 10, 7 and 2. They received free tickets for reading hours at the library. It cost $13 ea for my daughter and I. First of all, eat before you go and drink from the water fountains. Way over priced",
          "The kids loved the giraffes and tortoises. It was a hot day and we were able to duck inside the cat houses and other inside attractions to find relief and water. Thanks to all who answered questions and made a great day!",
          "Don't get me wrong, I am very glad we have this here. It is a nice place to take the kids for an hour or so but you should know what to expect so you're not disappointed. It is very well maintained from my experiences there and they do a good job of trying to add to it. Des",
          "The zookeepers are very friendly and will take time out of their day to answer questions, which thrilled my 11 year old son when he talked to the nice lady doing a talk in front of the tiger it made his day! I was hoping for a larger variety of food choices, like those similar",

          "My husband and I went with our toddler niece and nephew. I love zoos and try to visit one in each city I visit. The experience here was a bit mediocre but exciting enough for toddlers. They could have had more exhibitions of the animals and there were a few areas closed with no",
          "I've never liked zoos. Not a fan of weaving between strollers and trying to catch a glimpse of a monkey. I hadn't been to the Blank Park Zoo since I was a student, so thought I'd give it another go. I have rarely had more fun, reader. Make sure you get the more expensive ticket",
          "The zoo is small, but has some good animals. The price is a little high for what you get in my opinion. We liked the petting zoo and feeding the goats. We liked seeing the rhino's and giraffes. The exhibits were spaced out appropriately. There is plenty of shade for the",
          "Every Wednesday night from June through August is for adults only. They have a different live band, serve beer and wine ($4) and usually have samples of craft beer or wine each week. HyVee sells food. The animals are out till 8 pm for viewing. It's a great place to socialize",
          "We visited the Blank Park Zoo on a Sunday. It was not crowded so we could easily watch all of the animals. It is a small zoo which made it enjoyable because we didn't have to rush to be able to see all of the exhibits. We had a very enjoyable time.",
          "We haven't been to the zoo in4 years . It has really changed. It has turned into a wonderful zoo, only thing you need is elephants, and some hand one . Keep up good work. Also need cashiers who can give the right change back, as I got shorted 10 bucks. Enjoy zoo",
          "Blank Park is not large but has a nice selection of animals. We walked it slowly and saw everything in about 2 hours. The highlight for me was the 90 year old tortoise. The handler was working with him and it was the cutest 500 pound creature I have ever seen.",
          "The Blank Park Zoo is a great place in DSM. Admission is reasonable and there's a lot to see. Plan on a full day of exploring. But go on a nice, sunny day. The last time were were there, it was raining and most of the animals were inside their shelters. They were",
          "Saw the sign, turned in on a humble expecting it to be closed. BUT IT WASNT!!! we lucked up and showed up on a day they were having a member event so we got in free. Its not a big zoo but i enjoyed the visit a lot. There are camels in teh parking lot that you can see before you",

          "In my opinion, the Blank Park Zoo is a perfect place to spend an afternoon! The Zoo provides something for everyone in the family. Not only does it have a wide variety of animals, some very unique, to view and enjoy, it also has a lot of side attractions and opportunities for",
          "We brought our grandchildren and kids to the zoo. We really enjoyed the visit. The zoo was clean and the animals looked well cared for. Our visit was cut short, unfortunately, because the sky decided to open up and pour and the grandkids got cold. We will have to come back",
          "Although this is a small zoo it offers a personal touch for the.kids. The rain forest exhibit has waterfalls and a \"scary bridge\" you can cross if you feel brave enogh. Several exhibits offer opportunity for the kids to feed the animals. There are camel rides, a cute carousel,",
          "Was very impressed. Very kid friendly. Everything was set up nicely. Animals were out and looked happy. All the staff we encountered were helpful and nice. Had a small computer glitch in the gift shop but was taken care of very professionally. Would highly recommend. Great hand",
          "More fun for the smaller child not great big but big enough for small children . I enjoy the train ride and the rain forest.",

          "The kids loved this Zoo, with plenty of exhibits to justify the asking price. The staff were lovely and the animals seemed very happy and in good health. The restaurant/cafe was very nice but limited seating. Free wi-fi all over the zoo, so I was able to keep on top of",
          "If you need to distract the kiddies for an afternoon, consider Blank Park. Admission prices seem reasonable, and you'll make it up with the free parking. Very accessible from the hotel strip near the airport. The concessions need some work; the wait at the main \"restaurant\"",
          "Great lil zoo! My daughter is almost 3 and she loves it. The train ride is nice but pretty short. But nice extras- giraffe and ostrich feelings. Also camel rides and a lot of other items geared towards young kids. Recommend the season pass if you are in the Des Moines",
          "This was my first trip and it's a neat little zoo. It's definitely worth the 2 hour drive. It's not as big and doesn't have nearly as many impressive exhibits as St. Louis, but parking was free and for $9 for an adult it was well worth it.",
          "So is it fair to compare this place to zoos in bigger cities? I am not sure. But for small children, it's perfect size. Seal/Sea Lion show is a favorite. Reasonable cost- if you are local, a membership is worth while. It does feel like it grows every year. I was surprised that",
          "Visit last weekend with my kids and wife. It is a nice zoo and perfect getaway for children. Coming all the way from Ames to experience \"Iowa Wildest Adventure\". Overall, it is a good experience and the kids really enjoy them as well as the train ride. Recommended to all.",
          "We went for a little trip to the zoo yesterday. We just decided it was a perfect morning for a stroll at the zoo. It is the perfect trip for a few hours. I think it took us 3 hours to see everything with our 15 month old. We rode on the train, and he thought that was amazing.",
          "They have put a lot of effort into improving Blank Park Zoo. Every year they have new projects and expansions going on. Eventually I would expect it to rival the Omaha zoo if it continues on this pace. There are two major new building projects going this summer. Our kids enjoy",

          "The Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines is a wonderful asset to the city of Des Moines. The park is open year round and is just the right size for the city. A great outing for a couple hours works great with young kids and old alike. The staff is super friendly and they always have",
          "Blank Park is a small zoo -- you can get through the whole thing in a couple of hours, making it nice for a quick outing. It's definitely not a destination zoo, but it is a really well-done zoo for the size. There is a newly developed Africa exhibit with different cultural",

          "Hey, it's a nice attraction for a city the size of DSM to have, but after going to the Omaha zoo I just can't get into going to Blank. It's not too pricey and doesn't take all day so it does have its positives.",
          "Real nice place to take the family. This is an older zoo so there are many large shade trees which are perfect for walking around especially on hot days. Older doesn't mean old there are many new attractions here every season. The staff is friendly and the environment is family",

          "We love this zoo! With 5 young children, it's a struggle to find things to keep them entertained (and mom & dad sane). The zoo here is the perfect size, walkable even for toddlers. They are open year round, but not all exhibits are functioning in the winter. Special events",
          "Our family visits this zoo a couple times per year. It is small compared to other regional zoos, but is the perfect zoo for families with young children. My kids (2 and 4) can't make it through a larger zoo at this age. It also has a carousel and train for a small fee, as well",
          "We had a good few hours at this zoo yesterday. It is far superior to our local zoo and we loved seeing the rhinos.",
          "its been awhile since we been there but it was a lot of fun with the kids and friends.. there was like 15 of that went and it was a blast weather was great and of course you gotta see something fun at the zoo. lets just say that the kids seen the big turtles doing it. Great",
          "I love visiting zoos in any city I visit. Blank Park Zoo was nice and clean, and my favorite part was the children's petting zoo area (my husband's least favorite due to the germs). I had no problem forking over $5 to feed baby goats, other furry animals, and the fish. Great",
          "Really nice small zoo. All of the enclosures and animals seemed well taken care off. Kids keep asking when we can go back.",
          "This isn't a bad zoo. Lots of stuff to see, especially the cool Amazon rain pool. But the Omaha Zoo and Minnesota Zoo are 3 hours or less from Des Moines and are MUUUUUUCH better. But for DSM, this is great for the kiddos.",
          "Went to the zoo's Nite Eyes Halloween event. Well managed from advance ticket purchasing, parking assistance,courteous staff to a well planned event. Lots of things to do and see at night during this Halloween fun filled evening. Lots of fun photo op opportunities, memories will",
          "I have 2 young kids so the size of the zoo is manageable to see everything in a day and not having tired cranky kids at the end. The animals were all up close to the fences pretty well so you could see them well and interact. The grounds were nice and clean and they had spots to",
          "I've done a lot to improve and expand this zoo over the years, and it has grown to be a very nice attraction in Des Moines. However, because the Omaha Zoo is roughly 2 hours from Des Moines, I think they lose a lot of business to them. Regardless, this zoo is amazing for small",
          "Went for Zoo Brew. It was ok ... but I used to live in Omaha and have visited San Diego, and Phoenix Zoo's, so to me it was very unimpressive.",
          "Made our first trip to the Blank Park Zoo to celebrate a birthday and enjoy its Halloween bash. A very nice zoo, well cared for and many more animals than I expected. I have been to Zoos all over the world and this zoo is perfect for a city this size. It seems to be designed",

          "Our twin 3 1/2 yr olds loved it. This is not St. Louis...Thank goodness. Mid sized zoo, not overwhelming, don't have to rush. Fall is perfect time to visit, no large crowds, no sweating, happy animals too! We will be back!",

          "Your basic smaller zoo. The admission seems a little high @$12. Highlights of the zoo include a nice seal exhibit, tiger, lions, a very popular with kids petting room and a African section featuring giraffes n rhinos. U will never confuse this zoo with Omaha however for a mid",
          "I had the interesting fortune to visit Iowa during a chilly, rainy August. The train wasn't running, which was something I was looking forward to, but the variety of animals for the small zoo was decent. My kids had fun, especially enjoying the seal show. I enjoyed that the zoo",
          "I absolutely do not like zoos at all and should never have stopped by. However, the keepers are very knowledgeable and do what they can to keep the animals happy. I did get to feed the giraffes though!",
          "Cute zoo! Just the right size for a toddler. Bought a whistle for my nephew at the giftshop for $5 and it doesn't work at all. Bummer. The woman who does the train ride was amazing and had great energy! Don't waste your money on the whistle! Nephew loved the choo choo!",
          "We are members so we enjoy going to the zoo. It is small so you can go through it in less than one day. Only wish they had more endangered animals like some other zoos we have visited. They also need to have activities that attracts tween and teens to the zoo.",
          "I understand this is a small zoo but it really could use some more animals. While we had a great time with our granddaughter, you could definitely not spend much more than a few hours at this week. The petting zoo was nice but only about three or four types of animals.",
          "I always love to see animals, but honestly, there just aren't that many animals at this zoo. It's fun when you have young children, but teenagers might prefer some of the bigger zoos not too far from Des Moines. They do what they can with what they have. They have great",

          "Growing up close to Omaha my review is biased. My kids loved the petting zoo part and feeding the fish. If not for the North American Otter Exhibit sponsored by a local swim team with the name \"Otters\" my kids would've wanted to leave after 1 hour. The zoo is clean and staff are",

          "Smaller than expected, but had different animals we had never seen before. It only took us two hours to walk through. There are a lot of extra things to pay for inside the park (ex: camel ride, train, feed the animals), which we thought was ridiculous considering the price for",

          "Very nice zoo, its laid out so its non-stop action. I went there for just a few hours and had a really good experience. I would recommend this to parents of small families, because of its layout there is minimal walking to see all of the animals and there was a lot of stuff",

          "My wife and I attend Zoo Brew a couple of times every year and it's quite fun! There's a fun vibe that includes affordable drinks, live music, and of course the animals! It is 21+ and only runs about 4 hours which is perfect. I would recommend it to anyone that is of age in Des",
          "I take my young kids (ages 3 and 7) to the Blank Park Zoo about four times per year...which says a lot when I live over an hour away! We enjoy this smaller zoo which allows us to see all of the exhibits without being totally exhausted by the end of the trip. They have a variety",
          "It was a pleasant trip. They had variety of animals but wish the exhibits are more spacious but then we knew that it is gonna be small and cant complain much. Kids had fun.",
          "Great Zoo! There's so much to do in Des Moines and the Zoo has to be one of the top ten places to visit! They have a lot of great animals and their Zoo keepers do an excellent job of holding keeper chats to allow the public to ask questions and get to know more about the",
          "This is a lovely little zoo with a lot to see. It is fully accessible for children and grandparents who might need a walker or wheelchair. You will see animals from several continents and will be entertained by their antics up close and personal. You can ride a camel, feed the",
          "I visit the Blank Park Zoo yearly with my grandsons. For the size of Des Moines I find it very enjoyable and my grandsons very much enjoy their visits. They love to see the lions as they interact with each other. It does seem like we do miss the feeding times of the Giraffes but",
          "The zoo has about 2 hours of viewing. We noticed alot of people leaving around noon when we showed up, figuring they were going to get lunch somewhere and come back. But no, they had already seen everything and were leaving. So after we walked around for 2 hours, we were ready",
          "Sure there are larger zoos but I was so impressed with the cleanliness of this zoo and the friendliness of the staff. You can pay a few extra dollars to feed the giraffes and that is an experience my daughter will never forget. This place is great for all ages. We also loved",
          "I have been to the zoo in different capacities. I have experienced the zoo during zoo brew which I think is definitely a fun time for the over 21 crowd. I have also experienced the zoo with my two young nephews who found the zoo exciting and wonderful. It's not a large zoo but",
          "This should be number one or number two on your itinerary!! Went with a 3 year old, 4 year old, and husband. I purchased a bundle at a pretty affordable price that included admission for one day, train ride, Mary-go- round ride, and my kids got to feed a few animals as well.",
          "This is a small, low budget zoo in a park setting. It's been a round for a while and it is showing it's age. There are lots of mature trees and shade and the walkways are clean and comfortable. However, most of the enclosures are not kept up and are out of date with modern zoo",
          "Go to Zoo Brew. I repeat GO TO ZOO BREW! It is a blast. You get to socialize, drink and be around the animals in the zoo. So much fun. The zoo is also great for families during the day without being during zoo brew.",
          "Although not as large as some zoos, it is easy to spend a day here. Able to get close to the animals and get some great photos. At some zoos, the animals are so far away that you can't even see them. Nice enclosures for the animals. Watched zoo staff feeding penguins, feeding",
          "I had a wonderful time at the Blank Park Zoo, and I would recommend this zoo to others. It was a pleasant surprise when I could feed a parakeet, ride a camel, and feed a giraffe. They have lots of animals, including some that are rare or almost extinct. Something that made me",
          "We visited here while in the area. Sea lion show was awesome, but no seating....was short though, so was ok. We spent about 4 hours here and felt it was worth the admission. It was smaller than I expected, but we were not disappointed. Be sure to find and go inside the discovery",
          "Took the family for a staycation in Des Moines. Blank park zoo was our first destination. Nice zoo close to home!!",
          "My husband and I took our 16 month old to Blank Park Zoo on memorial day weekend. The parking made it seem like it was going to be very very busy however, when we got inside it didn't seem busy or overly crowded. There are quite a bit of variety of animals... compared to large",
          "This is a nice zoo for its size. It is especially suited for families with young children as there is a lot for them to experience and see. It is a nice way to spend a few hours.",
          "not quite henry doorly but still pretty darn good. nice layout and neat attractions. loved the giraffes and sea rays",
          "We love our zoo. It just keeps growing and improving. We are zoo members and go regularly year round. There are many benefits to membership as you get to know the animals and zookeepers, get invitations to special events and discounts.",
          "Good zoo for the size of the town, not crowded, lots of things for the kids to do, lots of animals, and fun for adults.",
          "I found some interesting animals that I had not seen at other zoos. As you enter the zoo you get to walk through enclosed area but have the birds under your feet. Then you walk out to some other animals that are out and about. Its not that big but I feel it was just the right",
          "I wasn't impressed with the zoo. It was ok for a small zoo but I grew up going to the Columbus Zoo (Ohio) so I was expecting more.",
          "Living in Des Moines with small children I have been to the zoo many times. It's a decent zoo to kill a few hours or so but nothing compared to say Omaha Zoo. The food is very overpriced and the \"food court\" is crowded and complete chaos. You also have to defend your food from",
          "Love this Zoo, great lay out, interesting animals and activities. They have fun extra events on Halloween, Easter and other holidays. Not the largest zoo, but definitely a lot of fun for families. They have a playground and petting zoo for young children. There are a lot of",
          "This zoo may seem small to seasoned zoo trekkers, but this zoo is a great value and visit for any family who wants to see a bulk of what is great in zoos. This zoo has great paths that equate out to a fluid way of getting around easily. There exists a large area where one can",
          "Love this little zoo. New updates are nice. Only about a half day experience. Kids love it. Animals given plenty of space. A Must do if you love animals and are visiting Des Moines",
          "We love this small zoo for our 4 small grandchildren. It take 2-3 hours to stroll through the zoo. Just right for the little ones. Don't miss the camel ride, there is approx a $5 charge for this, well worth the money. Also check the web site for giraffe feeding times.",
          "It's not the largest zoo, but they really have a comprehensive display of animals and birds. The animals seem to be well tended and cages are clean. Perfect for families, dates, and singles. Price is inexpensive.",
          "The Dsm zoo is small but it packs a punch with the many animals you can see. Perfect little outing for something to do in the morning with young ones.",
          "As most zoos go this is like most others except for some of their activities. In the summer they have a night time experience for children called night eyes. It is like a sleep over. During the summer they also have wine night where they have music entertainment, beer and",

          "Blank Park Zoo is not very big, but it packs a lot of animal excitement into a little space! I have been here several times and will continue to go back. I love the giraffe's here!",
          "I love our little zoo. It isn't huge, but the animals and features that are there are well-maintained. You can see most everything in an hour or two. The train is a kid favorite!",
          "I realize the real estate they have to work with and the climate here in DM probably doesn't lend itself to too wide of a variety of animals but we need more monkeys, some hippos, elephants... We just need more!! :) Keep the people here in town - not driving to Omaha.",
          "The weather was beautiful, so we paid a visit to Blank Park Zoo. We've been here several times before, so it wasn't a surprise that there weren't many animals. However, I was surprised that there were so many animals without indoor viewing areas. They were cleaning the seal",
          "Not enough variety of animals. Kids kept asking about elephants, bears, gorillas, and snakes. Other than that the park is a good size and have more than just seeing animals things to see and do.",
          "Blank Park Zoo was a great little zoo. Not as big as some other zoos but it did have some cool exhibits and animals I haven't seen anywhere else. Was a really good value and they had extra activities you could pay a couple bucks to do. My son really enjoyed feeding a giraffe!",

          "We love the Blank Park Zoo. We purchased a family membership to use with our grandkids and two other adults and it has been a great option. We bring the kids, visiting friends...you name it. It's an easy zoo to stroll around and everyone finds something that catches their",

          "We love going to the Blank Park Zoo. It's small enough to walk through it in just over an hour, but there's enough to see that you could easily spend a couple of hours. We love seeing the animals up close. You're with the wallabies in the Australian section and the birds in the",
          "We were there with our family nearing the end of the summer season. They have made many good changes since the first children's zoo. Not many animals were out and about that day due to previous rainy days. The umbrellas in the food court were filthy and needed to be either taken",
          "My great grandson, Henry, had his first Night Eyes this year. I was with him, his Mom and Dad and although he is 9 months old, he did have a good time. He was Curious George, Dad was the man in the yellow hat and Mom was the Professor. Many wonderful, positive comments",
          "We took our 16 month old to Blank Park Zoo and she loved it! It's not very big, but still has plenty to offer. If you're lingering at each exhibit a bit, it should take about 2-3 hours. You could get through it in a little over an hour if you didn't linger and just strolled",
          "This is a great zoo. We love seeing the animals up close, especially the lions and giraffes. The camels and penguins are pretty cool too. It's a really nice way to spend time.",
          "My husband and I celebrated our anniversary by visiting the zoo. It was lively. It is a small zoo and so it isn't difficult to see all of the animals. There are no Pachyderms or large Primates or Canines (Wolves or Fox, etc), or bear; but it doesn't detract from being at the",
          "It was nice but it rained like 3 different times and quit while we were there. We made the best of it for the grandkids",

          "Nice little zoo for a quick day trip. Has a nice train and isn't so beg that it takes a whole day to walk it.",
          "This is the best little zoo if you have young kids, we went with our nephews family. The two small children have been here several times and they know it by heart but still love to come. They have a train ride, carousel ride and a petting area in the zoo. Another great thing is",
          "I know this zoo is Des Moines, Iowa, but I can't help compare it to the St. Louis Zoo, which is really big and free. We paid $11 each to get in and walked around for about an hour and a half and said \"well, that must be it.\" and left. It was fun to feed a giraffe and they have a",
          "This zoo is just the perfect size for children --especially young children to visit. Other zoos are larger, but 2-3 hours here is just great. Camel rides, train ride, carousel ride, giraffe and goat feeding, and face painting make the day fun. Most of the paths are shaded, so",
          "We live locally and visit the zoo often. It is always clean, well maintained and the animals seem happy! My favorites are the majestic giraffes. You are allowed an up close look with opportunity to feed them as well. Always a pleasure to visit Blank Park Zoo!",
          "This is a small zoo, but that adds to its charm for us. We are able to enjoy the zoo and not feel spent halfway through. There a wide range of animals to see and the facilities are kept very clean. The staff is very helpful and everything is reasonably priced. This is great",
          "We were on our way back to Chicago from Omaha and thought what a great side trip. It was. It's a quaint zoo. Didn't realize it was a bit out of the way but it was ok. Kiss had fun feeding the fish, ostriches, And giraffes. It only took less then two hours to get through it",
          "The Blank Park Zoo is not a huge zoo, but they really make the most of what they have. The exhibits are all very well done, with educational displays that are attractive. Not a huge number of animals, but able to get really close to the ones they have. Several options to",
          "While not a very large zoo, there are plenty of attractions for a day trip with the kids (or no kids!). Lots of shade throughout the zoo if its hot. You can feed ostriches, giraffes, fish/ducks, parakeets, and goats. Of course, there is a fee to these. I didn't like that there",
          "I had time to kill while I was in town and really enjoyed the zoo in Des Moines. I wish it was a little bigger but it seems like it will be expanding in the future!",
          "disclaimer: We are from Omaha, and regularly attend Henry Doorly which has #1 zoo ranking (nationally & worldwide) from many organizations. So our expectations are high. The Blank Park Zoo had some animal on display not a seen at all zoos. It was clean, had nice walking paths",

          "My family is from Des Moines, so we end up visiting the Blank Park Zoo about once a year. It's definitely good for our younger kids, but I think older children and adults may not find it as interesting as many other midwestern zoos. Admission costs are a little higher than",

          "Can fed giraffes, ostrich, Koi fish, goats, donkeys, parakeets. Sea lion show. Area for kids to play. Lots of hands on for kids. Crafts. Train ride. Carousel ride. Make sure to get the total experience for kids. We spent 5 hours in zoo.",
          "It's a wonderful little zoo. It was well laid out. Lots of close up animals. Parking was convenient. We could have gone through in an hour, but we enjoyed lingering.",
          "We visited the zoo this past weekend and had an enjoyable time. It isn't the largest zoo I have ever been to but the displays are well laid out and overall the zoo is well planned. It was easily walkable and I don't feel like there was something I missed. We were able to have",
          "Yes it is a small zoo but I had a great time walking around and seeing the animals. This zoo has more than one animal in most exhibits overall. That was unique and I liked seeing it. Zoo appears to be newly renovated with more being planned. I loved walking into the Australian",
          "We were in Des Moines for a week & my kids love the zoo, so we went. We got 1/2 off admission since we are members of the Detroit Zoo. So it ended up being $3/each for my kids & $5 for me. When we got there we had planned to eat lunch later after we had seen a few animals.",
          "I though I had been to small zoos before (Peoria, IL zoo, Niabi Zoo in Moline, IL) but this is the smallest. On the plus side, I think both my 1 year old and 3 year old could get around the whole thing without a stroller. I took my stroller the first time and it ended up being a",
          "My 3 year-old daughter already wants to go back, my parents joined us and were very impressed. They haven't been to the zoo in decades. Pack a picnic lunch if you want to save money; there are lots of picnic tables and even a playground outside the entrance. Zoo members",
          "We typically go to this zoo every summer and in the fall for trick-or-treating due to our close proximity and my daughter's age. The sea lions are never out when we go, the koi and goats are fun to feed, but typically swarming with kids. The giraffes are my daughter's favorite",
          "What a fun place to spend a little time! We were there for a few hours with an 8 year old who loved it. We visited on a Friday and parking was no problem. They recognized our membership to an out of state zoo and gave us free admission. It's just the right size for 2-4",
          "We were happy and impressed with our trip to Blank Park Zoo. It's a small zoo that doesn't house as many animals as a larger city zoo, but it makes up for it by providing unique experiences. For example, the wallaby joeys were out when we were there, and they weren't separated",
          "For a small zoo Blank Park is very impressive. The variety of animals and the high quality of their enclosures were better than I expected. I attended on a nice sunny Sunday and spent 3 or 4 hours taking pictures and enjoying the animals. Well worth the eleven dollar entry fee.",
          "This zoo is smaller than many large cities but makes up for it in displays. If you have young children they will enjoy it. Feeding the giraffes should be on your things to do list for them. Parking may get a little hard on the weekends but it is well worth a few hours visit.",

          "It's a zoo, you'd be better off going to Omaha zoo as far as the 'attractions.' Blank Park zoo is pretty tiny, but the Zoo Brew is definitely fun.",
          "Exceeded my expectations and is great fun for the family! The feeding activities are my daughters favorite part and the new updates are great!",
          "This zoo is very small and is a nice place for small children. It doesn't take very long to get through the whole thing. I would get a map when you first come in so that you can see when they offer feeding the giraffes and other animals.",
          "Wonderful zoo! They've added so much since our last visit. The zoo is just the right size to enjoy! Without small children, we were able to see everything in a couple of hours. We ate lunch, then watched the sea lion demonstration which was wonderful.",
          "We went to zoo haven't been there for awhile, and it really changed. It was totally awesome. A lot of updates and more to come.we all enjoyed this zoo will go again this summer!!",
          "The new renovations and new additions to the zoo are just great! This is a wonderful place to spend the day with grandchildren.",
          "We have a membership. This is our go-to place for an afternoon outing. Yes, it is small. It can easily be tackled in 2 hours or less, but...it is great for kids, easy to navigate, has a great koi pond, a playground that kids love, petting zoo, giraffes, a little mini",

          "We spent 3 hours here this afternoon and it is one of my favorite zoos, though this was my first visit. I have been to San Diego and Brookfield, IL, and they are much larger, but the animal exhibits here are outstanding. Suggestion, when you buy tickets, ask when the seal and",
          "Close to the Des Moines Airport; good place to spend time with family (young kids or teens, with the grannies), with friends (teens, young adults). Learn about animals isn't why I went, but of course kids will learn a lot when they come here. Strolling along their paths, seeing",
          "This zoo is was wonderful for my children (ages 1 and 7). The entrance is amazing and the red panda was one of our favorites. The zoo is currently expanding and adding some animals from Africa. They currently have the Rhinos in place but will be adding more. I highly recommend",
          "We had a great visit to the zoo yesterday. It was a nice 75 degree day with lots of sun! The zoo is set outside of the city and is about 8 miles from I-235, so it is not right off the main interstate. After fining the zoo wee were welcomed by a great staff and a plethora of",
          "Small and very well done. Animals in excellent shape and displays/enclosures were nice. A bit expensive but we enjoyed it. Maybe that is why it was so nice.",
          "We went as a family during the summer and were amazed. I hadn't been there in years and they have made some incredible changes. It isn't a huge zoo but there is plenty to do and see. The kids enjoyed riding the camels and obviously seeing the animals. Definitely wiser to go",
          "Good size, good collection, and good landscaping make for a good zoo. We visited Blank Park Zoo on an unusually hot, sunny spring day. The zoo is a nice manageable size, you can view everything with very little back tracking. The red pandas, just inside the zoo, were active and",
          "We really enjoyed how free and open the zoo was with the animals. Loved that you could touch the kangaroos and those big birdie things too. We had a blast!",
          "This zoo is smaller than your large cities but, the price is reasonable and there are lots of animals to enjoy and pet. (some of them.) It is a nice place to spend a day with your family.",
          "This is the smallest zoo I have ever been to! Toured entire zoo in 2 hours! Had very few African animals. Not much variety at all. Best part was kangaroo exibit.",
          "Went because family had a pass that allowed us to get in free. Good for this kids I guess, maybe especially if you have a pass, train is free on Mondays, I believe. I thought it rather small, just ok in terms of animals and exhibits. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Lincoln Park Zoo",
          "We decided to stop by this zoo while waiting for our flight back home since it was only a $6 cab ride from the airport. Although it wasn't a very big zoo we still enjoyed it. They had a balance of indoor and outdoor exhibits for us to enjoy since many of the outdoor animals were",

          "We stopped by thinking we wouldnt see much because it is march and its chilly in iowa. The zoo does a great job of bringing animals in so you can still enjoy the zoo experiance. Everything is VERY clean and very nice set up. Nice little zoo not expensive we really enjoyed it.",
          "We love to visit new zoos and we had not been to this one since moving to the state of Iowa. I noticed a groupon for this zoo and got it. It required we use before Feb. 28th so our first visit would be a winter visit. We waited for a nice day. In fact, it was almost 50",
          "I feel that the Blank Park Zoo does a great job serving a city the size of Des Moines. Anyone going to the zoo should not expect a Omaha zoo or the St. Louis Zoo, but they have some great animals and some great exhibits! One of the best things they do is Zoo Brew, this takes",
          "We really enjoy the Blank Park Zoo. They have really upgraded the attractions and diversity of animals. We recently became members and love the discounts they offer on classes and camps for our son. We are really looking forward to the new Africa area once it is completed.",
          "Well, red pandas! BPZ give visitors a big punch for their dollar for a mid-sized zoo. The zoo isn't huge, but fills an afternoon with great animals and exhibits. More than enough to enjoy and not get bored. They also have great events throughout the year, like Zoo Brew and",
          "Had won tickets through my local TV station, and only time I would be in the area was over the weekend of the 19th and only time for me to get away from business was in the afternoon, but when I got to the zoo I was told I could not use the free tickets as a special event was",
          "Our family of three had a great morning at the zoo on a Saturday in July 2013. Our three-year-old son was awed by all of the animals, loved the train ride and feeding the fish, and enjoyed the playground too. It was worth it to stand in line for him to feed the giraffe and the",
          "We always try to visit a zoo when going to different cities/countries. We live in the UK. We found the zoo to be a friendly family like zoo. The animals seemed well looked after and some of the animals in the children's area where very friendly and came up to visitors to be",

          "My Wife and I really enjoyed our day at the Zoo. Smaller than Brookfield or Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago,IL But such a pleasant setting plenty of shade and benches. Nice indoor area to see the bird collection. The desk clerk at the Days Inn (airport) we stayed at had discount",

          "We visited the last weekend in August during a heat wave. Arrived at the zoo just after opening before it got too hot. Entrance staff were very nice and helpful. The Australian area and children's zoo employees couldn't be bothered to speak to us even though we were the only",
          "The zoo was small but great, we went to specifically see a sloth, but on arrival had found out, it had passed away prior to our visit.....Don't waste your money on the train ride, it lasts about 3 min and you don't see anything spectacular. overall it was a good trip!",
          "The Blank Park Zoo is a great zoo to visit if you have a couple hours of free time. The park is well-spaced out and the animals have fairly spacious exhibits. It is possible to get close to the animals; you are often able to walk through the habitat itself (very neat with the",
          "We took our grandchildren to the zoo. They really enjoyed it. I am not an animal fan, so it was not that thrilling for me, but they liked it. I think they do a good job there. The gift shop, and the facilities are nice. I would recommend taking the kids. Carolyn H",
          "This is our second visit to the Blank Park Zoo and this time we got to see the cool Sea Lion expansion. It seems like they are constantly trying to improve and update which I really appreciate. Again we loved feeding the birds, giraffes and riding the camels. Great experience",
          "There are better zoos out there. You just have to drive a long ways to get there, so this is good for an Iowa zoo. They had a few unique animals we hadn't seen at MN, MO, IL, CA, or WI Zoos and I really like their Australian Outback (the kids were amazed the animals could just",
          "Both of my children, ages 6 and 12 enjoyed the zoo. It took us about 2 1/2 hours to go through the zoo. You can feed some of the animals and there is a train and merry go round.",

          "This zoo is the perfect size for younger kids who don't want to spend hours walking around at the zoo. It takes 2-3 hours to walk through the zoo depending on how fast you walk. They have a variety of animals and some extras like a train ride, carosel, camel rides, bird and fish",
          "Blank Park Zoo can be done easily in one day. I like that it is easy to navigate and not so big that I feel exhausted after only half the exhibits. The animals seem happy and there are always special exhibits going on. My favorites are the monkeys, elephants and giraffes.",

          "If you compare the BP zoo to big city zoo's you'll be semi disapointed, but all on it's own it's actually not bad. They are constantly doing improvements and it's showing. They have a good selection of animals and the park is always very clean. Adding new exhibits every year",

          "Blank Park Zoo is a gem in the central Iowa area. Although it suffers the same flaws as other small-city zoos -- small enclosures, limited selection of animals and few auxiliary activities -- most families will find this to be a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. We",

          "So, let me start by saying that I ALWAYS spend about 3 times as long as anyone else at any kind of zoo, museum, etc. I read EVERYTHING, take my time observing/absorbing, people-watch. Having said that - I was completely done in 2 hours at the Blank Park Zoo. But it was fun!",
          "We were in Des Moines for a week and had nothing to do my little girl insisted on seeing the local Zoo. I have to admit I was not too enthusiastic coming from New York City and growing up with the Bronx Zoo I was skeptical about taking her to this one. Upon getting to the zoo it",
          "My husband, 23 year old daughter and myself, came here on July 1. It was a gorgeous day and even though we had been here before, we noticed the entrance was totally different than before. The admission fee was the same, which was a great thing. Everyone likes different things",

          "This is a children\u2019s zoo geared toward kids 10 and under. I have been going since it first opened and there are fewer animals (seals, monkeys) than ever. Gone are the zebras and the buffalo. Instead, they have added a butterfly garden with kid-friendly iron, zoo themed",

          "We had so much fun walking around the zoo and seeing the animals. Unfortunately we weren't there when it was warm enough for some of the animals to be out. It was great to be able to walk aroung and have the walabies hopping around next to you and being able to see them up",

          "While visiting my in-laws for the weekend, I went to the Blank Park Zoo with my 6-year-old daughter and my mother-in-law on a blustery Sunday in mid-October. Because some of the animals were off exhibit for weather and event preparations, we were charged the lower winter rate.",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage.

These trails are near several recreational facilities including the Pete Crivaro Park, Principal Park, the Principal Riverwalk, the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden, Union Park and its Heritage Carousel of Des Moines, Birdland Park and the Birdland Marina/Boatramp on the Des Moines River, Riverview Park, McHenry Park, and River Drive Park. Although outside of Des Moines, Jester Park has 1,834 acres (742 ha) of land along the western shore of Saylorville Lake and can be reached from the Neil Smith Trail over the Saylorville Dam.\nJust west of Gray's Lake are the 1,500 acres (607 ha) of the Des Moines Water Works Park. The Water Works Park is along the banks of the Raccoon River immediately upstream from where the Raccoon River empties into the Des Moines River. The Des Moines Water Works Facility, which obtains the city's drinking water from the Raccoon River, is entirely within the Water Works Park. A bridge in the park crosses the Raccoon River. The Water Works Park recreational trails link to downtown Des Moines by travelling past Gray's Lake and back across the Raccoon River via either along the Meredith Trail near Principal Park, or along the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. The Water Works Park trails connect westward to Valley Junction and the recreational trails of the western suburbs: Windsor Heights, Urbandale, Clive, and Waukee. Also originating from Water Works Park, the Great Western Trail is an 18-mile (29 km) journey southward from Des Moines to Martensdale through the Willow Creek Golf Course, Orilla, and Cumming. Often, the location for summer music festivals and concerts, Water Works Park was the overnight campground for thousands of bicyclists on Tuesday, July 23, 2013, during RAGBRAI XLI.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nThe Greater Des Moines Sister City Commission, with members from the City of Des Moines and the suburbs of Cumming, Norwalk, Windsor Heights, Johnston, and Ankeny, maintains sister city relationships with five world communities:\n \u2013 Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan (August 16, 1958)\n \u2013 Saint-\u00c9tienne, Loire, France (May 29, 1985)\n \u2013 Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (August 8, 1985)\n \u2013 Stavropol, Russia (July 27, 1992)\n \u2013 Pristina, Kosovo (November 29, 2018) (Kosovo also opened Consulate in downtown Des Moines in 2015) List of diplomatic missions of Kosovo\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people from Des Moines, Iowa\nMoingona\nDes Moines Police Department\nDes Moines-class cruiser\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nFriedericks, William B.

          "We were here for a small wedding.  Very nice venue.  Food was catered by the in house restaurant.  Good food.",
          "An amazing improvement from years ago. It's a fantastic facility to host events, they take great care of the grounds. There are some fantastic symbolism to the design of the facility, I highly recomend inquiring about some of it, its super cool. Inside the conservatory there are some truly beautiful plants and specimens.",

          "Beautiful place and fairly priced. Love the gift shop!",

          "Beautiful, interesting exotic plants you can wander through at leisure. Rates for children (ages 4-17) make it easier for families to go. There aren't many activities aimed at children, though. Wonderful place to visit otherwise, to relax amid colors and scents. The staff is very friendly, too.",

          "It's very nice but better to visit during late spring to early summer when the outside gardens are in bloom.",

          "Great place too visit with your family very wide variety of plants and the staff seemed very noligable my only complate would be that it didnt seem like the owners themselves where very noligable about certain plants because some that where outside should have been inside in order too grow properly",
          "Just a very beautiful place, if you love sitting in your garden or learning about plants this is the place to go!! Great place for a family outting or even by yourself, the front desk/gift shop offers alot of interesting knowledge, gifts \u2026",

          "Beautiful location but I imagine it's better in the summer when you can visit the outside gardens.",
          "These are beautiful gardens! However the price in my opinion is pretty steep, my family of six ( ones still a baby) cost $41 per visit so we usually only go once a year. I was a bit disappointed with this year's homeschooling day. It felt mostly self-led and the schedule was confusing.",
          "Came here to take some pictures, no signs posting that this wasn't okay. No one stopped us at the entrance. Employee approached us after we had been inside for 30 minuets asking if we had a photography pass, which we didnt, and stated that \u2026",
          "What's not to like about a botanical garden?!",

          "Recommend if you've never been here",
          "Extremely small, no better than your typical grandma\u2019s garden. Not worth the $8 adult admission price.  I have been to much better for the price.  I would only recommend going out of curiosity and nothing more",
          "Absolutely beautiful!  Can't wait to go back and bring the grand kids",
          "Pretty much nothing open or indoors in January. A some with a few Californian plants, and a green house for the flowers... I get more out of mays floral... not worth the 16 bucks. Your better off driving to Minneapolis to go to theirs for free.",

          "Beautiful place and very helpful and knowledge staff.",
          "Man have they got a long ways to go. Typically Des Moines in the worst way. A small political cabal runs the place dooming it to perpetual mediocrity. Tropical dome reminded me of one I visited as a child only worse! Save your money. There are better gardens in Iowa and they are worth the trip.",

          "Small compared to others that I have visited but they do house a large variety fauna and flora. Althouth dress accordinly because humid and muggy condition shoild be expected",
          "I\u2019m always impressed with their programs for kids. Nice meeting rooms. Works well for family pictures. It\u2019s a little overpriced if you\u2019re just looking around.",

          "LOTS TO SEE. INSIDE & OUT.DELICIOUS LUNCH.",

          "We went for lunch at Trellis which is in the gardens and it was very nice in a great setting. Towards the end of July was not the best time to visit the gardens but it was still nice and not too big to walk around.",
          "My family has lived in Des Moines for a few years but have never been to the Botanical Garden so we decided to give it a shot. For 3 of us it was expensive for what it was. It took us about an hour only because my daughter was doing a scavenger hunt which kept her occupied. The",

          "Quite well kept; plants were lovely and the water garden was a nice feature. My only reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is that fact that it is rather short.",
          "We have visited botanical gardens all across the country, and this one ranks up near the top. Friendly staff and clearly labelled specimens make this a great visit.",
          "We took children and grandchildren to see the many varieties of plant life. Not having visited in over 5 years I was wowed by how much more there was to see and enjoy. Especially appropriate for my grandchildren.",
          "I especially love the outdoor paths and waterfalls/ponds-very relaxing! It was fun to go with my daughter as she looked for items on the scavenger hunt that she was given at the admissions desk. Things are marked well, and the arrangements make maximum use of the space inside",
          "My husband and daughters visited the Des Moines Botanical Gardens in late April. The building is a geometric sphere and every inch is home to a unique and gorgeous plant or flower. The gift shop was fun and reasonably priced and we all walked away with a few 'treasures'.",

          "We love coming here. There's such a sense of peace. It flanks the river and has a large conservatory onsite. The variety of flora is a bit different than what we have in our home state of Florida so it's always neat to learn about new places and how the plants differ. I would",
          "I was stunned at my first visit to the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden. They grow an amazing variety of tropical and subtropical plants - including large trees! - under the geodome in Zone 5 Iowa! The Botanical Garden is a lovely place to spend a long, leisurely afternoon,",

          "This garden is right downtown. It is a little hard to get to with all the construction nearby but is worth the effort. Take a couple hours and visit, you will be better off for the time invested!",

          "Had a nice visit to Botanical Center. It is reasonably priced and a great place to spend a summer day. The flowers, plants and the waterfall are very nicely done. The only negative was the restaurant. I expected it to be pricey but it didn't have anything we wanted on the menu",
          "We visited the gardens last fall. Many of the flowers were past their bloom, but there were many plants to enjoy. The summer will be very nice (haven't had the time in town to go again). The staff were very helpful and there are several different areas to walk around and view.",
          "We visited while in town for some much needed relaxation. The gardens are a bit on the small side overall, but reasonable for the price. They featured a corpse flower, which is a rare site all on its own. The staff was helpful and friendly, however the map wasn't very detailed",
          "The combination of the Botanical Gardens and the walking path along the river was really a delightful experience.",
          "Smaller botanical garden, but a good variety and a nice stop during the long day of driving. Very helpful and friendly staff",

          "Blown away by how awesome this is. Much larger than I expected. Especially liked the outside garden with a large variety of plantings. New area had plantings of native Prairie species. Certainly not in my future, but my wife and I both thought it would be a fabulous setting",
          "Always something different in bloom. New exhibits and displays all the time so not every visit is the same. Also, something new to learn on each visit. Lovely place to relax, take a stroll and just admire the beauty.",
          "I wasn't totally impressed nor was I unimpressed. Maybe had I gone at a different time of the year there would have been more flowers to my liking. I did Love the Dome and wandering around the inside. The facilities maintained well. Apparently they have things for kids",
          "Although these gardens are not large, definitely worth visiting. Beautiful with friendly staff and volunteers who love plants and gardening. Special bonus: the room off the tropical dome that houses plants with names and with different lighting. Wanted to stay there all day it",

          "The Botanical Center is small, but beautiful. The outside gardens are breathtaking this first of June day. A volunteer came up and ask if we had any questions. We took pictures inside and out and not once did anyone say we couldn't. My only objection is that I like to know",

          "Went here with my boyfriend a few weekends ago, and we loved it!! Such a coastal/tropical feel and so many beautiful plants (we both LOVE plants)!! A great way to spend part of the day because of the long walk (and its very relaxing). Would be a great place to take kids as well.",
          "We have been several times to the Botanical Center over the past ten years and have even had annual memberships for some years. The facility is small but very well kept. The flora variety is interesting but not terribly unique. Years ago there were birds, turtles and koi but",

          "This is a small botanic garden and I wouldn't say there was anything wrong with it, however, it was just ok. It was a bit tricky to get to and we visited on a chilly early spring day. There was lots of greenery but not too many flowering plants. All of the visitors seemed to",

          "Well maintained indoor arboretum which houses a lot of tropical plants. The mini waterfall is an additional attraction. Also offers a nice view of the city when you decide to take the flight of stairs located inside. This is definitely a green place when compared to the dry",
          "It was a great break on a cold day. It's a little pricey for less than an hour experiance and I'm sure it is better in the warmer months to visit the outside gardens",

          "The garden is best in warm weather when you can roam all the grounds, including walking under a waterfall. Wonderful seasonal plantings and lots of water elements, including a view of the river. The inside is excellent, but you go through it fast. Still, there's something for",
          "The botanical garden just completed a several year total remodel. It is now the perfect place for a corporate school or a wedding reception or a large catered party. The outdoor water gardens are fabulous. There are wooden platforms out over the water where you can seat",

          "Please keep in mind, this is the first review I have ever written, but my experience here was so bad, I've been inclined to write a negative review. First of all, the cost of admission was the same (or more in the case for STL city/county residents) as Missouri Botanical",
          "This is definitely a stop you should make while in Iowa's capital. Whether your interest is bonsai, cactus, or tropical plants there are exhibits ready to attract your attention. We have visited dozens of times, but the center has never missed having new sights. My favorite",
          "It's fall so the grounds probably were not as gorgeous as they are in spring and summer, but we really enjoyed all the indoor displays and especially the greenhouses. Definitely worth the price of the ticket to get in!",

          "This botanical garden is just lovely. They boast the largest selection of coleus in the area. They certainly have many varieties and as a collector of such I had a difficult time not pinching a few plants!! There is a wonderful walkway over the water way which is 'planted' with",
          "What a sweet surprise. In Des Moines for work and wanted to go for a walk so myself and a friend decided to visit the Botanical Gardens. Was afraid the frost would have ruined much but it was beautiful. Wish we would have gotten their earlier and had lunch on their terrace.",

          "Our group was passing through Des Moines and stopped here for an hour. This was a very nicely maintained botanical garden. There were many sections to see and one hour was simply not enough time for anyone who enjoys gardens. We will definitely visit again if we are in the",
          "From what my wife and I were told, this garden is fairly new. It was a wonderful place to spend about 1 1/2 to 2 hours on a Sunday afternoon. Nice displays both indoor handout. In the dead of winter it would probably not be worth visiting given the small indoor display area,",

          "If you're really into plants then you'd really like this. It's a good place to go in the winter because it's warm and you can see some green again. I imagine in the summer you'd be able to find some more interesting things to do around Des Moines.",

          "The botanical garden has a great variety of plants, from a prairie collection to tropicals kept in a domed area. If you grow coleus, just the number of different varieties on display is worth a visit. They also have a few bonsai. We did not eat in the cafe, but they appeared",
          "What a great treat! This is the first place our group visited on our Gardens of Des Moines tour. The garden was outstanding. They were having a spring celebration with plants for sale and also a book sale too. Trellis Caf\u00e9 had a good lunch. Loved their display of flowers. Staff",
          "Gorgeous, smaller Botanical Garden and Conservatory. Beautiful architecture and structures. Being a Horticulturist I spent about an hour walking around. I'd suggest walking the bike path, too and going across the bridge to the cute fishing pole swing set. Very well done garden",

          "Recent re-modeling, re-planting, and I assume, re-thinking of the guest experience have made this re-newed and worth another visit. Especially in the colder weather months, this somewhat forgotten attraction is a good place to re-gain the quiet and peacefulness often missing in",

          "The DSM Botanical Garden breaks the laws of physics. There's sooo much in such a relatively small dome! The variety and care of the plants is impressive, and the huge assortment of activities for children and adults is as well. Bring the kids an chill for an hour or so. Also",

          "After reading such poor reviews I wondered if the garden was worth the trip. Don't believe all you read. The parking area is landscaped with many flowering plants and grasses. There are seven acres of well planned gardens outside the geodesic dome. The grounds include a water",
          "Brought my family here for a weekend activity. It took us about 10 minutes to see everything which was definitely not worth the price they were charging. Plants were not labeled well, so we had a hard time figuring out what things were. They had a nice fountain to look at,",
          "The music was so loud that we had to go to the back side up on the second floor to get away from it. You ruined the East River Road by taking it out and putting that stupid garden in that no one go to because it is always locked. I always drove down that road from University",
          "We were very impressed with the garden, both under the dome & outdoors. While in area in the dome is very well done, the outdoors gardens are new within the last year. What a treasure! So many flowers were in bloom & I don't think we have ever seen so many different varieties",
          "This was a nice place to spend time with a friend. There was nothing out of the ordinary, however, that would bring me back regularly. Several areas were blocked off with yellow tape including the upper observatory area. Lunch outside was delightful, though.",
          "I have been here many times as I am a local of the area. It is not a huge botanical garden but they often add new exhibits and are always friendly. It is a nice place to walk around when the weather outside is less than hospitable. In the spring/summer months the outdoor garden",

          "For being less than $10 per person, there sure was a lot of 'bang for my buck' going on. The inner dome that is seen from outside is even better on the inside, and is well 'furnished' with plants of all varieties. The outside architecture of the little restaurant and the pond",

          "If you visit the GDMBG and don't leave the dome, you could be forgiven for thinking that the conservatory was not worth the admission price. However, the extra attractions, such as the Gardener's Showhouse and the beautiful outdoor gardens add value to the gardens. Plan a",

          "The botanical is excellent, not only can you find a wide variety of plants and explanations on their properties, but sometimes they also have artistic gardening exhibitions. The gift shop has many educational toys. It is volunteer run, and these people do a great job in many",
          "I had very high expectations as I grew up in Milwaukee which has 3 domes so I was slightly disappointed by the size when we walked up. However, inside is beautiful and relaxing. The only drawback to the day was they had a rather bad band playing. They have a waterfall, a stream",
          "We visited in February... not much to see in the gardens outside but the gardens inside the dome made us feel like we were in the tropics. Plenty of interesting plant species from all over the world.",
          "There is a really great restaurant located in the Botanical Center, and access to the dome is included when you eat here. The dome itself is a very nice, warm place to visit in the cold of winter. There is also a nice gift shop. The hardest part is finding it! It is located",
          "The Botanical Garden's dome isn't big, but it's a delightful place to visit in the winter. Great gift shop and restaurant too. Can't wait for spring when the outdoor gardens will be alive!!",
          "I enjoyed my visit yet again and always appreciate it even more in the harsh Iowa Winters. Iowa is rather flat or rolling hills all stripped of mostly all trees for farming corn. Iowa is a sea of tan and brown in the dead of winter. A trip to the botanical center is a rather",
          "It's always nice to walk among exotic trees and shrubs during the starkness of winter and pretend you are somewhere tropical. Two years ago our first date was to hear the Blues bands that entertain on Sunday afternoons in Jan and Feb. The BG website lists lots of activities",
          "The Des Moines Botanical Garden is truly the gem of the city the year round. We're blessed for not being far away from a tropical area thanks to the signature dome. I had visited the Garden twice in recent weeks, and I found something that amazed me each time, its new exotic",
          "If you haven't been to the Botanical Garden recently then I would definitely plan on visiting in the near future. I would probably wait until spring so you can walk through the new outdoor garden area. They've done so much work transforming the outdoor gardens and adding so much",
          "We have been intrigued by the geodesic dome that sits off I-235 in Des Moines, and wondered what it was. We finally stopped to find out. The dome is part of the Des Moines Botanical Garden, a small, but tastefully done garden that is in the process of growing. They have",
          "The domed conservatory was nice, but I thought it was overpriced at $5 and it is very small. They are building a large outdoor garden which should greatly improve the attraction. The wall of plants in the lobby was stunning. They had a rather bizarre exhibit were plants were",
          "Compared to other Botanical Gardens I have been to, this is very small, but compact. There was a very lovely display of art and foliage that was very photographic. There is a very large addition in the works that should be done by next year. What's not to like about flowering",
          "I was a little disappointed in this botanical garden. The inside was just OK. The outside is currently closed for major renovations. I'm sure that will be lovely once it's finished - which I believe will be spring of 2015.",
          "Right now it is a tad hard to get to since one entrance is closed to the public. Once work is done it will be worth a visit again.",
          "Located jsut next to the river, the drive towards it allows you beautiful vistas of the river, the Women Achievement Bridge, the Pagodas. Exvcellent cycling lanes towards it too.",
          "It is a great place to take away the winter blues, and enjoy a lovely lunch no matter the season. The new restaurant team has enlivened the lunchtime experience, providing delightful choices that change monthly. The atmosphere is nice now, but will be even better with the",

          "I visited the botanical garden while visiting my mom in Des Moines for Mother's day. We visited on a day when there was a plant sale in the parking lot and free admission, so I had an even better experience than I would have otherwise! The gardens themselves are interesting-",
          "We visited here on a cold winter's day when the temperature was below zero. Inside was a tropical oasis, with the temperature of eight five! It's a must do during a long Iowa winter. We also enjoy a visit any time of year. We will be back!",
          "Small but comprehensive botanical garden under a geodesic dome. Looks like they are doing extensive work outdoors, so my guess is this summer it will be larger and improved. Best surprise was the excellent restaurant in the building, with good service and really nice food.",
          "A great place to warm up on a freezing winter's day, and remember that spring will eventually come! We spent a very nice afternoon here as a family (kids 6, 8 &10). It can be covered very quickly if that's your goal, but we tried to really slow down and appreciate each area.",
          "It was a pleasure to see the beautiful flowers and amazing trees. It smelled pleasant and fresh. The indoor climate was like a summer morning. A great place to visit in February. Or anytime.",
          "The botanical center is a great place to spend a cold winter day or rainy spring day and admission is $5 per adult. There are plenty of places to sit and enjoy the plants. The botanical center is currently undergoing a major renovation and I'm excited to see the completed",

          "The botanical garden has a lot to offer. I actually met a friend there for lunch, the restaurant was good, food was yummy. Unfortunately, the flowers weren't really too great in the winter. It would be fun to go back in the spring. Carolyn H",
          "When it's freezing outside and the winter blahs have gotten to you, go to the botanical center. You will walk in and feel humidity for the first time in months and it will feel great. Love their Bonzai collection.",
          "While babysitting our 17 month old grandson we wanted to go for a walk but it rained for the 3 days. We took him to the Botanical Center to roam and he loved it. The best part are the incredible photos we were able to take of him with the gorgeous plants in the background!!",
          "This was false advertising at its best. Ads say 14 acres, it won't be that for several years. It was tiny and half the few plants they had were dead! Do not bother !",
          "It was gorgeous in there but due to the time of year we visited not much in flowers, mainly just trees. We have planned another visit soon to see all of the beautiful flowers.",
          "I have visited the botanical gardens several times over the years. We last went over winter break with the kids and I loved the remodeling they have done. It is a lovely place. They had a little scavenger hunt that helped get the kids involved and interested in checking out",
          "Plenty for the kids to do/look at. Lots of stairs, bridges, lookouts to take in all of the gorgeous plants. Nice and warm-a great break from the chilly air outside!",
          "this place is kinda small, but it kept my 1-year old entertained for sure. i enjoyed it, too, i suppose. he was free, i was $4, i think. worth it.",
          "A lot of the flowers looked very dry and it was a small garden but the kids really enjoyed it. Had some fun crafts set up for them to do.",
          "I took my 2-year old and 6-old year niece and nephew here. They enjoyed the layout of the center. The fish, trees, plants, bridges, and flowers. They hand out a scavenger hunt paper when you enter and that was fun to try to complete. Some items weren't marked but the staff was",
          "The botanical gardens were nice but it is very very small. For $5 each it wasnt worth it, but it was nice.",
          "One of the things that I like best about the Botanical Center are the birds, fish, turtles, lizards, and other creatures that roam free inside the dome. It's like a rain forest with real sounds of the waterfall, frogs, birds, etc. The gift shop has unique items including",
          "We attended a wedding at the gardens. The roof was leaking very much and the whole building was very tired looking and is bad need of updating. They need to add more plants and remove or trim up many dead ones. For $10.00 you don't get much value. I'm sure they are operating on",

          "Try to get to the Botanical Center at least 1 x a season for the different displays. Great way to spend a couple hours while in Des Moines",
          "Was a little disappointed. Thought there would be more to the garden. If it was another time a year it may have been better. Did like the show room that was done by volunteers, gave me lots of ideas for my own garden.",
          "Took the family here while on a mini vacation to Des moines. The verity of plants and trees was fantastic for the size of the gardens. I went for my wife and ended up having a wounderfull time. Its a bargen for sure and must see for the entire family.",
          "From plants of all kinds to koi fish swimming under bridges, this dome hides some great stuff. There is a banzai garden, lots of birds and some gorgeous orchids. It is super inexpensive and really beautiful.",
          "We were told they are expanding the outside spaces to include more gardens. Neat building here (small) by the river and will be nicer when you have more outside exhibits to stroll through.",
          "On a rainy, summer Saturday we visited the Botanical Center and were treated to not only the lush exhibits in the dome but also to at least 8 wedding parties who arrived for photos! It was very relaxing and you can go at your own pace. Above the main floor there is a balcony",
          "We enjoyed the Botanical Center and loved looking at the vast variety of plants. Our daughter's favorite part was the turtles. Pick up a scavenger hunt worksheet even if you don't have kids in your group; it helped me find plants I hadn't noticed the first time around. We went",
          "We went here 2 years ago and had to return. We got a coupon from the visitor's bureau, which made it really affordable. Our family ranged from 10 months to over 60. There's so much to look at and explore. There's a nice kids area with coloring and activity sheets, which the",

          "Des Moines Botanical Center is small and lacks of diversity of plants, trees, and flowers. We were very disappointed at the exhibits at the center. More importantly, the center doesn't even have that many exhibits. The orchid garden is poor and very disappointing. The bonsai",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) quite often. Snowfall averages 35.3 inches (90 cm) per season, and annual precipitation averages 36.0 inches (914 mm), with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city.

          "Our 5 year old daughter had fun but the older children seemed a little bored. In general, the activities are attractive but they\u2019re nothing more than any other science museum offers. We were disappointed to find out that IMAX had been closed for two months and the giant model of",
          "This is a great place for adults and children to get hands on experience in science. The egg drop was great along with the making of a rocket out of paper and shooting it to see how far it would go. We attended most of the interactive shows and were not disappointed. We even",
          "We went to the parking garage across the science center to park since that is where the website said to park. It was full, as was every parking area around the area. I guess there is a farmers market on Saturday mornings from 9-12, which crowds the area. We ended up parking",
          "We are a family with 2 adults and 2 children. We had and unexpected afternoon in Des Moines and decided to go to the Science Center of Iowa. We were pleasantly surprised with SCI. Our kids are 7 and 4 and we spent about 3 hours at the center and the kids were fully engaged the",
          "The place is small but amazing. It\u2019s a place where you can find some interesting activities and lear about the space and science",
          "We\u2019ve been SCI members for 5 years. With 5 kids, it\u2019s the only way to go. And we love the science center, especially the Bubble Bay and the Rocket Blast. But exhibits don\u2019t change often, so it\u2019s difficult to see how we\u2019ll keep this membership as the kids get older. We\u2019ve",
          "My grandkids had a wonderful time doing and looking at different things. The feeding of the turtles, making paper rockets and gauging distance they could achieve, looking at a giant biosphere, etc. We had a good time at the Imax watching the pandas. This is a good place to",
          "There are so many things to do that are fun for children of all ages. Even adults can have fun with the displays. This is a great place to go any time of the year. The surround screen movies are great too.",
          "We are members at the science center of Iowa, and joined primarily to get free entrance into museums in other cities such as Chicago and Denver. However we occasionally visit this location to check out the exhibits that change from time to time. The dinosaur one was fun,",
          "We visited the Science Center with our two kids, ages 7 and 8. We planned to be there for about 2 hours. We stayed for 3 hours and would have stayed longer if it wasn't closing time. The fireworks session was a favorite!",
          "This wasn\u2019t a planned stop on our trip but I am so glad we gave it a try. My three year old loves dinosaurs and the Science Center delivered! He was mesmerized. I also enjoyed how large and spread out the exhibits were, plenty of room to roam without feeling overwhelmed or",
          "We visited here on a frigid -23 F day and thought it would be overcrowded, but the center is so large that this was not a problem. Wide range of activities for all ages, and there were so many favorites that we will keep going back. Great job to all who developed this center!",
          "My children and grandchildren and I spent an afternoon here over the Christmas holiday. It was a very busy place which, to me, meant it was popular for families. Granted, it seemed to be directed mainly at children but the adults in our group loved watching the children play",
          "The children's rooms were very fun for my 3-yr old grandson. We took him there to see the dinosaurs, but was more interested in the fruits and vegetable play area and the giant bubbles.",
          "We have been here several times this summer. Friendly staff. Clean. Many screaming kids. Marcydiner tantrum scale of 3/5 this last visit. They have issues with the starlight theater planetarium at times. Our pass gives us ample time to spend here. The kids LOVE the ball wall.",
          "I saw Dunkirk at the Blank IMAX theater dome and was impressed. I'd never been to an IMAX before and enjoyed how large the screen was and how it swallowed you up into the movie. The place was very clean and even without admission into the science centre i was still able to get",
          "We visited on a very hot Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. There's many interactive exhibits geared towards kids, but as adults we had a great time as well. Highlights include building and launching paper rockets, don't break the egg drop, building a keystone arch,",
          "For what it cost it was pretty small. Other science centers we have visited have had a lot more activities. But our son had fun so that's all that matters",
          "I love a good science museum and have been to a number of them, but this is a real gem. Kids were everywhere doing hands-on things. Very educational, entertaining, and a safe environment. The I-Max has several shows from which to choose every hour. The restaurant had good",
          "The 2nd Friday of the month is family day with $5 admission to the museum or $5 admission to the Imax theater. I choose the movie and $5 is less than a matinee at a regular theater. Great deal!",
          "There are some really solid exhibits for kids, plenty of hands on activities. Even though this place is clearly geared towards kids, adults can find some enjoyment for special showings of movies in IMAX theater. Have to pay for parking which I think should be at least validated",
          "If you want to learn something new; or feel smart or not so smart, the Science Center is for you. After your science fun, take in an IMAX movie.",
          "We were here on a Thursday and there were many kids from buses here as well. I bought the grandparents' pass, so we can go when we want. The pros are the IMAX theater, the presentations, the starlight theater and the various activities for kids. The cons are the parking, $3 for",
          "We used our ASTC reciprocal pass, and still had to pay for one child. There are some great exhibits in the museum, especially on the second floor where you can create your own air rocket (and launch it) as build cars out of legos and race them down a track. My son spent a good",
          "SC of I could do with little lowering of its prices otherwise this is a good place to spend a day with kids. The IMAX Dome is spectacular but the seating needs upgrade.",
          "I went here with my daughter and she really enjoyed it. We went during the week and there was not a lot of traffic. Some of the exhibits were needing some upkeep and repair, but overall a decent way to spend a few hours.",
          "The science center is a nice place to go several different times. They have a family night each month, were you can get discounts on admissions, movie, and a restaurant meal etc. check out the website for more info.",
          "Not much to do and most activities were broken and worn. Staff were slow and minimally tolerant of guests. So much empty space with nothing to see or do. I don't understand why anyone is paying to come here! On a positive note, there were lots of hand sanitizer stations, in",
          "Kids will love it. Very interactive and fun. Great demonstration. Parking is an issue and a bit difficult to get there. Food court is good but spendy. Storage lockers for coats etc. are only 50 cents.",
          "Great place. Most exhibits are for middle school or younger but today we were here from Arizona and they had 2 great IMAX movies. Dream Big and National parks adventure and my 16 year old and I loved.",
          "This was my family's first visit to the Science Center. The lack of parking was almost enough to keep us from entering. The admission I thought was high especially when you have to pay for parking. Hopefully the parking problem is a temporary issue bc of all the construction",
          "IMAX tickets are expensive now, but the experience is worth it. No other movie experience, including traditional IMAX theaters, are as immersive as what you'll have in this dome. Don't be fooled by Omniplexes - they aren't the same thing. Take advantage of sale days and SCI",
          "I think it goes without saying: don't go during Spring Break. However, I'm saying it. I went during Spring Break for some reason. The place is kind of a nightmare with the amount of kids. Also, with construction going on on condos and a new Hy-vee, parking took about 20+",
          "This is a very interesting and educational place to visit and good place to take your children for the education it has so many different exhibits",
          "Been going for years, but no more. Way over priced, over crowded, and lousy parking situation. Value here has diminished over the years, especially with their \"alacarte\" pricing on many things. They have some cool stuff on occasion, but mostly disappointing.",
          "Went with a friend and our children. Great fun for our toddlers! And, we had fun too! Lots to do and great fun learning! The cafeteria is nice too! Next time, I want to do the imax too.",
          "Just can't say enough about the wonderful opportunities for all ages to experience science in a positive educational environment!!!",
          "We've been members of the science center for a few years, and my daughter absolutely loves coming here. The planetarium was recently remodeled and offers a lot of great features throughout the day. They also have traveling exhibits that go through the science center, so things",
          "We had 3 grandkids with us for our visit here. What a fun place with many different experiences, all hands-on. The ages ranged from 5 to 12 and we all really enjoyed it. There were activities for all of us, including the adults.",
          "We have a relatively new building for our Science Center which is South of the center of downtown. There is a parking garage across the street. There are special exhibits and special programs advertised monthly. There is an Imax theater. I take my relatives there when they",
          "An amazing venue for children and adults alike! I know my level of anticipation equals the 5 grandkids 6-11 (I'm early 70's); have attended four years straight. We usually stay around two hours though could easily double that. Attending presentations are a highlight though",
          "Very nice place and lots of activities. After visiting with my teen, we realized she enjoyed it much more when she was younger. The new music area was enjoyable.",
          "My wife and I went to visit the museum as new arrivals to Des Moines. The museum has great interactive exhibits for younger children (3-12, in my estimation), but is lacking anything for adults. Once we get some grandchildren, we will bring them to see.",
          "We arrived at the Museum 15 minutes after they opened. The young man at the entrance was very polite and patient with us. Our children, ages 14, 10 and 5 enjoyed the exhibits and shows very much. Andrea did a wonderful job with her show about the digestive system and with",
          "I spent a full Saturday here with four grandchildren aged 3 to 9. We were not in a hurry, so we enjoyed every room and exhibit for as long as the kids wanted. It was very interactive and interesting for them. Just large enough to have plenty of variety. We broke up the day",
          "Great experience, the staff went above and beyond today, especially Renee and Laura! Wonderful place for kids of all ages!",
          "We were in Des Moines for only one day. Went to The National Park Adventure movie, narrated by Robert Redford, which was playing at the IMAX Theater. What a fabulous show. You will fall in love with the National Park system and be beguiled by Mother Nature. We did not visit",
          "I loved going here when I was a kid I love going their now. We have not been there since I was 11. I think they need more older kid activities to allow more aged families enjoy it to. The year I went s not on here so I picked the only one close enough. I'm 14 now to give you a",
          "There were all ages for children to delight in. I went with the 10 year old with the electrical things. The 1 and 3 year old had an area of their own. It is well worth it to see!!!",
          "We started with the IMAX Beautiful Planet show which was exciting and informative. Headed to the hands on tool area and then Legos. After to the activity area which included building Lego race cars with a 4 car racetrack, building a rocket and a dam to control the flow of water.",
          "Contacted SCI about a HUGE safety concern on 8/30. As of 3 weeks later, they haven't bothered to look into it nor reach back out to me at all. Parents with disabled children: they don't accommodate them. Parents with children who have allergies: they allow free grazing",
          "We had a free afternoon in Des Moines over the holiday weekend, and decided to take our 3 kids to the science center. I really wish we had more time to spend here, there was so much to do and our boys (ages 4, 10, 12) loved it. There were exhibits that were suited for our older",
          "It's a really educational place for (kids) lots of activities but I do not recommend this place just for adults or teens",
          "Adults and parents who wish to instill a growing and lifelong interest in science will take their own children and classrooms to the Science Center of Iowa throughout grade school and into middle school.",
          "For my visit I would give it 3 stars. It is not really the kind of place for adults without children. I did give it 4 stars because it is a great place to go if you take children of any age. There is so much to explore in space, energy, geology, most areas of science. For",
          "We have been family members of the Science Center for two years now and we visit at least monthly for about two to three hours, typically late in the afternoon to just run around and blow off steam. My boys always visit the same places and love them. We go to the \"grocery area\",",
          "Lots of hands on activities for all ages and good temporary exhibits that change every few months. My 9 year old could spend hours at the ball wall and in the town simulation. Also great Star theater where we can lay on the floor and watch shows about various topics. Lots for",
          "Been here a couple times with the kids. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. Plenty to keep kids going for a whole day.",
          "This is a great discovery place for children. I recommend going in the middle of the week. It is also nice for raining summer days.",
          "We spent about 2 hours in the Science Center and found plenty of activities geared for the young child. 3-10 but there is a center just for the toddler age child. Good hands on activities and learning centers. Nice place to visit on a really hot or rainy day.",
          "The Science Center offers so many interesting things to do for children/families. There are many inter-active features and learning opportunities that are most interesting and educational. The IMAX theater also offers a fun experience no matter what the movie playing at the",
          "This is a SMALL science center. If you've never visited before it will be fun for about two hours at most. We have season passes and stuff never changes. There is maybe one or two floating exhibits but they are fare and few between. We just went this past weekend and there",
          "We went here with our son and daughter-in-law and 18-month-old granddaughter and had a wonderful time! There was plenty for our toddler to do and see. This would be a great place to visit with children of all ages, but would probably appeal most to pre-teens. We loved the",
          "Being a grown man that loves IMAX I was not disappointed at all. We went to go see Born to be Wild and took our 6 year old daughter. It was great and actually kept her attention which is not easy to do. The facilities were very clean and the theater is awesome.",
          "This is not a very big science museum. It is ok for small children, but it does not have very much attractions, the ones thy do have are small.",
          "My boys are 4 & 6, they had a fabulous time at the Science Center of Iowa! They learned new things too. They have a few shows during the day, we saw the fire show.....it was very neat and educational!! The boys are still talking about when we go back they are going to build a",
          "Really enjoyed our time at the SCI. Various attractions and some added \"shows\" we could see. We went to one called \"Fireworks\" and learned about fire and combustion which our girls really enjoyed. Lots of hands on opportunities for the kids and adults alike. Visited the Dome",
          "This place more than rocked! From the globe IMAX to the green weather screen to the geometry room, it was great fun for hours! Highly recommend it. It was worth the money.",
          "SCI has many activities to entertain everyone for ages. There are live shows with a science theme, great IMax movies, and many hands-on activities that delight everyone who walks through the door. The ball wall, egg drop, and paper rockets are favorites of everyone. The only",
          "There are a lot of fascinating exhibits at the DSM Science Center. Many are hands on and the kids don't even realize they're doing engineering. Special exhibits can be great also.",
          "I'll admit that I have been here for a while. But I know family that has and this is a great place to go.",
          "So much more space and the Foucault pendulum is still there. I'm not sure when it moved to the new, much larger location, but so glad they moved. My 3 and 5 year olds had a blast in various parts. I will definitely go back!",
          "We visited on our way through Iowa using our reciprocal program. They charge you extra if you have more than 2 children! We have visited 20 museums with the program and not had this happen before! I paid it thinking this must be a very good museum and must be worth it! It was",
          "One of the greatest things that is the use and acknowledgment of the reciprocity program. There is an entire network all over the US where you can go and enjoy what these places have to offer for free or a discounted price. Des Moines Science Center did not disappoint by",
          "We drove from Texas to visit my dad over spring break. Turns out our spring break was a week earlier than Iowa, which made it the perfect time to visit the Science Center! We had such a lovely afternoon...with minimal crowds, the kids were able to do all of the hands-on",
          "SCI has many activities to entertain your family for 4 or more hours. There are live shows with a science theme, great IMax offerings, and many hands-on activities that delight kids of all ages. The ball wall, egg drop, and paper rockets were favorites of the 6 year-old that",
          "Clean & good food The Imax dome theatre is wonderful! Best way to watch a movie. Worth every pennies!",
          "Interactive exhibits for all ages make the Science Center of Iowa a great place to spend a chilly afternoon, especially if entertaining school age children.",
          "We \"only\" had 3 hours to spend here and that wasn't nearly long enough....especially for a first visit. This is a great space with a lot of room. I brought my teenager and my two younger sons and they all had stuff to keep them busy. The little kids got a lot more out of it",
          "There are so many interesting things to see and do one can't get bored even young children. The IMAX is a great experience also.",
          "Really fun place to take the family there is something for every age person! The theater is something worth going to! Go back every couple of months as it is always changing.",
          "I hoped the science center would be similar to the science museum in Chicago (geared toward everyone of all ages), but it wasn't. However, my husband and I had a nice time just walking around and playing with some of exhibits. The kids we encountered there seemed to have a good",
          "This particular Science center has one of the better IMAX theaters that I've been to. It also has a ton of seating but I would strongly recommend you get there early to find the seat you would prefer. As for the Science Center itself, I have always been impressed with the ever",
          "We were there for a wedding reception and it was very nice. It was great the young people and children could entertain themselves with all of the fun stuff at the center",
          "My husband had not seen Star Wars yet so we thought we would spend the extra money and go to IMAX. If you buy your tickets on line make sure to stop off at the desk and get your ticket/receipt as they have no way to give you a ticket when you go into the theater. We went early",
          "What a great place to see Star Wars the only problem was the stopped the film in the very beginning probably to let the rest of the people get seated.",
          "I saw Star Wars at the IMAX there. We sat in the front row. You could only see the characters necks and part of their chin from there. Being a 4 year Iraq war disabled vet who walks with a cane I would have liked to walk down the 4 steps to get out when the show was over.",
          "My kids are 8 and 7, both of them loved this place. The staff was friendly and it provided a great place to learn things about how things work.",
          "This is a nice Science Center/Children's Museum. I took my 5 yr old son there Friday night and the place was near empty. He talked me into taking him back on Saturday and it was packed because of a lego building contest going on. Still a very nice visit and large/open enough",
          "visted the Center for the 4th or 5th time and still find it to be a great time and good value. The Center brings in new exhibits on a regular basis and maintain their long running exhibits. I always see families enjoying themselves and packaged with other close attractions you",
          "Love love love this place, great place to take the kids for a day full of fun and learning. New stuff to do every time",
          "Our family found the Science Center of Iowa worth the trip. We've been to a large number of science museums and children's museums and this was certainly above average. Our kids really enjoyed the aerodynamics experience of building an air-powered rocket and seeing how far it",
          "We had a great time at the Science Center. The kids loved the demonstrations and hands on activities. There were exhibits for all interests, from space to atoms, from chemistry to genetics. This is a place we will surely visit again.",
          "The Science Center of Iowa is one of my favorite, if not the favorite, place to take my family. We make the drive from Fort Dodge at least twice a year. There is always something fun and engaging for all ages. No fuss over being bored. My husband, being the science lover that he",
          "The Science Center offers a lot of fun activities designed to encourage interest in science, and kids love it. I'm not going to talk about any of that. IMAX all the way. The center houses an exceptional IMAX theater that plays a lot of informative documentaries, but also plays",
          "The Science Center is somewhere I used to go all the time as a kid. Lately though, I have been attending their mixology nights, and even a few times as a field trip with my preschool class. They have really stepped up their game as of late, and have been offering programs that",
          "Fun for all ages. The interesting solar system display. Many activities - rockets, race cars and dominoes were th he favorite.",
          "This was great for our pre-school kids, and I would imagine elementary school students would be amused as well. We went on a Thursday morning in the summer and had the place to ourselves.",
          "So we went when they had the dinosaur displays. They don't always have them. My boys had a pretty good time there but it would not be worth the huge price to get in without the dinosaurs for sure. I would never recommend going there unless you are seeing a special limited time",
          "Good for little kids. We made the mistake of thinking it was larger than it was. Admission was 20 dollars for two people with a coupon off the travel Des Moines site. We took note this is an extremely interactive place for children and could keep them entertained for hours.",
          "The kids love the hands on activities, the star theater and play area. We have had memberships that are great for going for a few hours especially on a raining day.",
          "There are only a few rooms of activities at the Science Center. And there is a lot of open space in the middle of it all. The kids think it's fun but we only go once a year. We visit other cities and go to their Science Centers and wonder why ours is so lame.",
          "Very nice place to spend the day with grandkids they have decent prices only thing that I wasn't please about was street parking otherwise fun place great staff",
          "We bought a membership again this year for the Science Center and need to use it more. Stopped in to watch the original Jurassic Park in the IMAX theater and kids really enjoyed the experience. Pretty neat and scary on the big screen! Spent an hour beforehand letting the kids",
          "Been there many times with the grandkids and they always enjoy it. We went in July and I actually though they would be to big (ages 11 and 13) and they enjoyed it just as much as they did when they were younger.",
          "Not a lot of street parking near by. Prices are pretty good. The kids had a great time and we stayed several hours. The demonstrations and iMax are also worth seeing.",
          "My wife and I cam specifically to see the planetarium show. On arrival we were told the facility was broken and there was no repair date. I asked to see the director and was told the director doesn't work weekends (when most of the visitors show up and parents bring their",
          "Hours of unique fun for kids of all ages. The Imax was fun I loved the dome room. This place is a must see for parents looking to entertain children.",
          "My two (almost three) year old could have stayed here all day I'm pretty sure. They have a fantastic offering of activities for anyone from probably age 2-8. Up to age 12 would probably have fun for an hour or so...anything beyond that, it's probably hit and miss (depending on",
          "There were 2 levels of exploring, live educational talks/demonstrations. A build it/test it/STEM area for 'scientific play' that my kids loved. There was a nature area which displayed live snakes and frogs. There were some stuffed birds and animals. It is very similar to the",
          "Getting in the door was a hassle. Showed pass ID . Girls were not very friendly. Kids said it was ok nothing special. Probably wouldn't go back.",
          "This should be top 3 in your itinerary!! I went with a 3 year old, 4 year old, husband, and senor citizens and I believe that ALL of them found it enjoyable. This is a suitable location to visit for a few hours (4-5) the kids especially loved the rocket launcher.",
          "My nephew (7) loves coming here when he is in town. Lots of hands on for an energetic mischief maker. Unfortunately the exhibits do not change & there aren't as many as one might expect based on the size of the building. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to walk through the last time",
          "We went for the IMAX (saw the Lemur film), but stayed for lunch and some exploration. The film was great, with a fun and informative short on how the IMAX screen & surround sound works showing before the feature. The cafeteria was expensive, as cafeterias are; but the pizza was",
          "My husband and I drove 2 hours to check this place out and spend some time in Des Moines and boy was I disappointed. We went without kids and there wasn't much to see. Even if I had kids, I don't think we would have spent that much longer there. The place is pretty big, but",
          "Not worth visiting, unless you have small children. Everything is broken! There are no attractions that amuses the adult or older teens. Everything is for small children. They need to learn from the pro science centers like Phoenix. Place should be renamed as Des Moines Small",
          "We were here from 9:30-4:00. The planetarium was closed which was disappointing, but it was advertised as closed so we knew in advance. Lots of hands on things, even for a teenager. One issue: the 'programs' changed locations from what the daily program stated and we missed the",
          "We took the kids to the Science center, they had alot for them to do and it was a blast. It was right in the center of downtown des moines the city is alot nicer from the last time I was here. Would def come again if the family comes again!",
          "We paid 20 dollars for my son and I to get in the science section only. We did not watch any movies. It took about 1.5 hours to complete the whole thing. My 6-year-old son was interested in the bubbles and playing with the fake fruits. I don't understand the reasons for all",
          "It's good but pretty quickly can be gone through. If it had the same approach like the science center in Omaha it would be better. It's a one and done type place.",
          "really full of very interesting science items laid out so you can understand how they work in laymans terms. this is well worth the visit as there is so much to see. you will like this venue as they took a lot of time and effort to put on a good program. Anyone will have a good",
          "I have children from 16 to 6. The youngest one still enjoys the Science Center, but the rest don't even want to go. We usually are completely done in 1.5 hours so the admission fee feels pretty steep. IMax was extra and the movie was ok. Gift shop is fun, you do not need to",
          "Was great for our kids (ages 10 & 6) and they enjoyed the IMAXX theater. Not over priced but not cheap either once you get through the gift shop on the way out.",
          "Two of us went - adults - and found out quickly that it's geared towards kids. We still had a good time, but it was a little boring for adults. Lesson learned :)",

          "Great place to explore silence. Lots of hands on exhibits. More to do than you might think. We took 10 people and the cost was still very reasonable.",

          "I wouldn't call it a 'must see' if you're visiting Des Moines, but it's definitely a quality family attraction. Personally, after having been there a few times, I'm more likely to go when there is a special exhibit. The permanent exhibits are best for younger children, and there",
          "Each of our 3 grandsons spends 1 wk with us and a visit to the Science Ctr is a request we get by all 3 every year. Parking ramp nearby for easy access. Wish some exhibits would be updated and/or changed out more often.",
          "We had attended the Science Center through the years, but it didn't hold our kids attention long enough. We thought it was too expensive for a family activity for the regular exhibits. They just held their first Mini Maker Faire, we used a GroupOn coupon, so it was 1/2 off",

          "As our children are getting older (ages 8 & 9) we have started relying more on Science Centers and less on Children's Museums as a form of hands on fun and education. This facility was large and many exhibits looked brand new so we were initially excited when we walked in. But",

          "We were looking for something to do while my husband had meetings (we came in from out if town). We arrived right as they opened, and really enjoyed very low crowds for the first hour. After that, the place filled up very quickly with a couple of school groups and several",

          "Our family spends at least 1-2 weekends a month there and they love it. It's perfect-sized for a few hours on a weekend, and the shows are fun.",
          "So much to do and see, even for a 3 year old. We enjoyed learning about \"One World, One Sky\" with Sesame Street characters in the Star Theatre during our visit. Small Discoveries is always our first stop. This is a wonderful place to spend several hours on a rainy day!",
          "This is for elementary school children. They don't tell you that. They just take your $11 and hand you a map. There is little to interest adults. I see no reason for an adult to visit unless it is with family or as a chaperone for school events. There is nothing of museum",
          "Looking for fun and education? Or even just something to do that doesn't require a parka and snow boots in the winter? This is a great attraction.",
          "We have taken our grandkids and have gone on our own, and both experiences have been wonderful. The exhibits and activities are varied enough to tickle the imagination and broaden the mind of any age group.",
          "While visiting friends, our two families spent an entire afternoon at the science center. The kids were aged 4, 5, 6, and 8. The highlights for our group was the \"make your own rocket\", the snakes/weather broadcasting, and the imax movie. The facility was very clean, laid out",
          "The grandchildren AND Grandparents were thrilled! The dinosaurs were huge. There was an excavation area and the children learned to brush and excavate a site appropriately.",
          "I brought my six year old here for half a day and she had a blast. There are a number of exhibits all of which are appropriate for younger children. There were also a few presentations (toys in space was one) that held the interest of my daughter. I don't think there would be",
          "We were there when the Da Vinci exhibit was on display, and a fine one it was. We enjoyed all of it! There are some interesting interactive things to do also. We were there on off hours, when kids were in school. It was not too croweded when we first got there, but before we",
          "My son is 5 and loves the Science Center. I think he would go every week if we could. I'm not sure how older kids would like it, but for preschool and elementary aged it's great. They also have excellent travelling exhibits, like the T-Rex.",
          "Nothing to brag about, your average science center. But as a ASCT memeber I get to go into free so why not!",
          "I would recommend taking children to the Science Center, there is so much to see and do, they really liked it. There is a lot of hands on craft things, it was a lot different than I had expected, the kids love it. Yes, go see it for yourself, nice on a rainy day. Carolyn H",
          "We have 3 kids (5, 8 & 10) and we managed to see and do it all in less than 2 hours and we were all a little bored. We live in MPLS so we have a large Science Museum here so hard to compare to that. Just glad that we went on the Family Friday night while we were in town so it",
          "This was our first visit and we loved it! They have areas for kids of all ages (including a special toddler room) with tons of hands on activities. Also their free shows are a MUST SEE! Iowa Skies and Deep Freeze were really cool.",
          "This was our second visit, we purchased a membership the first time knowing we would be back in town visiting family throughout the year. I like that they rotate in new displays on the bottom floor. I am afraid that the kids will get bored with the upstairs areas after a couple",
          "Our kids (ages 4,6,8) had a great time at the Science Center. We stayed about three hours and the kids were interested the whole time. The museum is interactive with lots of different experiments and ideas. I like that several of the exhibits could be manipulated by all three",
          "This is a great place to spend a day with the kids or grandkids. There are many hands on displays for the children to do and learn from. Also many displays to read and learn from. Not only is this place entertaining but very educational. Adults will also find this place",
          "Great lectures made fun ! kids loved+want to go back again,I'm sure we will! Probably a better fit for kids a little older,there seemed to be a lot of babies getting in the way. If your kids can't say+ spell Science,they are too young. Take them when they are older+ can get",
          "We spent the day from open to close here. A t-rex named sue exhibit was there along with the iowa state science team. My kids learned about dinosaurs, nano science, they did a ton of experiments. They enjoyed the acting out being a weatherman with the green screen. They got",
          "So fascinating! Educational! Fun things to do! A lot of hands on learning for the kids and everyone else. Loved the IMAX movie! Wish I could go more often.",
          "We went here and I guess we were expecting alot more then it was? I think kids would enjoy it alot more then we did.. the best part of the whole center is the sky dome. other then that it's completely forgetable. boring and has about 4 rooms.",
          "Would be good for 3-7 year old. Not much for older 10+ kids to do. Loud and not very well kept up. Carpets could use a good cleaning, and bathrooms not well stocked.",
          "It is very pricey for the little bit it is. It really does not have that musch at it. The exhibits and Imax theater cost extra.Not suitable for children under 4",
          "The science center offers fun activities for the kids. We have a membership and have gone frequently so I can say that as an adult I am worn out with it. But they get a new themed exhibit a couple times a year that we go check out. They have food which is actually pretty",
          "Location is easily found and parking most times is easily available. With kids, the entrance time can seem very long. It will be difficult to get close up to exhibits during busy times. Encourage them, however, to work hands-on as the exhibits will be more meaningful. It's",
          "Over-priced - not sure how the average Iowa family with kids could afford it - too crowded with children, definitely NOT for adults who love science looking to learn more. I miss the old Science Center; it was less Disneyfied.",
          "We spent a Saturday afternoon here with out 7-year-old daughter who is very interested in science. We had a lovely time as a family! We saw the T-rex exhibit (it is a traveling exhibit, not permanent). Upstairs was by far the best part of our visit. The star room where they",
          "Our extended family visited the museum on Easter Saturday, a very busy day. The museum is perfect for children of many ages. The staff were attentive, and despite a large number of attendees, one did not feel crowded or pressured. The ZAP show involved the children and was",
          "We spent two lovely days at the science center with a 3 year old and a 5 year old. The 5 year old really enjoyed the presentations on the great hall. The speakers are very engaging and describe the concepts simply, but use correct terms like sublimation. The Sue dinosaur exhibit",
          "This is a kids hands on Science center. My grandson got to \"dig\" for dinosaur bones, make a rocket and fly it and played for hours. The toddler room has a \"fishing\" area and a bubble table. We had a really great day, So many activities and not enough time!",
          "I took my 2-year old niece and 6-year old nephew to the SCI and we enjoyed the time. There are enough hands on activities to keep the kids engaged. They have a spot for kinders which is nice as the activity center upstairs is for 6+ year old kids. We went to the IMAX and saw the",
          "We had a great time. Sue the T-Rex was on display, and my 6 year old HAD to see \"her\". The star lab was amazing, and their learning center upstairs would have kept the kids entertained for hours on end. Big enough to have lots of fun things for the kids, but not so big that the",
          "Having visited a Science Center in a neighboring state, I was pretty disappointed by my home state's center. The exhibits are good, if starting to look a little worse for wear, but staff is scarce. This would be a good half-day visit with kids 4-10 who are interested in",
          "I love science museums but this one is very disappointing. Took my Grandson and felt that we wasted a couple of hours. It was very expensive and not impressive.",
          "It had been several years since I had been there (they had even moved to a newer & nicer location)...Most of it was geared to the younger children (teenage & below) for the hands on portion but it was a nice way to spend a rainy day with the great-grand children and their",
          "I have two small children ages 3 and 6. They love the Des Moines Science Center. There are several areas for the kids to be hands on which they love. Every few months management will bring in a new exhibit. Some are good and some not so good. They also have an I Max Theater",

          "We are members of a reciprocal museum, so our visit was free, otherwise, we would have been upset because this place is pretty pricey. The museum feels empty, the exhibits just weren't that engaging, we learned some interesting things from the movie on early space flight and",
          "There were some neat things there, but it was only enough to keep an 8-year-old entertained for about an hour (the IMAX film we wanted was sold out and she was NOT interested in the Mars exhibit). I suppose it was because of the Mars exhibit, but the exhibits seemed heavily",

          "PROS: easy street or covered parking; ASCI member (fellow museum members are free); different exhibits (hands-on and educational); IMAX attraction; Wi-fi available. The kids loved the live animal exhibits (snakes, snapping turtle). CONS: around a 1 hour attraction ( unless your",

          "The SCI (Science Center of Iowa) is a small science museum located in downown Des Moines. The core exhibits are pretty basic. An IMAX theatre is one of the big attractions. SCI features travelling exhibits which are sometimes quite good. Summer camps for children are well",

          "The first floor is for toddlers and per-schoolers. Upstairs was okay. It was clean, but not that interesting. The exhibits weren't geared toward older kids as mine, ages 10, 11, and 14 didn't learn much new. A couple exhibits were fun for them, like the egg drop and building the",
          "We have been to several Science Centers. This looked like a good place for young children, but there is very little for older children. I think it is even limited for any child over 8 years old. There were a few very nice exhibits, but unless you use a map, it is hard to get",
          "We had a great time there. My only (minor) complaint was that we ran out of things to do pretty quickly. More a place to spend an hour to an hour and a half than an afternoon.",
          "this is a great place to bring kids for hands on learning for all ages.",
          "Attended with a first grade class and the kids loved being there and all the attractions. My favorite was the IMAX star show.",
          "Big and new but not a lot to see. Not worth the cost of admission.",
          "The building was so big, and yet there was so much space in there. They could easily add more attractions and information.",
          "I took my 2 boys down the Science Center of Iowa. I had pre-planned and checked out the website in advance and noticed they had a new Mars exhibit coming. Being the space buffs we are, thought it would be great to get a membership and enjoy a discount. So we trotted on down late",

          "The science center is small (we saw all of the exhibits in a couple of hours) but the exhibits are well put together and interesting. The planetarium is by far the most exciting exhibit. Visitors can choose their own star show sequences on a computer and then go inside the",

          "I'll try and keep this short. I think the Science center had the possibility to be really great but those that planned and selected the main exhibits (not the traveling ones) did a poor job. The place is style over substance. Most exhibits have a preschool feel to them and most",
          "My 8 year old daughter and I visited the Science Center for Bodies in Motion. It was FABULOUS! My daughter was intrigued the entire length of our stay! We have visited the IMAX theatre and other exhibits in the past, and have ALWAYS had a wonderful time!",

          "We went to the science center with out 6 and 9 year olds. The Egypt exhibt was going when we were there. My 6 year old was fascinated by the mummy! The food is beyond wonderful in the little food court area and the staff was exceptional. The center itself was mediocre, no",
          "We recently saw the exhibition of Leonardo Da Vinci's inventions. Very thoughtprovoking! Currently there is an exhibit on Ancient Egypt.",
          "If you have younger kids, 3-9 year olds, this pass to the zoo and Science Center is totally worth it. We go about once a month, the kids like the exhibits which typically change about every quarter. They also have a huge IMAX screen.",
          "We stayed with the main exhibits which was a rather small selection due to the large area taken by the special exhibits. There are still a good number of interactive areas. I think that me and my wife had just as much fun as our 2yr old. But there we no descriptions of what",
          "Nice place to spend the day with the family. We've gone to the Da Vinci and Body Vital exhibits. Nice way to spend a day, just wish it was more affordable for the middle-class family. I would go on a weekend. SOme of their year-round areas are getting a bit worn down and could",
          "Body Works was great! Nothing like the nervous system to get you thinking! The rest of the place is neat, but nothing huge to comment on. A bit expensive for what it was, but worth it ;)",
          "My wife and I have enjoyed many other science centers we've visited. But, if you don't have kids with you, do not visit this place. First, you have to pay to park your car which isn't mentioned until you get there. And it is pay by the hour, so it feels like they don't even want",

It was built by cosmetic magnate Carl Weeks and his wife, Edith Van Slyke Weeks, between 1923 and 1928. Salisbury House was modeled after the King's House in Salisbury, England, contains 42 rooms and measures just over 22,000 square feet (2,000 m2). The property is owned and operated by the Salisbury House Foundation and is open to the public for tours, public events, and private rentals.\nSalisbury House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The listing covered a 9.4-acre (3.8 ha) area with two contributing buildings, one other contributing structure and one contributing site. Salisbury House is also on the List of Registered Historic Places in Iowa.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n1923 to 1928: Constructed and furnished with an original budget of $150,000, the final cost was $3 million.\n1926: Carl and Edith Weeks and their four sons move into Salisbury House.\n1934: Carl and Edith Weeks donate Salisbury House to Drake University; they retain ownership of the House's collections and furnishings, and pay rent to Drake as tenants until 1954.\n1954: Iowa State Education Association (ISEA) purchased Salisbury House and its collections from Drake University and the Weeks Family for $180,000 and began using it as office space.\n1993: Salisbury House Foundation was formed to preserve, interpret and share the property for the cultural and educational benefit of the public.\n1998: Salisbury House Foundation purchased the property and collections from ISEA for $4.0 million.\n1999: Operation of Salisbury House as a historic house museum began.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Weeks Family amassed extensive collections of fine art, decorative art, rare books, musical instruments, historic documents, weapons and sculpture, and most of their holdings remain in Salisbury House to this day. However, in the summer of 2019, Grinnell College purchased the library of Carl and Edith Weeks and moved the collection of approximately 3,000 volumes and 2,500 historic documents to Burling Library on the Grinnell College campus.  The collection remains open for research by the public, and Grinnell continues to collaborate with Salisbury House on programming involving the magnificent collection.\nThe Salisbury House Foundation offers various tour packages that allow visitors to experience many highlights from the Weeks Family's collections.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSalisbury House Website\nSalisbury House Blog",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) quite often. Snowfall averages 35.3 inches (90 cm) per season, and annual precipitation averages 36.0 inches (914 mm), with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city.

          "The complex building is superb and the collection is too. You wouldn't expect so much masterpieces in such a \"regional museum\" and I don't understand why it isn't better known. Who says there is nothing to see in Iowa???",
          "The Des Moines Art Center surely must be on your list of attractions to visit in Des Moines. It's collection is very decent. Location is great, right in a beautiful park and in a nice neighborhood too. But the main feature is architecture. Three most prominent architects from",
          "I have lived in Des Moines for over 20 years and this was my first visit. I did not make it through the entire center but it does have good art. The current exhibition is sketches and drawings. There are plaques on the wall to identify the artist and year as well as guards",
          "We have visited galleries in various cities in the U.S., Canada, South America, and Europe. The Des Moines Art Center is not large, but I was surprised to see work by Warhol, Courbet, Hopper, Moore, and Picasso in a relatively small museum in America's Heartland. They had a",

          "The Museum has a trio of buildings, each by a famous architect (Saarinen, Pei, and Maier), and somehow they all work together to provide wonderful spaces to display the artwork. The permanent collection focuses on US and some European art of the last 125 years, and includes some",
          "Great permanent collection, wonderful displays. Wide variety of modern styles and artists. The archeture wings are \"displays\" of modern art all on their own! You can't beat the price either! The surrounding park lands and outdoor displays are wonderful as well. You can't go",

          "Definitely it was some shock to see Radin sculpture there and some painting of Matis. Warhol was more predictable as each US museum should have a piece of good US art. It is fee admission so you not risk anything just you expose yourself on good art.",
          "Traveling through Des Moines Iowa, we took in this art museum. Most of the museum was not type of art that I prefer. My preference is for realism, but I did manage to find some that was interesting. I did find the gallery of Virginia Maier photos to be fascinating. How she",

          "One of Des Moines' best kept secrets. While the museum is known for its visiting modern art exhibits, exceptional classical artists work abound. Both indoor and outdoor works make this nearly hidden gem, a park like setting in a beautiful, old oak woods. The adjacent rose garden",
          "I'd last been there over 50 years ago, when it was first build and had mostly modern art. I remember thinking at the time, \"Why can't American art museums have more pictures?\" Let's just say, what an improvement! The building is lovely, the docents are friendly and",
          "I recently had the opportunity to return to the town of my birth which was more years ago than I care to remember. I was astounded to see the transformation that has taken place in Des Moines. One of the finest examples would be the Des Moines Art Center. The galleries are",

          "This is a FREE museum that would do very well in many cities around the world. Especially considering this in Des Moines, this is a great place to visit. They have pieces from world-renowned artists such as Claude Monet and Georgia O'Keefe. I highly recommend this museum if",
          "This is not the Louvre, Prado, Uffizi, or the Met which are all over the top amazing, but for a small museum it has a nice collection of well known artists including Monet, Rodin, Matisse, Warhol, Cassatt, Rothko, Segal, and others. And of course, the Iowa artist, Grand Wood.",
          "The museum has a great collection. The tour guide Paul was very knowledgeable and offered insight to the building as well as the pieces. The Lichtenstein pyramid, Maya Lin rock field, and The Flock II by Abakanowicz to name a few. Paul asked the group for their opinion of",

          "I figured a free art museum I would buzz in and out shortly. I was suprised! I would have paid a good bit and I'm cheap. A wide variety of art and the descriptions of paintings is not to miss as they made each piece more special.",
          "There are many reasons to visit the Des Moines Art Center if you have two hours or so. The architecture of the three secions of the building is unique. The initial section was designed in 1945 by Eliel Saarinen. In the 1960's, I. M. Pei designed a large two-story middle section",
          "While this is one of the smaller art exhibits I've been to I was most impressed by the architecture of the building itself (there is also beautiful history behind the building itself). The exhibits change frequently so you are easily able to go back for multiple visits. Plus,",

          "Very inspiring time. Only problem was that many parts of the center were closed for various reasons. Restaurant was closed too. Some guards were little more talkative. Whistling... I'm a quiet art observer. Lady at the front desk was super nice and helpful. I had a great time.",
          "We came to see the regionalists artist like Benton but there wasn't much of that. We were pleasantly surprised at how much of the contemporary art we liked (we often don't get much out of those). There also is a nice impressionistic, expressionistic and modern works by",

          "There was really a lot of cool and different art. The fabric exhibits were featured when we were there and they were great. One in particular hangs in a stairwell area of three floors. It did not take a tremendous amount of time, but you could stay for quite a bit longer than we",
          "I keep coming back to the art center, because it does something you don't expect of a small center in a rural state. It has many pieces in various media, and rotates them constantly. Come back every couple of months, and at least half the center will be different. That's",
          "This art museum is surrounded by a pretty park with mountain biking trails. They had a beautiful reflection pool outside. The artwork is heavy on contemporary. A portion of it was closed when I went (8/7/15). some of the permanent collection on display, and the outside parts",
          "Much more than I expected. They had a fiber art exhibit that was thrilling, but I am a fiber art enthusiast. However, I believe anyone would enjoy this exhibit--very unusual. I loved the museum because it has a nice flow to it. The volunteers are so informative and helpful.",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) quite often. Snowfall averages 35.3 inches (90 cm) per season, and annual precipitation averages 36.0 inches (914 mm), with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city.

Don\u2019t bother going unless you enjoy a huge crowd, a hodgepodge of loud music on most street corners, traffic, difficulty parking and waiting in line for food.  A complete circus.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Terrace Hill, also known as Hubbell Mansion, Benjamin F. Allen House or the Iowa Governor's Mansion, is the official residence of the Governor of Iowa, United States. Located at 2300 Grand Avenue in Des Moines, it is an example of Second Empire architecture. The home measures 18,000 square feet (1,600 m\u00b2). It sits on a hill overlooking downtown Des Moines, and has a 90-foot (27 m) tower that offers a commanding view of the city. The building's steeply pitched mansard roof, open verandas, long and narrow and frequently paired windows, and bracketed eaves give this house an irreplaceable design. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nTerrace Hill was built by Benjamin Franklin Allen, the first millionaire in Iowa, as a home for his family.  The architect for this project was William Boyington, a popular Chicago architect.  Construction began in 1866, and was finished in 1869. The total cost of the project was $250,000 for the Mansion, the Carriage House, the original furnishings, and about 30 acres (120,000 m\u00b2) of land.  The house had very modern features for its time, which included hot and cold running water, indoor restrooms, an elevator, and gas lights.\nWhen the house was first built, it was on the western edge of Des Moines.  However, the city expanded westward.  As a result, Terrace Hill is now nearly in the center of the city.\nIn 1884 the mansion was bought by local Des Moines businessman F.M. Hubbell. The mansion was purchased for $60,000 from Benjamin Franklin Allen.From the time Iowa became a state in 1846 until 1947, no official residence was provided for the Governor aside from Governor William L. Harding (1917\u20131921).  In 1947 Iowa purchased an old colonial style home to serve as the residence for the Governor, but by 1970, a new home was needed to serve the needs of the Governor and the state to host visiting dignitaries.  At first, the Iowa government considered building a new home to serve as the Governor's residence. The Hubbell family\u2014the owners of Terrace Hill\u2014then offered the home to the state for use as a residence for the Governor and his family.  In the fall of 1976, Robert D. Ray became the first Governor to use Terrace Hill as his residence when he moved there with his wife Billie Ray and their three daughters.  Governors Terry Branstad (1983\u20131999, 2011\u20132017), Tom Vilsack (1999\u20132007), Chet Culver (2007\u20132011), and Kim Reynolds (2017\u2013present) have occupied Terrace Hill since then.\n\n\n== The Governor's Home ==\nTerrace Hill is located at 2300 Grand Avenue, south of Interstate 235.  Most visitors stop first at the Carriage House, which is located near the house.  Nowadays the building is used as a reception area for most visitors who arrive to tour the home.  It also contains permanent and unique changing exhibits - such as a permanent display on the previous owners of the house, the Hubbell family.\n\n\n=== The First Floor ===\nThe first floor of Terrace Hill is a formal area.  The rooms on the first floor were used often for reception of important guests, a tradition which continues.\nThe Vestibule is the entry area to the mansion.  Formerly, a servant would greet guests in the Vestibule.  They would enter through two sets of doors there that weigh more than 200 pounds (90 kg) each.\nFrom there, guests would be taken to the Reception Room.  Guests would wait while their presence was announced to the owners, and the host or hostess would greet them in that room.\nAcross the hall is the Drawing Room.  At one time it was used for weddings and funerals of the home's residents.  Now the room is used for important events - which include entertaining of foreign dignitaries.  The room also features a 7.5 foot (2.3 m) crystal chandelier, and handcarved, laminated, rosewood Belter furniture.\nThe Music Room was previously an entertainment room.  Young women would usually play music in this room.  The room features a Steinway \"Music Room Grand\" from 1869 - the same year the house was completed.\nThe Dining Room was used for formal dinners by the previous owners of the home.  Today the Dining Room continues to be used for state dinners and receptions.  Food served in the dining room is prepared in the kitchen in the basement.\nThe Library was another important room on the first floor.  It served originally as the gathering place for the men of the home, and as a storage place for knowledge.  The room contains several interesting items, which include F. M. Hubbell's leather chair.  Because he was just over 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, the chair sits close to the floor to accommodate him.  There is also a portable gentleman's \"desk\", and a partners' table, where two people could work at once.\nThe Sitting Room was the family room during earlier times.\nAll of these rooms are connected by the Main Hall.  The ceilings in the hall are 14.5 feet (4.4 m) tall.  The Main Hall has carpets by Wilton. There are also a number of interesting portraits.\nOutside there is a large porch that overlooks the downtown area.  It is still used occasionally for parties.\n\n\n=== The Second Floor ===\nAt the end of the Main Hall on the First Floor, there is a grand staircase that leads up to the Second Floor, with a landing in between.  \nAt the landing between the First and Second Floors, there is a stained glass window.  The window is often described as \"garden in glass\" and measures 9 by 13 feet (3 by 4 m).  This window colors the landing and part of the staircase with colorful light.  The window was added by F. M. Hubbell between 1884 and 1890.\nAfter the landing, the staircase divides into two approaches to the Second Floor.  Originally the Second Floor served as the bedrooms for most of the family. Now, the formal office of the Governor is located on the Second Floor (their working office is located at the Capitol).\nThe First Gentleman's office is also located on the Second Floor.  Their office is not normally part of tours because the office is used as a working office for writing speeches, scheduling appearances, and planning special events.\n\n\n=== The Third Floor and the Basement ===\nThe Governor of Iowa and their family live in the private apartment on the third floor of the house.  This floor is not normally open to tours; it opens only for special events, such as fundraisers for restoration or holiday tours.\nThe Basement, like the Third Floor, is also not open to the public.  The Governor, their family, and certain staff members have a private entrance in the basement.  A kitchen located in the basement prepares meals for special events. Also located in the basement is an Iowa State Patrol security office where an unspecified number of troopers assigned to the premises provide 24/7 protection to the Governor of Iowa and Terrace Hill property.\n\n\n== Tour information ==\nTerrace Hill is open for guided tours from 10:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday, March through December.  The tours are available at 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.  The tour usually lasts approximately 1 hour.  During December the mansion is decorated for Christmas as part of the Holly & Ivy tour, which includes several other mansions in the Des Moines area.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of governors' residences in the United States\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Iowa\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Polk County, Iowa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Terrace Hill Web Site",

For woodworkers, that means that every project in the magazine has been built in Wood's own woodworking shop; every woodworking technique published has been tried and accomplished by the editors; and every tool or product that appears in the pages of the magazine has been shop-tested and its performance evaluated.\nThere have only been three editors-in-chief in Wood's history.

        "wiki": "The World Food Prize is an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity, or availability of food in the world. Since 1987, the prize has been awarded annually to recognize contributions in any field involved in the world food supply: Animal Science/Aqua Culture, Soil Science/Water/Conservation, Nutrition/Health, Plant Science/Seed Science, Plant Pathology/Crop Protection, Food Technology/Food Safety, Policy/Research/Extension, Infrastructure/Emergency Relief, & Poverty Alleviation/Hunger. The World Food Prize Foundation is currently run by Barbara Stinson. Ms. Stinson previously served as a co-founder and Senior Partner of the Meridian Institute, a renowned non-profit organization that guides collaboration and drives action to address our world\u2019s most complex challenges. She will succeed Ambassador Kenneth M. Quinn, whose 20-year presidency established the international reputation and secured the legacy of the World Food Prize. Ms. Stinson will become the second president of the Foundation since Dr. Norman Borlaug established it in 1986.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nConceived by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman Borlaug, the prize emphasizes the importance of a nutritious and sustainable food supply for all people. Borlaug saw the prize as a means of establishing role models who would inspire others.\nIn 1985, Borlaug met with the chief executive of General Foods Corporation, James Fergusen. Norman Borlaug presented his long-standing desire for the establishment of a major prize for agriculture. The idea of a prize was met favorably by the Senior General Foods Management, but they expanded the scope of the prize to include all of the links of the food chain - from farm to table. General Foods Corporation organized a prize management structure and in 1986 announced the founding of the General Foods World Food Prize. This prize was funded solely by the General Foods Fund for the first four years of its existence and partially funded by the General Foods Fund and other contributors in the fifth year.\nSince 1990, the World Food Prize has been sponsored by businessman and philanthropist, John Ruan.\nLaureates are honored and officially awarded their prize in Des Moines, Iowa, in a televised award ceremony held in the House Chamber of the Iowa State Capitol. The Award Ceremony coincides with the Norman E. Borlaug International Symposium, known as the Borlaug Dialogue, which addresses an issue related to hunger and food security each year. Past symposia have focused on the promises and challenges presented by biofuels for global development, the dual challenges of malnutrition and obesity, water insecurity and its impact on development and stability in the Middle East, and \"The Green Revolution Redux: Can We Replicate the Single Greatest Period of Hunger Reduction in All Human History?\".\nIn 2008, the World Food Prize Foundation received a $5 million contribution from Monsanto to ensure the continuation of the annual World Food Prize International Symposium \"Borlaug Dialogue\". The funds supported a renewed fundraising campaign to transform the historic and former central Des Moines Public Library building into a public museum, the Hall of Laureates, to honor Norman Borlaug and the work of the World Food Prize laureates.\nThe 2013 Borlaug Dialogue was held 16\u201319 October 2013.\n\n\n== Funding ==\nThe prize was first funded by General Foods. Since 1990, the World Food Prize has been sponsored by the businessman John Ruan.\nPrimary sponsors of the World Food Prize include the Government of the State of Iowa, The Iowa Economic Development Authority, The John Ruan Foundation Trust, and the Rockefeller Foundation.  Other sponsors include over 100 charitable foundations, corporations and individuals, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Dupont Pioneer, the Howard G. Buffet Foundation, the John Deere Foundation, the Mathile Institute for the Advancement of Human Nutrition, Monsanto, Ruan Transportation Management Systems, Claudia and Paul Schickler, Kemin Industries, Land O'Lakes and others.\n\n\n== Laureates ==\nThe World Food Prize laureates are formally honored at the World Food Prize Laureate Award Ceremony annually on or near the World Food Day (16 October). The winners receive 250,000 United States dollars.\nThe announcement of the World Food Prize laureate or laureates is made in the late spring or early summer prior to her, his or their formal recognition in October.\n\n\n=== Hall of Laureates ===\nThe World Food Prize Hall of Laureates is located in the former Central Library on the Principal Riverwalk in downtown Des Moines, Iowa, which was constructed in the early 1900s as part of the City Beautiful movement.The World Food Prize Hall of Laureates honours the dreams of Norman Borlaug, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 and founder of the World Food Prize, and those of John Ruan, a Des Moines businessman. John Ruan had envisioned Des Moines as the \"food capital of the world\", and advocated for a World Trade Center to be built in the city in the 1980s. Such a center was never built, but Ruan's endowment of the World Food Prize in 1990 set in motion a goal to secure a home for such an organization. John Ruan III began the fundraising efforts with a donation of $5 million from his family in 2001. Ten years and $30 million later, the renovation was finished in time for the 25th anniversary of the World Food Prize. The original staircase to the east entrance had been removed in 1955 but was restored during the renovation. Also restored was the acroterium which had been destroyed in the mid-1930s.A portion of project funding was devoted to commissioning dozens of pieces of artwork by artists from Iowa and around the world to be displayed in the building. In addition, a new fountain and statues of John Ruan and Norman Borlaug can be found in the gardens on the west side of the building.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Borlaug-Ruan Internship ===\nThe Borlaug-Ruan International Internship provides high school students an opportunity for an eight-week hands-on experience, working with world-renowned scientists and policy makers at leading research centres around the world.The internship was founded in 1994 and has funded over one hundred Borlaug-Ruan interns who have travelled to Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Trinidad.\n\n\n=== Iowa Hunger Summit ===\nThe Iowa Hunger Summit has taken place during the week of the World Food Prize events since 2007. The event celebrates the role Iowans play in fighting hunger and advancing food security each year. The activities are open to the public and aim to encourage interaction among leaders in the community, government, schools, places of worship, and organizations.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe 2013 award to the seed biotechnology industry (Monsanto, Syngenta and European Federation of Biotechnology) has drawn criticism from opponents of genetically modified crops.\nIn 2014, three people were arrested who protested the World Food Prize in Des Moines.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of agriculture awards\nList of prizes known as the Nobel of a field\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nA.

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass.

The city has 45 miles (72 km) of trails. The first major park was Greenwood park. The park commissioners purchased the land on April 21, 1894.\nThe Principal Riverwalk is a riverwalk park district being constructed along the banks of the Des Moines River in the downtown. Primarily funded by the Principal Financial Group, the Riverwalk is a multi-year jointly funded project also funded by the city and state. Upon completion, it will feature a 1.2-mile (1.9 km) recreational trail connecting the east and west sides of downtown via two pedestrian bridges. A landscaped promenade along the street level is planned. The Riverwalk includes the downtown Brenton Skating Plaza, open from November through March.\nGray's Lake, part of the 167 acres (68 ha) of Gray's Lake Park, features a boat rental facility, fishing pier, floating boardwalks, and a park resource center. Located just south of the downtown, the centerpiece of the park is a lighted 1.9-mile (3.1 km) Kruidenier Trail, encircling it entirely.\nFrom downtown Des Moines primarily along the east bank of the Des Moines River, the Neil Smith and John Pat Dorrian Trails are 28.2-mile (45.4 km) paved recreational trails that connect Gray's Lake northward to the east shore of Saylorville Lake, Big Creek State Park, and the recreational trails of Ankeny including the High Trestle Trail.

          "Everywhere we looked, the Asian Gardens were in need of help. The gardens were overgrown with weeds and brush. The ponds some were dried out and others were filled. Either way they all needed cleaning as does the garden's iconic Asian building. The accent hardscapes were",

          "This tribute to former governor Ray offers some insight about the diverse population of Des Moines. I enjoyed the different aspects of this restful and beautiful spot.",
          "A great place to sit, relax and view while taking a stroll along Des Moines River walk. The area is serene and evocative of oriental beauty in a Midwestern setting.",
          "The first Saturday in January was sunny and had temperatures in the 50\u2019s. My S.O. and I enjoyed a walk along the river and stopped in to experience the Ray Asian Garden. I look forward to experiencing this in the warmer seasons when the water feature will be operating.",
          "I love running here every time I'm in Des Moines. Much to reflect upon while visiting. Spend a few or many moments. Free parking.",
          "This small garden is adjacent to one of the footpaths following the river. It is a good place to pause on a hike and spend a few contemplative moments.",
          "Walked through this so-called Asian garden yesterday. Faded paint, chipped railings, non-functioning pond and most suprising of all, there were no benches or other places to sit inside the pavilion or shade. This would be useful on a very hot day like it was yesterday. Don't",
          "Spent the day walking around downtown with a friend. We got cold beverages and walked through the garden. Neat plants and architecture.",
          "This was beautiful place to visit while in Des Moines Iowa! I was pleasantly shocked to see this Asian inspired garden in Iowa. But it adds such charm to the location. It\u2019s surrounded by a bridge and gorgeous apartments. It\u2019s a must see if you are traveling to Iowa",
          "Near to the down town and next to the river you can find a small garden with an Asian style. Is nice for take pictures",
          "This is a nice little park along the river in Des Moines. It has an Asian theme, not expected in the heart of Iowa. It's not very big, just a short walking path and a pagoda with a few small sculptures.",
          "Fantastic architecture in a beautiful setting. Sculptures are terrific. Peaceful and delightfully done.",
          "Quiet park setting for a very nice replication but not something I would have stopped at if it wasn't near Botanical Center.",
          "This is a neat little area to check out. It doesn't take more than 10 minutes to walk through. Considering this is less than 10 years old, I couldn't believe the amount of vandalism that has taken place. It is truly sad.",
          "If in the area, stop by! But it is not a must see. I was walking along the river and spotted this unique building. The Asian Garden makes for a few great photo opportunities. Although this attraction can be seen in a few short minutes, you can take your time here and just relax.",
          "This beautiful garden is small but very well maintained. For a short visit (we used it as a means to get out of the truck and stretch our legs after a long drive), it was a definite must-see.",
          "There really isn't anything to do here as far as a playground or anything of that sort. If you're looking to kill a few minutes it's worth stopping by. It really is just a short walkway through some pretty garden areas and then into the pagoda and then a little more garden",
          "its worth the walk along to river area to feel the tranquility of this area. You can take a very nice long walk along the river going all the way to Saylorville if you wanted too. Going the other way you are fairly close to downtown and the lighted bridges and the nearby Court",

          "I have an Asian garden at home and try to visit any we find while traveling. This is a very nice,peaceful area. Parking on the street if you can find any available spaces.",
          "Not worth visiting. Very small, walked through it in 45 seconds and it was not impressive or enjoyable.",
          "This very tiny pavilion is located on the river along a bike/walking path with plenty of free street parking. There is some vandalism, which is unfortunate, but it's very nice that Des Moines in general has diversity in it's city appeal.",
          "I expected to see bonsai and other Asian plants. Instead I found a small walkway with stone inscribed with Asian characters. No pond, which I also expected. There is a circle of stones with the various animal years (horse, rat, etc) but I don't recall seeing the years.",
          "This is a very pretty park nestled along the Des Moines river as you approach the Botanical Gardens. I have to agree with an earlier posting that it has been the victim of some minor (if there is such a thing) vandalism. I take issue with the earlier review that it is not",
          "I gave this a three-star rating because it is not well maintained. I do not blame the city but rather the inconsiderate degenerates who vandalized the place. I could tell that this was a nice place. It probably was a zen place to visit, a gem in the city. I felt bad for the",

          "The Asian Gardens are a welcome site along the river walk. We had a nice relaxing stroll looking at the structure and the gardens while listening to the river flow. A great way to unwind at the end of the day. There is also a walking bridge that spans the river located nearby",
          "This is still a nice little park, but it's obvious that funds need to be devoted to its upkeep. There are water features that are no longer functioning, a scummy pond, and broken lights. Access and parking is also limited. It wasn't worth the trip in its present condition.",
          "Gardens were very nice with a true Asian atmosphere. Unfortunately, for some reason the water features were not operating and the pond and fountains were completely dry. Disappointing.",
          "It is very short and sweet. And you can find out what Chinese figure you are. We had a two year old with us and she was excited to see everything",

          "Nice stop along an evening walk. Just wish people had more pride in keeping it nice. Dirty diaper left on the rocks by the river. City should fine these individuals. Other than that loved the shade and historic details. Doesn't take long to take in the sights.",
          "The Asian Gardens with the pagoda is located right on the river. There's now a beautiful pedestrian bridge that leads over the river and ends at another park, the Rotary Riverwalk Park. Both the Asian gardens and the park provide great views and make for a nice stop. There's no",

          "The Robert D. Ray Asian Gardens honor one of Iowa's most beloved governors as well as Des Moines' sister city in Asia. The walk along the river might not be like the Yang-see but you feel a sense of peace and as you look on the main building you are transported to Asia. The",
          "Well worth a quick stop, especially if you're in the area or on your way to the botanical garden. When we visited, even in early spring, this garden had a certain appeal to it. I imagine it's even better during warmer months.",
          "The small park is located along the Des Moines River between the Botanical Garden the Iowa Women of Achievement Pedestrian Bridge. The park is on the John Pat Dorrian Trail, part of a very large bike trail system that extends from the city to numerous surrounding counties.",
          "This was not the easiest place to find, in part because of some construction work nearby. I ended up finding it on the way to the Botanical Garden, which is just down the road on the same street. If you are wandering around Des Moines, I would recommend stopping by this peaceful",
          "This is truly a beautiful tranquil garden and structure. A beautiful place for a walk and also to sit and talk with a friend.",
          "We had some time to kill during the State Wrestling tournament, so we walked over to this park/garden area. We were pleasantly surprised by this little spot of tranquility in the middle of a very busy town! The park contains a small trail that guides you through and even in",
          "Good for a short stop, or head there on the Des Moines River trail from downtown.Beautiful and well maintained.",
          "This is a neat looking structure along the river. It is accompanied by some gardens and various landscaping. It is irritating to get down there and parking is limited. It is protected by Per-Mar security. I know that because their stupid signs are plastered everywhere.",
          "Very unique to see in the Midwest. Super confusing to figure out how to get to. Could be due to construction. No close by parking. Pretty with the river right by it.",
          "We visited this on our way from the Des Moines Botanical Garden to the bridge honoring women. The structure is most impressive but a bit isolated from other structures.",
          "This is a commerative pagoda-like shelter surrounded by Zen-style rock gardens by the Des Moines river. It's an interesting site if you're in the area, an a great place to stroll through, but not a main attraction unless you have a particular interest.",
          "I can't figure out what it is. For years it was surrounded by orange snow fence. We tried to go there to have a picnic and there was no seating or benches of any kind and no parking lot for it so we went to the Brenton Ice Rink.",
          "Right next to the river, these gardens are well designed and tranquil. Near the Botanical Center, it's certainly worth stopping as it is along the only road to the center. Des Moines is fortunate to have such gardens."

      "name": "Iowa State Capitol",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Iowa State Capitol, commonly called the Iowa Statehouse, is in Iowa's capital city, Des Moines. As the seat of the Iowa General Assembly, the building houses the Iowa Senate, Iowa House of Representatives, the Office of the Governor, and the Offices of the Attorney General, Auditor, Treasurer, and Secretary of State.  The building also includes a chamber for the Iowa Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Iowa Supreme Court building. The building was constructed between 1871 and 1886, and is the only five-domed capitol in the country.Located at East 9th Street and Grand Avenue, the Capitol is set atop a hill and offers a panoramic view of the city's downtown and the West Capitol Terrace.  Various monuments and memorials are to its sides and front, including the Soldiers and Sailors' Monument and the Lincoln and Tad statue.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nNot long after achieving statehood, Iowa recognized that the Capitol should be moved farther west than Iowa City, and the 1st General Assembly, in 1846, authorized a commission to select a location. In 1847, the town of Monroe City, in Jasper County, was selected as the new location of the capitol and platted out, but the 1848 Legislature decided not to move the capitol from Iowa City.  In 1854, the General Assembly decreed a location \u201cwithin two miles of the Raccoon fork of the Des Moines River.\u201d  The exact spot was chosen when Wilson Alexander Scott gave the state nine and one-half acres where the Capitol now stands. Final legislative approval for the construction of a permanent statehouse was given on April 8, 1870.\n\nA three-story brick building served as a temporary Capitol and was in use for 30 years, until destroyed by fires: in the meantime, the permanent Capitol was being planned and built.\nIn 1870, the General Assembly established a Capitol commission including local businessman and politician Peter A. Dey to employ an architect, choose a plan for a building (not to cost more than $1.5 million), and proceed with the work, but only by using funds available without increasing the tax rate.John C. Cochrane and Alfred H. Piquenard were designated as architects, and a cornerstone was laid on November 23, 1871.  However, much of the original stone deteriorated through waterlogging and severe weather, and had to be replaced. The cornerstone was relaid on September 29, 1873.Although the building could not be constructed for $1.5 million as planned, the Cochrane and Piquenard design was retained, and modifications were undertaken. Cochrane resigned in 1872, but Piquenard continued until his death in 1876. He was succeeded by two of his assistants, Mifflin E. Bell and W.F. Hackney.  Bell redesigned the dome so that it better fit the proportions of the building.  Hackney was the only architect who stayed on the project until the end.The capitol building was dedicated on January 17, 1884, and it was completed sometime in 1886.  The building commission made its final report on June 29, 1886, with a total cost of $2,873,294.59. The audit showed that only $3.77 was unaccounted for in the 15 years of construction.\n\n\n=== Fire and restoration ===\nOn January 4, 1904, a fire was started when the gas lights were being converted into electricity. The fire swept through the areas that housed the Supreme Court and Iowa House of Representatives.  A major restoration was performed and documented, with the addition of electrical lighting, elevators, and a telephone system.  Little information is available about who performed the actual restoration during these early years.  However, Elmer Garnsey created the ceiling artwork in the House Chamber.These earlier efforts to preserve the Capitol mostly dealt with maintaining and upgrading its interior.  It was not until 1965, when the dome was regilded, that legislators made significant investments in preserving the building's exterior.\nBy the early 1980s, the exterior of the Capitol had noticeably deteriorated. Sandstone pieces had begun falling from the building, prompting the installation of steel canopies at all entrances of the building to protect pedestrians. Decorative stone, whose deterioration had first been documented as early as the start of the 20th century, had also eroded.\nWork on the exterior restoration began in the spring of 1983 and was completed in nine phases.  Phase 9 work began in the spring of 1998, and the entire project was completed in the fall of 2001, at a cost of $41 million.\n\n\n=== International stature ===\n\nWhile its primary use is as the house of the legislative branch of Iowa government, the Capitol also functions as a living museum and state and international cultural facility. \nSince 1987, the World Food Prize laureate award ceremony is held annually in October in the House of Representatives chamber of the statehouse. The ceremony rivals that of the Nobel Prize, drawing over 800 people from more than 75 countries.  Each year, world-class performers take the stage to honor the World Food Prize Laureate.  Past performers have included Ray Charles, John Denver, and Noa to name a few. Following the ceremony, the celebration continues at a laureate award dinner held in the Capitol rotunda.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe architectural design of the Capitol, rectangular in form, with great windows and high ceilings, follows the traditional pattern of 19th-century planning for public buildings. A modified and refined Renaissance style gives the impression of strength and dignity combined with utility. The building measures 364 feet (111 m) from north to south and 247 feet (75 m) from east to west.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\nThe exterior of the building is entirely of stone with elaborate columns and handsomely designed cornices and capitals.  Iowa stone is the foundation for the many porticoes of the building.  The building is brick with limestone from Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio, and Illinois. The substructure is of dark Iowa stone topped by a heavy course of wari-colored granite cut from glacial boulders gathered from the Iowa prairie.  The superstructure, or main part of the building, is of bluff colored sandstone from quarries along the Mississippi River in Missouri.\nBoth front and back porticoes have pediments supported by six Corinthian columns each. The pediment over the front entrance discloses a fine piece of allegorical sculpture.  \nThe commanding feature is the central towering dome constructed of iron and brick and covered with tissue-paper thin sheets of pure 23-carat gold. There is a protective layer sealing the gold from the weather.  The gold leafing was replaced in 1964\u20131965 at a cost of $79,938. The most recent regilding of the dome was carried out from 1998 to 1999, at a cost of about $482,000.  The dome is surmounted by a lookout lantern that may be reached by long and winding stairs, and it terminates in a finial that is 275 feet (84 m) above the ground floor.  From its opening during 1884 until 1924, it was the tallest building in Des Moines, and likely the entire state.  The rotunda beneath the dome is 80 feet (24 m) in diameter.  Four smaller domes of simple design rise from the four corners of the Capitol.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe beauty, dignity, and arrangement of the interior become apparent as a visitor stands under the dome of the first floor.  Broad, lofty corridors extend west, north, and south.  Walls are highly decorated and the rooms and chambers of the capitol have a wide variety of Iowa wood as well as imported marble. Twenty-nine types of imported and domestic marble were used in the interior; and the wood used\u2014walnut, cherry, catalpa, butternut, and oak\u2014was nearly all from Iowa forests.The marble grand staircase between the second and third floors is to the east and is the focal point of the building. Suites opening from the south corridor are those of the Governor, Auditor of State, and Treasurer of State. The historical Supreme Court Chamber is to the north; the Secretary of State's suite is to the west. The grand staircase ascends to a landing and divides north and south to bring visitors to the floor above, where the House of Representatives is on the north, the Senate is on the south side, and the Law Library on the west. The Victorian-styled Law Library features four stories of balcony shelves surrounding a central atrium and is open to the public on weekdays.\nThe ground floor houses a cafeteria and administrative offices.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nAround the rotunda on the frieze above the columns is the famous quotation from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: \"This nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\nExtending the full width of the east wall over the staircase is the great mural painting Westward, an idealized representation of the coming of the people who made Iowa. The painting was completed shortly after the start of the 20th century. Edwin H. Blashfield, the artist, wrote of it: \"The main idea of the picture is a symbolical presentation of the Pioneers led by the spirits of Civilization and Enlightenment to the conquest by cultivation of the Great West.\"In the central rotunda, suspended beneath the ceiling on wires is a very large banner of the insignia of the Grand Army of the Republic, which between 1894 and 1953 had a room in the state capitol dedicated for their use.  They are the only non-state agency to have ever occupied space in the capitol.\n\n\n=== Displays ===\nThe battle flags carried by the Iowa regiments in various wars are preserved in niches on the main floor: Civil War, 1; Spanish\u2013American War, 13; World War I, 26. In the west hall is a plaque done by Nellie V. Walker in commemoration of the work of Iowa women in the fight for political equality and a memorial to those Iowans killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.Also in the west hall is a model of the battleship USS Iowa on loan from the U.S. Department of the Navy. The model is 18 feet 7 inches long and weighs about 1,350 pounds. It is a perfect scale model, \u200b1\u20444 inch equaling 1 foot. The Iowa was the lead ship of her class of battleship and the fourth in the United States Navy to be named in honor of the 29th state. It is also the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships, and was the only ship of her class to have served in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. On July 7, 2012, the retired Iowa opened to the public as a floating educational and naval museum at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, California.\nIn the south hall across from the Governor's office is a collection of porcelain dolls representing the 41 Iowa First Ladies in miniature replicas of their inaugural gowns. Where actual descriptions of the gowns could not be found, they are typical of the period.  As future First Ladies take their place, they, too, will be represented.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of state and territorial capitols in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of the Iowa State Capitol\nIowa General Assembly - Capitol Tour",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums.

The Iowa Energy, a D-League team, began play in 2007. They were bought by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2017 and were renamed the Iowa Wolves to reflect the new ownership. The Wild, the AHL affiliate of the National Hockey League's Minnesota Wild have played at Wells Fargo Arena since 2013; previously, the Iowa Chops played four seasons in Des Moines (known as the Iowa Stars for three of those seasons.)\nAdditionally, the Des Moines Buccaneers of the United States Hockey League play at Buccaneer Arena in suburban Urbandale.\nThe Vikings of Grand View University also compete in intercollegiate athletics in Des Moines. A member of the Heart of America Athletic Conference, within the NAIA, they field 21 varsity athletic teams. They were NAIA National Champions in football in 2013.\nThe Principal Charity Classic, a Champions Tour golf event, is held at Wakonda Club in late May or early June. The IMT Des Moines Marathon is held throughout the city each October.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\n\nDes Moines has 76 city parks and three golf courses, as well as three family aquatic centers, five community centers and three swimming pools. The city has 45 miles (72 km) of trails. The first major park was Greenwood park. The park commissioners purchased the land on April 21, 1894.\nThe Principal Riverwalk is a riverwalk park district being constructed along the banks of the Des Moines River in the downtown. Primarily funded by the Principal Financial Group, the Riverwalk is a multi-year jointly funded project also funded by the city and state. Upon completion, it will feature a 1.2-mile (1.9 km) recreational trail connecting the east and west sides of downtown via two pedestrian bridges. A landscaped promenade along the street level is planned. The Riverwalk includes the downtown Brenton Skating Plaza, open from November through March.\nGray's Lake, part of the 167 acres (68 ha) of Gray's Lake Park, features a boat rental facility, fishing pier, floating boardwalks, and a park resource center. Located just south of the downtown, the centerpiece of the park is a lighted 1.9-mile (3.1 km) Kruidenier Trail, encircling it entirely.\nFrom downtown Des Moines primarily along the east bank of the Des Moines River, the Neil Smith and John Pat Dorrian Trails are 28.2-mile (45.4 km) paved recreational trails that connect Gray's Lake northward to the east shore of Saylorville Lake, Big Creek State Park, and the recreational trails of Ankeny including the High Trestle Trail. These trails are near several recreational facilities including the Pete Crivaro Park, Principal Park, the Principal Riverwalk, the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden, Union Park and its Heritage Carousel of Des Moines, Birdland Park and the Birdland Marina/Boatramp on the Des Moines River, Riverview Park, McHenry Park, and River Drive Park. Although outside of Des Moines, Jester Park has 1,834 acres (742 ha) of land along the western shore of Saylorville Lake and can be reached from the Neil Smith Trail over the Saylorville Dam.\nJust west of Gray's Lake are the 1,500 acres (607 ha) of the Des Moines Water Works Park. The Water Works Park is along the banks of the Raccoon River immediately upstream from where the Raccoon River empties into the Des Moines River. The Des Moines Water Works Facility, which obtains the city's drinking water from the Raccoon River, is entirely within the Water Works Park. A bridge in the park crosses the Raccoon River. The Water Works Park recreational trails link to downtown Des Moines by travelling past Gray's Lake and back across the Raccoon River via either along the Meredith Trail near Principal Park, or along the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. The Water Works Park trails connect westward to Valley Junction and the recreational trails of the western suburbs: Windsor Heights, Urbandale, Clive, and Waukee. Also originating from Water Works Park, the Great Western Trail is an 18-mile (29 km) journey southward from Des Moines to Martensdale through the Willow Creek Golf Course, Orilla, and Cumming. Often, the location for summer music festivals and concerts, Water Works Park was the overnight campground for thousands of bicyclists on Tuesday, July 23, 2013, during RAGBRAI XLI.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nThe Greater Des Moines Sister City Commission, with members from the City of Des Moines and the suburbs of Cumming, Norwalk, Windsor Heights, Johnston, and Ankeny, maintains sister city relationships with five world communities:\n \u2013 Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan (August 16, 1958)\n \u2013 Saint-\u00c9tienne, Loire, France (May 29, 1985)\n \u2013 Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (August 8, 1985)\n \u2013 Stavropol, Russia (July 27, 1992)\n \u2013 Pristina, Kosovo (November 29, 2018) (Kosovo also opened Consulate in downtown Des Moines in 2015) List of diplomatic missions of Kosovo\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people from Des Moines, Iowa\nMoingona\nDes Moines Police Department\nDes Moines-class cruiser\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nFriedericks, William B.

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage.

        "wiki": "The Raccoon River is a 30.8-mile-long (49.6 km) tributary of the Des Moines River in central Iowa in the United States.  As measured using the longest of its three forks, its length increases to 226 miles (364 km). Via the Des Moines River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River. The river runs through an intensely cultivated area of croplands and livestock farming, receiving Tile drainage from slow-draining rich natural bottomland.\nThe Des Moines metropolitan area has been obtaining its drinking water from the Raccoon River just before it empties into the Des Moines River through water utilities since the 19th century. During the Great Flood of 1993, the Raccoon River flooded the water treatment facility of Des Moines, shutting off the city's supply of drinking water.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Racoon River was first documented on the 1814 map by Lewis and Clark, though the USGS references the name to a later map from 1843 named Hydrological Basin of the Upper Mississippi River based on field measurements by Joseph N. Nicollet during his Midwestern expeditions in the 1830s.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Raccoon River is a 30.8-mile-long (49.6 km) tributary of the Des Moines River in central Iowa in the United States. It flows for much of its length as three streams and when measured using the longest of its three forks, its length increases to 226 miles (364 km).The river runs through an intensely cultivated area of croplands mostly of corn and soy and livestock farming, where slow-draining rich natural bottomlands have been tiled to drain them for agricultural cultivation.\nThe North Raccoon River is, by far, the longest of the three, at 196 miles (315 km). It rises north of Marathon in northeastern Buena Vista County and initially flows southwardly into Sac County, where it turns southeastward for the remainder of its course through Calhoun, Carroll, Greene and Dallas counties.  It passes the towns of Sac City, Jefferson, Perry and Adel.  The Adel Island dam in Adel is the only dam along its course.\nThe Middle Raccoon River, 92 miles (148 km) long, rises in northwestern Carroll County and flows generally southeastwardly through Guthrie and Dallas counties, past Carroll, Coon Rapids, Springbrook State Park, Panora, Linden, and Redfield.  The three dams located along its course are the Lake Panorama dam and the Lennon Mill dam at Panora, and the Redfield dam at Redfield.  Even though the Lake Panorama dam, completed in 1970, was built for recreational purposes only, it has provided some additional benefits by controlling flooding along the Middle Raccoon River.  The Middle Raccoon River flows into the South Raccoon River about 1 mile (1.6 km) south of Redfield.\nThe South Raccoon River, about 72 miles (116 km) long, rises in northeastern Audubon County and flows generally southeastwardly through Guthrie and Dallas counties, past the town of Guthrie Center.  South of Redfield, after the Middle Raccoon River flows into the South Raccoon River, a flow gauge operated jointly by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Rock Island District), the United States Geological Survey (Iowa District), and the Iowa Department of Transportation provides data about potential flooding threats.The north and south forks join in Dallas County just west of Van Meter, and the Raccoon River flows generally eastward into Polk County, past Walnut Woods State Park and West Des Moines. It joins the Des Moines River just south of downtown Des Moines and is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.\n\n\n== Drinking water use ==\nBoth the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers have been providing drinking water for the Des Moines metropolitan area through water utilities since the 19th century. During the Great Flood of 1993, the Raccoon River flooded the water treatment facility of Des Moines, shutting off the city's drinking water supply.\n\n\n=== Agricultural pollution ===\nSpring thaws, as in the spring of 2013, and rainy spells after drought wash nitrate from fertilizer into the river. On November 20, 2014 nitrates spiked at 13.7 parts per million (ppm), making the water unsafe for pregnant women and infants. (The US Environmental Protection Agency requires officials to inform the public about safety risks at 10 ppm.) At the time, these were the highest readings in the nation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Iowa rivers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nColumbia Gazetteer of North America entry\nDeLorme (1998).

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) quite often. Snowfall averages 35.3 inches (90 cm) per season, and annual precipitation averages 36.0 inches (914 mm), with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city.

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area.

Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C).

          "Of course, the first thing I noticed was the $10 parking, whether you are parked by the door or four lots away.  They are rather short on handicap parking or if you arrive when the Full sign is up and there are handicap spots available, you \u2026",

Depending on the promotion food can be reasonable to overpriced. Plan on 9.50 a beer. We catch about 10 games a year. The family 4 pack is the way to go.",

          "First time at the park was great.  I was sitting in section 11 and had a great view of the whole park.  I'm confident that no matter where you are sitting you will be able to have a great view.  Parking was easy and I was directed to where there were open spaces so I did not have to drive around looking for a spot.",

You can go cheap and find street parking and general admission tickets, or spring for nicer seats and parking in the inner lots - so there are some choices. The location of the stadium is in the heart of Des Moines. Worth a visit!",

          "Attended many, many games when it was Sec Taylor Stadium.. Thanks to the Cubs and the City of Des Moines to see the importance of this facility for the added enjoyment of the fans and the economic benefits to the city it self",
          "While the reason for the gathering was sadly based (funeral for my father), the post funeral gathering was held at the ballpark clubhouse, as it was one of his favorite locations. The folk there were exceedingly gracious, and the venue was phenomenal. It was January, and thus",

          "I was lucky enough to see a double header and enjoyed every minute of it. The seats are roomier than i expected and there is even a spot for your drink. I was able to bring a water bottle in with me but they obviously sell refreshments and even souvenirs which surprised me! If",
          "Principal Park had such a fun atmosphere. We went on bring your dog to the park night and it was a ton of fun. The staff at the stadium were all very helpful and friendly and our group had a ton of fun! A must see in Des Moines.",
          "What a gem! This minor league park was intimate and allowed great seats for all. We were 4th row up just past 1st base, for $14/ticket. Wow! It was super fun!",
          "My family & I go multiple times a summer. Always have fun. Not a bad seat in the house, depending on how much you want to spend. If you are going on a fireworks night or a night that is going to be crowded, i'd spend the extra money and go with reserved seats. Park is always",
          "Our family loves to spend time at baseball games. We have spent lots of time here are always have a good time. Many of the Cubs players are willing to stay after the game to sign autographs and take pictures with our kids. The merchandise store has a great selection of both Iowa",
          "Wow, what a great park and atmosphere. We were supposed to head to Minneapolis for a Big League game, but fell in love with Des Moines and the Iowa Cubs!!! Great seats, great fans, and fun fireworks. Only complaint is that a lot of the food shut down pretty early!!!",
          "Principal Park is fantastic. Besides the stunning evening views of the Des Moines skyline beyond the outfield walls and the family-friendly atmosphere, getting to watch the top prospects (and the Chicago Cubs stars sent down to rehab) of the Lovable Losers is enjoyable. While",
          "We spent the evening at an Iowa Cubs game while visiting famiy in Iowa. Lots of concessions and variety. All seats are close to the field being AAA. Parking was tight so get there early if driving as it gets congested with rivers blocking two sides of the stadium. I had to drop",
          "What a nice experience my wife and I enjoyed. We went to two games over the holiday weekend and enjoyed Principal Park as well as the Iowa Cubs. Game 1 we sat 1 row behind the visitor's dugout so as close to the field as we could be without being on the turf. Game 2 we up a bit",
          "The Iowa Cubs do a great job for the fans who come to Principal Park. The staff is very good at directing and letting people park. Tailgating is allowed here it appears so that is always a good thing for fans. The ball park itself is very well done. Concessions are aplenty",
          "Good place, prices for games. Though it is warm on the 1st base side with the sun blaring down on you. Good activity for the family.",
          "WOW, the sun really bears down the 1st base stands during a day game, so bring your sunglasses, sunscreen and water bottle, which you can fill at coolers along the procession. Take a break and visit the fountain in right field!",
          "We attended a Friday night game where the Iowa Cubs played Omaha. The stadium was packed and full of anxious fans for the game to start, and they stayed energized the entire game. The park is set up quite nicely, although the parking situation could be better; get there at",

          "Great place to go for a day game or a night game. Easy access to everything in the park and a good variety of food for kids and adults. Highly recommend a night game with fireworks!",
          "We were here on a cold and damp night. Once we got a beer and found our seats, we barely moved. It looked like there were some micro brews on the lower lever concourse and the food smelled good. The price was right as well. Oh, and the cubs won. I definitely need to return when",
          "Have gone several different times. Always have great service in the food areas great ball park foods. Kind people there for when you get lost to assist you in finding your way. Area to Cool off if needed and want to get a little or a lot wet by the fountains. The ball players",

          "It's alwaya a joy going to the ballpark with my daughters. The tickets are inexpensive, the baseball is AAA, and there are always friends in the stands. Food prices are what you'd expect, which is always on the high side at ballparks, but not as outrageous as some. I always",
          "We enjoyed ourselfs game want professional big league but for the price a real bargin. 6 of us 3 couples and to the best of what I seen everyone got a buzz and enjoyed the game. Mostly the company. The only thing I strongly recommend is find a good parking spot.",
          "I love having a AAA team in Des Moines. It's a great ballpark and you get to see potentially major league players up close for not a huge cost. The park has a nice variety of stadium foods and drinks, is clean and welcoming. Parking is a bit of a challenge, but doable. We go",
          "We especially love the nights with the fireworks after the game! Always have a fun time at the games!",
          "Only attended for the beer and snacks and to be with friends, other than that, nothing to brag about. 47 minutes of actual play time, 3 hours of mound talk and butt patting!",
          "Go several times every year and have been for 35 years. Really nice park with some family friendly features. Water fountain for kids to splash around on a hot day, picnic tables to make it easier to eat with kids. Of course, food and drinks are too expensive, quality is sub",

          "I go to as many Iowa Cubs baseball games as possible. There are fireworks after the games on some nights. You can look out over centerfield and see the lighted State Capitol and the flowing Des Moines River. The Principal Park has been remodeled and it has great seating. The",
          "Best place to see Chicago Cubs in rehab or waiting for the call to the big show. Great ballpark and Clark makes his rounds during the game to all parts of the game. Tickets are great prices.",

          "Had a Fabulous first experience at Principle park on Friday 9-2! Easy parking and drop off, easy and fast lines to get in. This is a well designed baseball park that gives fans an intimate experience, wherever your seat is located. Wonderful Fireworks after the game was a bonus,",
          "As with a lot of minor league parks, it's a fun time. You can get a lot closer to the action for a lot less money. Plus, the park is very close to downtown - we walked there along the river trail, so no need for a car.",
          "A great ballpark to see a game. I honestly don't think there is a bad seat in the house. One of the great things to be able to do is go on line to the Iowa Cubs site, select your seat and print your ticket. Want an aisle seat, get it on line. Want to sit higher, get it on line.",
          "Well, the park is nice seating is great not a bad seat. The parking is fair and tight get there early. The food is the negative. Eat before you go plenty of great places around the park. The park food is not real good or varied and expensive. The food was a disappointment to us",
          "As a Cubs fan, I love the idea of watching the I-Cubs play. Unfortunately, if you don't get here early, the traffic and parking can be a nightmare especially if there is a marquee player in the game. Other venues in the state are more conducive to that baseball experience.",
          "Big Chicago Cubs fans so we decided to go see the Iowa Cubs, very nice stadium and the workers were very friendly.",
          "Visited for boys state tournament Game. Nice park. Expensive parking. Food was pricy which I expect at a ballpark, but also terrible. Brat was very tiny, size of a hotdog and cold. Popcorn tasted stale. I would have given a 5 star had the food not been so bad for the money. Park",
          "I love going to ball games here and they have special events throughout the summer. The fireworks for the 4th of July go on all week that there is a game. The food and beverages are very good and not over priced.",

          "This is a great place to watch a ball game. The stadium is about as nice as they come in the minor leagues. We took our 13 year old baseball team, and purchased group tickets. We had great seats, with everyone sitting together for $7 per ticket. The concession food is pretty",
          "We wanted to go to an I-Cubs game and decided the 4th of July would be perfect since we could incorporate a game and the fireworks. The game was good, the fireworks great. I would caution to choose your seats wisely if you have long legs or someone of \"good\" size in your",
          "For a small market city like Des Moines Principal Park is an excellent stadium. It is very nice. I've played there (when in high school) and have watched many games there, both high school an I-Cubs, and never been disappointed. Everything you need is easy to get to and there",

          "Went to see the Iowa Cubs play on the 4th of July. I wasn't too sure if our seats would be great just by looking at the screen on my computer when purchasing our tickets but they were great! From Section 16, row 3 you could see everything on the field. My only complaint is",
          "If you like hot dogs, pizza or tenderloins, this is the place to go. If you like baseball, Principal Park is one of the best AAA parks in the Midwest. If your a Cub fan, you need season tickets.",

          "Nice ballpark but parking is kind of a hassle. We went on a Saturday night so it was crowded. Food a pricey considering it is Des Moines. Definitely would go again.",
          "I went to 2 games in 2 days. The first was an afternoon came that started at 12:08 and broke a cardinal rule of mine i.e. never sit or stand in the sun if you can help it. The game went into extra innings and lasted 4 + hours. Very good view of the field and an overall good",

          "A nice relaxing night at the ballpark after a hard day of work is just what the doctor ordered. Beer is expensive but that's expected. Many food options, but I like the brat station just inside the main entrance. A perfect backdrop of the capital and an absolutely beautiful",
          "About 15 of us enjoyed a day at the ball park on our sister. She was gracious enough to even provide food. The game and seats were great. The food was mediocre at best and really expensive. We had a good time there but would have chosen just to eat at the various places in",

          "We basically only went on the new Principal River Walk which was very beautiful. It was difficult to maneuver some - not being able to tell how to get down to the riverwalk, plus there were \"dead ends\" and had to figure out how to get to other parts of the walk. Unfortunately",

        "wiki": "West Des Moines is a city in Polk, Dallas, and Warren counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. Most of the city is in Polk County, with slivers extending into Dallas and Warren counties.\nAs of the 2010 census the city population was 56,609, with the United States Census Bureau estimating a population of 67,899 in 2019. West Des Moines is the second-largest city in the Des Moines metropolitan area and the sixth-largest city in Iowa. It ranked 94th in Money magazine's list of the \"100 Best Places to Live and Launch\" in 2008, 77th and 57th on the 100 Best Places to Live in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and 18th on the Hipster Cities of 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe West Des Moines area used to be home to the Sac and Fox tribes. Near the stroke of midnight on October 11, 1845 a gunshot was fired by a cattle farmer, James Cunningham Jordan (1813\u20131893) to declare that the area was open for Anglo-European settlement. His residence, the Jordan House, has been restored and is now home to the West Des Moines Historical Society. The Jordan House was a stop on the Underground Railroad, and abolitionist John Brown stayed on Jordan property multiple time, at least once while escorting a group of freedom seeking slaves to Canada. In West Des Moines' early years, the town was a trading and shipping junction. West Des Moines incorporated as the city of Valley Junction on October 9, 1893.\nIn its early days Valley Junction was home to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's switching facilities and repair shops due to its location at the junction of several railroad lines. The Rock Island's facilities moved out of Valley Junction and back into Des Moines in 1936.\nThe speed limit of ten miles (16 km) an hour had existed in Valley Junction since 1911 for all automobiles. But in 1915 an Englishman named Jack Prince built a one-mile (1.6 km) oval race track, designed to let race cars break that speed limit ten times over. The wooden track was made of 980,000 feet (300,000 m) of 2x4's laid on edge. It was one of 24 such tracks nationwide; with seating for over 10,000 people. On August 7, 1915, the eyes of the auto world were on Valley Junction in anticipation of the fastest 300-mile (480 km) auto race in history. Ralph DePalma, winner of the Indianapolis 500 that year, was one of at least a dozen drivers vying for the $10,000 purse. Before a crowd of 7,000 people, a tire blew, lunging Joe Cooper's car over the rail. Cooper was killed and his mechanic was injured. Later while rounding a curb, a wheel of Billy Chandler's Duesenberg failed, cartwheeling the car into the infield and fatally injuring his mechanic, Maurice Keeler. Chandler was seriously injured. Smiling Ralph Mulford won the race with DePalma a close 2nd. This baptism by blood left a bad taste in the mouth of the locals, and the track was closed two years later. The wood was salvaged and then used to construct buildings in Valley Junction.\nThe serious dilemma of school overcrowding was partially addressed in 1916. The bond issue to build a new high school for $50,000 was approved by a 2 to 1 vote. The similar new grade school issue was defeated soundly. Building commenced and by September of the following year, the doors of the new Valley High School were opened at 8th and Hillside. As a part of schoolboard policy, only first class college-educated teachers were hired. By 1919, the rooms of the new high school were filled. A new junior high school was proposed, approved, and completed by the fall of 1923.\nThe new school was the only bright spot in the otherwise uncertain dreary years of 1922 and 1923. The foundations of the city were shaken by a 22-month-machinist strike at the Rock Island shops. Starting 1922-07-01, 600 workers were idled. The railroad company reacted by bringing replacement workers into town to break the strike. The replacements were mostly Mexican and African-American laborers brought up from Oklahoma by R. C. Hyde, the master mechanic at the shops. For their own protection they lived in boxcars and tiny houses in an area south of Railroad Avenue and west of the main rail yards. The area was dubbed \"Hyde Park\" by the strikers. The resulting hardships suffered by the idled workers led the most desperate to choose between breaking the strike or letting their family starve. It was a time which pitted neighbor against neighbor, tearing at the fabric of the community. Two men shot themselves in desperation before the strike ended.\nAlthough the 1920s was the era of prohibition for the rest of the country, Valley Junction had officially become a dry town in 1915. The '20s were not all doom and gloom for Valley Junction. The businessmen of the community dress in drag for a play called \"The Womenless Wedding\". Simple joys of small town life were reflected in the faces of the children: having a part in the school play, flying the first kite, dressing up for the May Day pageant, or riding in the Fourth of July Parade. The older kids enjoyed the chance to take the trolley to Des Moines for an afternoon of shopping and maybe lunch along the river. The notion of the mobile society was embraced by the youth. A joy ride in a fast jalopy to Greenwood Park for a game of tennis, or off to the country for a picnic mirrored the infatuation America had for the car. The wealthier, older, and more established were not left out either. By purchasing land from the Ashworth family farm, the Des Moines Golf and Country Club left Des Moines in 1923 for a more picturesque setting along the White Pole Road auto trail at 8th Street allowing the High Society of Des Moines a relaxing and rather pleasant drive away from the hussle and bussle of the city for a day of golf in the Valley.  By the close of the decade, however, the picnic was over. The Depression was especially hard for the workers of Valley Junction because the railroads had finished pulling out by 1936, and the Keystone Coal Factory had to close because of flooding in the tunnels.\nBy 1937, only two trains stopped daily; the sagging business climate needed a boost. Members of the commercial club believed the only way to attract new industry would be to change the name of the city. They thought the name \"Valley Junction\" conveyed the image of an old-fashioned and backwards town to prospective employers and residents. The name of \"West Des Moines\" would give it the respectability and prestige the town desperately needed. There was a precedent by way of an editorial in the Valley Junction Express in 1905 that suggested dropping \"Junction\" from the name, but nothing came of it. The opposition feared the change to West Des Moines would cause property owners to be taxed the same as Des Moines. It was also declared as a step toward annexation by Des Moines. A third and final election was held on December 7, 1937.\n\nOn January 1, 1938, the name \"Valley Junction\" was relegated to the past, and the new city of West Des Moines took the first steps to a new identity. Helping to establish this new identity, the most identifiable trait was the suspension of all property taxes between 1936 and 1938. This was due to the profits of the water department. Today the original business district of West Des Moines has been preserved as Historic Valley Junction. It features many locally owned specialty shops and restaurants as well as a weekly farmers' market.\nThough the name was changed, the community's commitment to education was bolstered by funds from the Public Works Administration. Despite the Depression, a new elementary school and the Old Valley Football Stadium were built and dedicated on May 24, 1939, at 8th and Hillside. The venerable Lincoln School was razed in 1938 to make way for the new building. Longfellow was retired in 1939 and then sold in 1940 for $1000. In 1955, West Des Moines Elementary School at Walnut and 6th was renamed \"Nellie Phenix Elementary\" in honor of the former principal.  The late 1930s were very good years in the school's athletic teams, producing memorable names: True, Gavin, Swink, and Sherbo. Charles Swink was a multi-record holder in track and field. His record at the Drake Relays stood for twenty years.\nAn overgrown concrete eyesore on Ashworth Road soon became the musical mecca for the surrounding area on June 6, 1939, when Tom Archer opened the Val Air Ballroom. The site was originally the location of the stillborn Wilson Rubber company factory. Intended to bolster World War I tire production, the end of the war in 1918 left only a large concrete slab. Patrons of the Val Air could dance under a canopy of stars to the melodious sounds of Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and other big bands. The war years brought new vitality to the community without a cost.\nThen and now, flooding frequently dampens, but has not broken the residents' spirits. Unpredictable waters of the Raccoon River and Walnut Creek have often exceeded their banks due to large amounts of rain in the summer and snowmelt in the spring, filling the streets and damaging homes and businesses.\nIn 1950 West Des Moines had a population of 5,615, but the city grew as many new housing subdivisions were built. West Des Moines annexed the neighboring community of Clover Hills in 1950, the town of Ashawa, a former Rock Island railroad stop, in 1957, and the town of Commerce, along the Raccoon River, in 1960. City government also grew, and when the venerable city hall could not keep up with the city's expansion, the city opened a new municipal building in 1954. With the influx of students, the school district's ever-expanding borders continually compromised classroom capacity. Children attended school in former homes near Phenix, with classes in hallways and living rooms. Space was even rented from the new Catholic grade school. In 1959 alone, 150\u2013200 new homes were built, adding to the population's growth. The construction of Interstate 35, Interstate 80, and Interstate 235 in the 1960s brought more people and businesses to West Des Moines. This construction also caused the Des Moines Golf and Country Club to sell its location along Ashworth Road and 8th Street and then move to its current location in Dallas County. In 1966, Dowling Catholic High School/St. Joseph Educational Center purchased 55-acre (22 ha) from the Des Moines Golf and Country Club and, subsequently, moved from Des Moines and opened at its current location, 1400 Buffalo Road, in the fall of 1972. Several retail and office complexes opened along the I-235 corridor after the freeway's completion, including Valley West Mall, which opened in 1975. West Des Moines' population jumped from 11,964 in 1960 to 31,702 in 1990.\nWest Des Moines expanded into Dallas County during the 1990s and 2000s, once again placing the premier golf courses of the Des Moines Golf and Country Club in its city limits and punctuated by the opening of one of the best golf courses in Iowa at the Glen Oaks Country Club along with the West Glen Town Center and the largest in the state of Iowa, Jordan Creek Town Center and shopping mall in 2004. Major commercial construction is underway around the area, including the opening of many additional hotels, shopping centers, and office buildings, including a new Wells Fargo corporate campus. In 2007 construction started on the Village of Ponderosa, an urban-inspired and pedestrian friendly community. In 2005 West Des Moines annexed land in Warren County for the first time. Seeing the land to the south of Des Moines as extremely valuable, especially with the completion of a major \"South-Belt Freeway\" system, the cities of Norwalk and West Des Moines are actively competing for land in the northern part of Warren County. From 1990 to 2015, West Des Moines is the fastest growing city in Iowa according to land mass.\nDuring the 1990s a new city/school campus opened near the intersection of South 35th Street and Mills Civic Parkway. West Des Moines' new police station opened in April 1992. This was followed by the opening of a new public library in 1996; the library served as temporary home for West Des Moines' city hall until a new building was dedicated in late 2002. The campus also features a new stadium for Valley High School that also opened in 2002. On the same property, the West Des Moines School district operates Valley Southwoods, a freshman high school with over 600 students that opened in 1996. Turning the West Des Moines Community Schools into a two high school district was not acceptable. In 2004, August Hillside Elementary opened on the former site of Hillside Junior High and Old Valley Stadium, which was demolished in 2001. In 2012, Clegg Park Elementary was renovated and opened as the new Walnut Creek Campus which is the district's alternative high school. Major renovation and additions were completed at Valley High in 2007 and again in 2015.\n\n\n== Government ==\nWest Des Moines uses the mayor-council form of government with a city manager appointed by the city council. The council consists of the mayor, two at-large members, and three members from each of the city's three wards. The mayor and all council members serve four-year terms. Rick Messerschmidt served as the interim mayor of the city following former mayor Eugene Meyer's resignation in January 2007; On April 17 Steve Gaer was elected mayor during a special election. Tom Hadden is the city manager of West Des Moines.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nWest Des Moines is located at 41\u00b034\u203225\u2033N 93\u00b045\u20321\u2033W (41.573739, \u221293.750359). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 39.48 square miles (102.25 km2), of which 38.59 square miles (99.95 km2) is land and 0.89 square miles (2.31 km2) is water. West Des Moines' location in the Raccoon River valley has left parts of the city, particularly the Valley Junction area, prone to flooding. After the Great Flood of 1993, a floodwall was constructed along Walnut Creek (near the boundary with Des Moines) to protect that area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWest Des Moines has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa).\n\n\n=== Street numbering ===\nWhile nearby Clive, Urbandale, and Windsor Heights use the same street numbers for north-south streets that Des Moines uses, West Des Moines uses its own street numbering system. Thus, 86th Street in Clive and Urbandale becomes 22nd Street in West Des Moines. Iowa Highway 28, which forms most of the boundary between Des Moines and West Des Moines, is 63rd Street in Des Moines but 1st Street in West Des Moines. Many of the east-west streets share the same name with Des Moines, although the numbering of these east-west streets starts over in West Des Moines.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe median income for a household in the city was $54,139, and the median income for a family was $70,600 (in a 2008 estimate, these figures had risen to $61,256 and $83,800 respectively, in 2008 inflation-adjusted dollars). Males had a median income of $45,185 versus $31,555 for females.

          "An amazing venue for children and adults alike! I know my level of anticipation equals the 5 grandkids 6-11 (I'm early 70's); have attended four years straight. We usually stay around two hours though could easily double that. Attending presentations are a highlight though",
          "Very nice place and lots of activities. After visiting with my teen, we realized she enjoyed it much more when she was younger. The new music area was enjoyable.",

          "We arrived at the Museum 15 minutes after they opened. The young man at the entrance was very polite and patient with us. Our children, ages 14, 10 and 5 enjoyed the exhibits and shows very much. Andrea did a wonderful job with her show about the digestive system and with",
          "I spent a full Saturday here with four grandchildren aged 3 to 9. We were not in a hurry, so we enjoyed every room and exhibit for as long as the kids wanted. It was very interactive and interesting for them. Just large enough to have plenty of variety. We broke up the day",

          "I loved going here when I was a kid I love going their now. We have not been there since I was 11. I think they need more older kid activities to allow more aged families enjoy it to. The year I went s not on here so I picked the only one close enough. I'm 14 now to give you a",
          "There were all ages for children to delight in. I went with the 10 year old with the electrical things. The 1 and 3 year old had an area of their own. It is well worth it to see!!!",
          "We started with the IMAX Beautiful Planet show which was exciting and informative. Headed to the hands on tool area and then Legos. After to the activity area which included building Lego race cars with a 4 car racetrack, building a rocket and a dam to control the flow of water.",

          "The Science Center offers so many interesting things to do for children/families. There are many inter-active features and learning opportunities that are most interesting and educational. The IMAX theater also offers a fun experience no matter what the movie playing at the",
          "This is a SMALL science center. If you've never visited before it will be fun for about two hours at most. We have season passes and stuff never changes. There is maybe one or two floating exhibits but they are fare and few between. We just went this past weekend and there",
          "We went here with our son and daughter-in-law and 18-month-old granddaughter and had a wonderful time! There was plenty for our toddler to do and see. This would be a great place to visit with children of all ages, but would probably appeal most to pre-teens. We loved the",
          "Being a grown man that loves IMAX I was not disappointed at all. We went to go see Born to be Wild and took our 6 year old daughter. It was great and actually kept her attention which is not easy to do. The facilities were very clean and the theater is awesome.",
          "This is not a very big science museum. It is ok for small children, but it does not have very much attractions, the ones thy do have are small.",
          "My boys are 4 & 6, they had a fabulous time at the Science Center of Iowa! They learned new things too. They have a few shows during the day, we saw the fire show.....it was very neat and educational!! The boys are still talking about when we go back they are going to build a",
          "Really enjoyed our time at the SCI. Various attractions and some added \"shows\" we could see. We went to one called \"Fireworks\" and learned about fire and combustion which our girls really enjoyed. Lots of hands on opportunities for the kids and adults alike. Visited the Dome",
          "This place more than rocked! From the globe IMAX to the green weather screen to the geometry room, it was great fun for hours! Highly recommend it. It was worth the money.",
          "SCI has many activities to entertain everyone for ages. There are live shows with a science theme, great IMax movies, and many hands-on activities that delight everyone who walks through the door. The ball wall, egg drop, and paper rockets are favorites of everyone. The only",
          "There are a lot of fascinating exhibits at the DSM Science Center. Many are hands on and the kids don't even realize they're doing engineering. Special exhibits can be great also.",
          "I'll admit that I have been here for a while. But I know family that has and this is a great place to go.",
          "So much more space and the Foucault pendulum is still there. I'm not sure when it moved to the new, much larger location, but so glad they moved. My 3 and 5 year olds had a blast in various parts. I will definitely go back!",
          "We visited on our way through Iowa using our reciprocal program. They charge you extra if you have more than 2 children! We have visited 20 museums with the program and not had this happen before! I paid it thinking this must be a very good museum and must be worth it! It was",
          "One of the greatest things that is the use and acknowledgment of the reciprocity program. There is an entire network all over the US where you can go and enjoy what these places have to offer for free or a discounted price. Des Moines Science Center did not disappoint by",
          "We drove from Texas to visit my dad over spring break. Turns out our spring break was a week earlier than Iowa, which made it the perfect time to visit the Science Center! We had such a lovely afternoon...with minimal crowds, the kids were able to do all of the hands-on",
          "SCI has many activities to entertain your family for 4 or more hours. There are live shows with a science theme, great IMax offerings, and many hands-on activities that delight kids of all ages. The ball wall, egg drop, and paper rockets were favorites of the 6 year-old that",
          "Clean & good food The Imax dome theatre is wonderful! Best way to watch a movie. Worth every pennies!",
          "Interactive exhibits for all ages make the Science Center of Iowa a great place to spend a chilly afternoon, especially if entertaining school age children.",
          "We \"only\" had 3 hours to spend here and that wasn't nearly long enough....especially for a first visit. This is a great space with a lot of room. I brought my teenager and my two younger sons and they all had stuff to keep them busy. The little kids got a lot more out of it",
          "There are so many interesting things to see and do one can't get bored even young children. The IMAX is a great experience also.",
          "Really fun place to take the family there is something for every age person! The theater is something worth going to! Go back every couple of months as it is always changing.",
          "I hoped the science center would be similar to the science museum in Chicago (geared toward everyone of all ages), but it wasn't. However, my husband and I had a nice time just walking around and playing with some of exhibits. The kids we encountered there seemed to have a good",
          "This particular Science center has one of the better IMAX theaters that I've been to. It also has a ton of seating but I would strongly recommend you get there early to find the seat you would prefer. As for the Science Center itself, I have always been impressed with the ever",
          "We were there for a wedding reception and it was very nice. It was great the young people and children could entertain themselves with all of the fun stuff at the center",
          "My husband had not seen Star Wars yet so we thought we would spend the extra money and go to IMAX. If you buy your tickets on line make sure to stop off at the desk and get your ticket/receipt as they have no way to give you a ticket when you go into the theater. We went early",
          "What a great place to see Star Wars the only problem was the stopped the film in the very beginning probably to let the rest of the people get seated.",
          "I saw Star Wars at the IMAX there. We sat in the front row. You could only see the characters necks and part of their chin from there. Being a 4 year Iraq war disabled vet who walks with a cane I would have liked to walk down the 4 steps to get out when the show was over.",
          "My kids are 8 and 7, both of them loved this place. The staff was friendly and it provided a great place to learn things about how things work.",
          "This is a nice Science Center/Children's Museum. I took my 5 yr old son there Friday night and the place was near empty. He talked me into taking him back on Saturday and it was packed because of a lego building contest going on. Still a very nice visit and large/open enough",
          "visted the Center for the 4th or 5th time and still find it to be a great time and good value. The Center brings in new exhibits on a regular basis and maintain their long running exhibits. I always see families enjoying themselves and packaged with other close attractions you",
          "Love love love this place, great place to take the kids for a day full of fun and learning. New stuff to do every time",
          "Our family found the Science Center of Iowa worth the trip. We've been to a large number of science museums and children's museums and this was certainly above average. Our kids really enjoyed the aerodynamics experience of building an air-powered rocket and seeing how far it",
          "We had a great time at the Science Center. The kids loved the demonstrations and hands on activities. There were exhibits for all interests, from space to atoms, from chemistry to genetics. This is a place we will surely visit again.",
          "The Science Center of Iowa is one of my favorite, if not the favorite, place to take my family. We make the drive from Fort Dodge at least twice a year. There is always something fun and engaging for all ages. No fuss over being bored. My husband, being the science lover that he",
          "The Science Center offers a lot of fun activities designed to encourage interest in science, and kids love it. I'm not going to talk about any of that. IMAX all the way. The center houses an exceptional IMAX theater that plays a lot of informative documentaries, but also plays",
          "The Science Center is somewhere I used to go all the time as a kid. Lately though, I have been attending their mixology nights, and even a few times as a field trip with my preschool class. They have really stepped up their game as of late, and have been offering programs that",
          "Fun for all ages. The interesting solar system display. Many activities - rockets, race cars and dominoes were th he favorite.",
          "This was great for our pre-school kids, and I would imagine elementary school students would be amused as well. We went on a Thursday morning in the summer and had the place to ourselves.",
          "So we went when they had the dinosaur displays. They don't always have them. My boys had a pretty good time there but it would not be worth the huge price to get in without the dinosaurs for sure. I would never recommend going there unless you are seeing a special limited time",
          "Good for little kids. We made the mistake of thinking it was larger than it was. Admission was 20 dollars for two people with a coupon off the travel Des Moines site. We took note this is an extremely interactive place for children and could keep them entertained for hours.",
          "The kids love the hands on activities, the star theater and play area. We have had memberships that are great for going for a few hours especially on a raining day.",
          "There are only a few rooms of activities at the Science Center. And there is a lot of open space in the middle of it all. The kids think it's fun but we only go once a year. We visit other cities and go to their Science Centers and wonder why ours is so lame.",
          "Very nice place to spend the day with grandkids they have decent prices only thing that I wasn't please about was street parking otherwise fun place great staff",
          "We bought a membership again this year for the Science Center and need to use it more. Stopped in to watch the original Jurassic Park in the IMAX theater and kids really enjoyed the experience. Pretty neat and scary on the big screen! Spent an hour beforehand letting the kids",
          "Been there many times with the grandkids and they always enjoy it. We went in July and I actually though they would be to big (ages 11 and 13) and they enjoyed it just as much as they did when they were younger.",
          "Not a lot of street parking near by. Prices are pretty good. The kids had a great time and we stayed several hours. The demonstrations and iMax are also worth seeing.",
          "My wife and I cam specifically to see the planetarium show. On arrival we were told the facility was broken and there was no repair date. I asked to see the director and was told the director doesn't work weekends (when most of the visitors show up and parents bring their",
          "Hours of unique fun for kids of all ages. The Imax was fun I loved the dome room. This place is a must see for parents looking to entertain children.",
          "My two (almost three) year old could have stayed here all day I'm pretty sure. They have a fantastic offering of activities for anyone from probably age 2-8. Up to age 12 would probably have fun for an hour or so...anything beyond that, it's probably hit and miss (depending on",
          "There were 2 levels of exploring, live educational talks/demonstrations. A build it/test it/STEM area for 'scientific play' that my kids loved. There was a nature area which displayed live snakes and frogs. There were some stuffed birds and animals. It is very similar to the",
          "Getting in the door was a hassle. Showed pass ID . Girls were not very friendly. Kids said it was ok nothing special. Probably wouldn't go back.",
          "This should be top 3 in your itinerary!! I went with a 3 year old, 4 year old, husband, and senor citizens and I believe that ALL of them found it enjoyable. This is a suitable location to visit for a few hours (4-5) the kids especially loved the rocket launcher.",
          "My nephew (7) loves coming here when he is in town. Lots of hands on for an energetic mischief maker. Unfortunately the exhibits do not change & there aren't as many as one might expect based on the size of the building. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to walk through the last time",
          "We went for the IMAX (saw the Lemur film), but stayed for lunch and some exploration. The film was great, with a fun and informative short on how the IMAX screen & surround sound works showing before the feature. The cafeteria was expensive, as cafeterias are; but the pizza was",
          "My husband and I drove 2 hours to check this place out and spend some time in Des Moines and boy was I disappointed. We went without kids and there wasn't much to see. Even if I had kids, I don't think we would have spent that much longer there. The place is pretty big, but",
          "Not worth visiting, unless you have small children. Everything is broken! There are no attractions that amuses the adult or older teens. Everything is for small children. They need to learn from the pro science centers like Phoenix. Place should be renamed as Des Moines Small",
          "We were here from 9:30-4:00. The planetarium was closed which was disappointing, but it was advertised as closed so we knew in advance. Lots of hands on things, even for a teenager. One issue: the 'programs' changed locations from what the daily program stated and we missed the",
          "We took the kids to the Science center, they had alot for them to do and it was a blast. It was right in the center of downtown des moines the city is alot nicer from the last time I was here. Would def come again if the family comes again!",
          "We paid 20 dollars for my son and I to get in the science section only. We did not watch any movies. It took about 1.5 hours to complete the whole thing. My 6-year-old son was interested in the bubbles and playing with the fake fruits. I don't understand the reasons for all",
          "It's good but pretty quickly can be gone through. If it had the same approach like the science center in Omaha it would be better. It's a one and done type place.",
          "really full of very interesting science items laid out so you can understand how they work in laymans terms. this is well worth the visit as there is so much to see. you will like this venue as they took a lot of time and effort to put on a good program. Anyone will have a good",
          "I have children from 16 to 6. The youngest one still enjoys the Science Center, but the rest don't even want to go. We usually are completely done in 1.5 hours so the admission fee feels pretty steep. IMax was extra and the movie was ok. Gift shop is fun, you do not need to",
          "Was great for our kids (ages 10 & 6) and they enjoyed the IMAXX theater. Not over priced but not cheap either once you get through the gift shop on the way out.",
          "Two of us went - adults - and found out quickly that it's geared towards kids. We still had a good time, but it was a little boring for adults. Lesson learned :)",
          "They have an IMAX theater which is great. A decent gift shop. Regular exhibits as well as traveling exhibits. One of their most memorable traveling exhibits was Sue, the T-Rex. Great for the family.",
          "This was a great science center with lots of interactive activities for kids of all ages. They also have an IMAX theater (additional cost). We opted to do the space exploration movie. It was very educational. There is something for everyone here - dinosaurs, weather related,",
          "Great place to explore silence. Lots of hands on exhibits. More to do than you might think. We took 10 people and the cost was still very reasonable.",
          "This is a great place to take your kids on a rainy afternoon. Great exhibits! My kids had a blast and didn't want to leave!",
          "I was impressed by the interactive space-related activities available for kids. Astronaut suits, a replica of the rover...The IMAX theatre is expensive but worth visiting at least once. Highly recommended.",
          "This is definitely a place to take the kids. Lots of opportunities to experience scientific principles in a fun atmosphere.",
          "The center has a number of great displays. You might see anything from a complete display of the human body exposing all of the veins, blood vessels, ligaments muscle groups in detail to science displays and even a huge cinema surround dome theater. A great place for children",
          "Nice place to visit but I thought Iowa City children's museum was more engaging. Most fun I had was with the spinning table in which you try to spin an objects on the table while the table also spins.",
          "This focuses on science of interest to kids... lots of interactive stations, dinosaurs, and space exploration exhibits. We were disappointed th ific is designed primarily for families at the planetarium was closed during our visit. The IMAX theater has educational films of",
          "We took our grandchildren, 27 months and almost 5, to the Science Center on a recent Saturday. A dinosaur traveling exhibit is there now, and it was an attention-getter for our five-year-old grandson. Then we explored, and there's lots to see. Special care has been invested in",
          "Our family has been to many different science museums in other cities and this one is very good. The exhibits are spaced nicely so that they are not over crowded. The dinosaur exhibit was quite interesting and informative but still brief to keep the children's attention. The",
          "What a great way to spend a day. There are lots of fun exhibits that are mainstays with one large exhibit that is featured and changes. They also have an Imax theater. it's one of the smaller ones but still an Imax movie is like nothing else you'll see. There is parking on the",
          "The movie was great on the dome, because it was a space movie. I didn't get to see the museum, but it looked great for kids and they do things for adults too.",
          "We like the science center anyway, but the new dinosaur exhibit is great. It is engaging for the kids and for adults. I would encourage anyone to visit and check it out and of course there are all the other excellent exhibits to take a look at as well.",
          "I wouldn't call it a 'must see' if you're visiting Des Moines, but it's definitely a quality family attraction. Personally, after having been there a few times, I'm more likely to go when there is a special exhibit. The permanent exhibits are best for younger children, and there",
          "Each of our 3 grandsons spends 1 wk with us and a visit to the Science Ctr is a request we get by all 3 every year. Parking ramp nearby for easy access. Wish some exhibits would be updated and/or changed out more often.",
          "We had attended the Science Center through the years, but it didn't hold our kids attention long enough. We thought it was too expensive for a family activity for the regular exhibits. They just held their first Mini Maker Faire, we used a GroupOn coupon, so it was 1/2 off",
          "Saw a lot of original ideas. A lot of hands on stuff for kids. It was a little crowded. There was an awesome laser light show and Lego activities.",
          "We all learned something and had a great time. It is very informative and an amazing time for kids and parents to have together.",
          "We had a good afternoon here, even kept the teenagers interest. The IMAX movie was my first and very cool. I would have thought that they would have more exhibits because they did not lack space. And the parking situation could be improved.",
          "As our children are getting older (ages 8 & 9) we have started relying more on Science Centers and less on Children's Museums as a form of hands on fun and education. This facility was large and many exhibits looked brand new so we were initially excited when we walked in. But",
          "We enjoyed our time doing \"science-y\" things and learning more about the experiments, interactive stations and watching the movie one the big screen. There is something there to entertain almost everyone.",
          "This is by far one of the best science centers I have been to. I would recommend you have at least 3 hours. The cost is $11.00 for adults and children 2 to 12 and under are $7.00. You have to pay for parking and it runs $3.00 for the first hour and then $1.00 each additional",
          "This was the last stop on our weeklong vacation. It surpassed my expectations. The interactive exhibits were fun and interesting to the kids. They were learning and having fun at the same time. It was not crowded so they could take their time and tweak their projects and try",
          "We went here as we were visiting for a week while my husband worked in Des Moines. We came on a Monday because I saw on their website that they have story time at 10:30am. The story time was fun, as the gal read a few books on the screen & all around the rest of the",
          "Exhibits and activities get changed several times a year. I like that SCI meets the educational needs of toddlers. The small discoveries space is great and not very busy during the week.",
          "It's not often you find something that is truly interesting and enjoyable for the entire span of age groups, but the Science Center of Iowa surprised us. Even my 11 yr old said \"I thought it was going to be boring--reading lots of cards about stuff but it was really fun!\" Many",
          "We were looking for something to do while my husband had meetings (we came in from out if town). We arrived right as they opened, and really enjoyed very low crowds for the first hour. After that, the place filled up very quickly with a couple of school groups and several",
          "Great place for a wedding reception, roomy and open, parking is convenient. Patio available for music and dancing.",
          "we took my 19 month old daughter with us thinking if nothing else she might like the stars when we got there we found that there is a great area for kids under 5 though there isnt really any folks on staff to explain the science behind it so I kinda felt like a teacher than a",
          "They have Blank cinema, facilities, souvenir shop, and exhibits that kids, family will certainly enjoy.",
          "The Science Center was fun. My daughter loved that you could forecast the weather here and have fun with a green screen. They also had an awesome Space exhibit and theater. Where we spent the most time is the room with all the stations where you could create a car with legos",
          "Our family spends at least 1-2 weekends a month there and they love it. It's perfect-sized for a few hours on a weekend, and the shows are fun.",
          "So much to do and see, even for a 3 year old. We enjoyed learning about \"One World, One Sky\" with Sesame Street characters in the Star Theatre during our visit. Small Discoveries is always our first stop. This is a wonderful place to spend several hours on a rainy day!",
          "This is for elementary school children. They don't tell you that. They just take your $11 and hand you a map. There is little to interest adults. I see no reason for an adult to visit unless it is with family or as a chaperone for school events. There is nothing of museum",
          "Looking for fun and education? Or even just something to do that doesn't require a parka and snow boots in the winter? This is a great attraction.",
          "We have taken our grandkids and have gone on our own, and both experiences have been wonderful. The exhibits and activities are varied enough to tickle the imagination and broaden the mind of any age group.",
          "While visiting friends, our two families spent an entire afternoon at the science center. The kids were aged 4, 5, 6, and 8. The highlights for our group was the \"make your own rocket\", the snakes/weather broadcasting, and the imax movie. The facility was very clean, laid out",
          "The grandchildren AND Grandparents were thrilled! The dinosaurs were huge. There was an excavation area and the children learned to brush and excavate a site appropriately.",
          "I brought my six year old here for half a day and she had a blast. There are a number of exhibits all of which are appropriate for younger children. There were also a few presentations (toys in space was one) that held the interest of my daughter. I don't think there would be",
          "We were there when the Da Vinci exhibit was on display, and a fine one it was. We enjoyed all of it! There are some interesting interactive things to do also. We were there on off hours, when kids were in school. It was not too croweded when we first got there, but before we",
          "My son is 5 and loves the Science Center. I think he would go every week if we could. I'm not sure how older kids would like it, but for preschool and elementary aged it's great. They also have excellent travelling exhibits, like the T-Rex.",
          "Nothing to brag about, your average science center. But as a ASCT memeber I get to go into free so why not!",
          "I would recommend taking children to the Science Center, there is so much to see and do, they really liked it. There is a lot of hands on craft things, it was a lot different than I had expected, the kids love it. Yes, go see it for yourself, nice on a rainy day. Carolyn H",
          "We have 3 kids (5, 8 & 10) and we managed to see and do it all in less than 2 hours and we were all a little bored. We live in MPLS so we have a large Science Museum here so hard to compare to that. Just glad that we went on the Family Friday night while we were in town so it",
          "This was our first visit and we loved it! They have areas for kids of all ages (including a special toddler room) with tons of hands on activities. Also their free shows are a MUST SEE! Iowa Skies and Deep Freeze were really cool.",
          "This was our second visit, we purchased a membership the first time knowing we would be back in town visiting family throughout the year. I like that they rotate in new displays on the bottom floor. I am afraid that the kids will get bored with the upstairs areas after a couple",
          "Our kids (ages 4,6,8) had a great time at the Science Center. We stayed about three hours and the kids were interested the whole time. The museum is interactive with lots of different experiments and ideas. I like that several of the exhibits could be manipulated by all three",
          "This is a great place to spend a day with the kids or grandkids. There are many hands on displays for the children to do and learn from. Also many displays to read and learn from. Not only is this place entertaining but very educational. Adults will also find this place",
          "Great lectures made fun ! kids loved+want to go back again,I'm sure we will! Probably a better fit for kids a little older,there seemed to be a lot of babies getting in the way. If your kids can't say+ spell Science,they are too young. Take them when they are older+ can get",
          "We spent the day from open to close here. A t-rex named sue exhibit was there along with the iowa state science team. My kids learned about dinosaurs, nano science, they did a ton of experiments. They enjoyed the acting out being a weatherman with the green screen. They got",
          "So fascinating! Educational! Fun things to do! A lot of hands on learning for the kids and everyone else. Loved the IMAX movie! Wish I could go more often.",
          "We went here and I guess we were expecting alot more then it was? I think kids would enjoy it alot more then we did.. the best part of the whole center is the sky dome. other then that it's completely forgetable. boring and has about 4 rooms.",
          "Would be good for 3-7 year old. Not much for older 10+ kids to do. Loud and not very well kept up. Carpets could use a good cleaning, and bathrooms not well stocked.",
          "It is very pricey for the little bit it is. It really does not have that musch at it. The exhibits and Imax theater cost extra.Not suitable for children under 4",
          "The science center offers fun activities for the kids. We have a membership and have gone frequently so I can say that as an adult I am worn out with it. But they get a new themed exhibit a couple times a year that we go check out. They have food which is actually pretty",
          "Location is easily found and parking most times is easily available. With kids, the entrance time can seem very long. It will be difficult to get close up to exhibits during busy times. Encourage them, however, to work hands-on as the exhibits will be more meaningful. It's",
          "Over-priced - not sure how the average Iowa family with kids could afford it - too crowded with children, definitely NOT for adults who love science looking to learn more. I miss the old Science Center; it was less Disneyfied.",
          "We spent a Saturday afternoon here with out 7-year-old daughter who is very interested in science. We had a lovely time as a family! We saw the T-rex exhibit (it is a traveling exhibit, not permanent). Upstairs was by far the best part of our visit. The star room where they",
          "Our extended family visited the museum on Easter Saturday, a very busy day. The museum is perfect for children of many ages. The staff were attentive, and despite a large number of attendees, one did not feel crowded or pressured. The ZAP show involved the children and was",
          "We spent two lovely days at the science center with a 3 year old and a 5 year old. The 5 year old really enjoyed the presentations on the great hall. The speakers are very engaging and describe the concepts simply, but use correct terms like sublimation. The Sue dinosaur exhibit",

          "We have been to several Science Centers. This looked like a good place for young children, but there is very little for older children. I think it is even limited for any child over 8 years old. There were a few very nice exhibits, but unless you use a map, it is hard to get",

          "I'll try and keep this short. I think the Science center had the possibility to be really great but those that planned and selected the main exhibits (not the traveling ones) did a poor job. The place is style over substance. Most exhibits have a preschool feel to them and most",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) quite often. Snowfall averages 35.3 inches (90 cm) per season, and annual precipitation averages 36.0 inches (914 mm), with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city. Population density was 2,515.6 inhabitants per square mile (971.3/km2). There were 88,729 housing units at an average density of 1,097.2 per square mile (423.6/km2). The racial makeup of the city for Unincorporated areas not merged with the city proper was 66.2% White, 15.5% African Americans, 0.5% Native American, 4.0% Asian, and 2.6% from Two or more races. People of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race, made up 12.1% of the population. The city's racial make up during the 2010 census was 76.4% White, 10.2% African American, 0.5% Native American, 4.4% Asian (1.2% Vietnamese, 0.9% Laotian, 0.4% Burmese, 0.3% Asian Indian, 0.3% Thai, 0.2% Chinese, 0.2% Cambodian, 0.2% Filipino, 0.1% Hmong, 0.1% Korean, 0.1% Nepalese), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 5.0% from other races, and 3.4% from two or more races.

        "wiki": "The Jordan House is an historic building located in West Des Moines, Iowa, United States.   It was built by abolitionist James C. Jordan and was a station on the Underground Railroad in Iowa.  It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1973.\n\n\n== James C. Jordan ==\nJordan was a cattle farmer from Virginia, although the area is now in West Virginia, who settled in central Iowa in 1846.  As a businessman he organized the State Bank of Des Moines and was involved in bringing the railroad to Des Moines.  He platted Valley Junction and raised $70,000 to create a railhead there, which was also near his cattle operation.  Today the area is the city of West Des Moines.  As a civic leader he served on the Polk County Board of Supervisors, and was elected to both the Iowa Senate and the Iowa House of Representatives.  While in the state legislature he led the effort to move the state capital from Iowa City to Des Moines.  Jordan was married twice.  He and his first wife Melinda had six children.  After her death, he married Cynthia Adams and the family grew to eleven children.\n\n\n== History ==\nJames Jordan's first dwelling in Polk County was a lean-to tent that he replaced with a log cabin in 1848.  Two years later construction started on the present house.  They moved into the basement when it was completed.  It was divided into a kitchen and a bed/sitting room.  In 1851 the first phase of the upper floors was completed.  The white frame house is two stories tall.  The first phase of the house featured an elegant entrance, two large rooms on the first floor and a walnut staircase that led to two large bedrooms on the second floor. The kitchen remained in the basement.\nBefore the American Civil War the house was a station on the Underground Railroad.  Jordan, who was a staunch abolitionist, was considered the chief conductor in Polk County.  John Brown stayed in the house at least two times, and one of those times he was leading 12 slaves to freedom.  The house was also a place where travelers stopped on their journeys to the American West.  It was also a gathering place for local businessmen and politicians.\nThe house was expanded in 1870.  The addition provided space for another parlor, a dining room, library, and kitchen. Porches were added to the east and south sides of the house. A second entrance was also added with another black walnut staircase to the six additional bedrooms on the second floor.\nThe Jordan family continued to live in the house until 1947 when it was sold to the Church of the Nazarene who used the house as a part of their summer campground.  The West Des Moines Historical Society bought the house in 1978.  They renovated it as a period house and use it as a museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "West Des Moines is a city in Polk, Dallas, and Warren counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. Most of the city is in Polk County, with slivers extending into Dallas and Warren counties.\nAs of the 2010 census the city population was 56,609, with the United States Census Bureau estimating a population of 67,899 in 2019. West Des Moines is the second-largest city in the Des Moines metropolitan area and the sixth-largest city in Iowa. It ranked 94th in Money magazine's list of the \"100 Best Places to Live and Launch\" in 2008, 77th and 57th on the 100 Best Places to Live in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and 18th on the Hipster Cities of 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe West Des Moines area used to be home to the Sac and Fox tribes. Near the stroke of midnight on October 11, 1845 a gunshot was fired by a cattle farmer, James Cunningham Jordan (1813\u20131893) to declare that the area was open for Anglo-European settlement. His residence, the Jordan House, has been restored and is now home to the West Des Moines Historical Society. The Jordan House was a stop on the Underground Railroad, and abolitionist John Brown stayed on Jordan property multiple time, at least once while escorting a group of freedom seeking slaves to Canada. In West Des Moines' early years, the town was a trading and shipping junction. West Des Moines incorporated as the city of Valley Junction on October 9, 1893.\nIn its early days Valley Junction was home to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's switching facilities and repair shops due to its location at the junction of several railroad lines. The Rock Island's facilities moved out of Valley Junction and back into Des Moines in 1936.\nThe speed limit of ten miles (16 km) an hour had existed in Valley Junction since 1911 for all automobiles. But in 1915 an Englishman named Jack Prince built a one-mile (1.6 km) oval race track, designed to let race cars break that speed limit ten times over. The wooden track was made of 980,000 feet (300,000 m) of 2x4's laid on edge. It was one of 24 such tracks nationwide; with seating for over 10,000 people. On August 7, 1915, the eyes of the auto world were on Valley Junction in anticipation of the fastest 300-mile (480 km) auto race in history. Ralph DePalma, winner of the Indianapolis 500 that year, was one of at least a dozen drivers vying for the $10,000 purse. Before a crowd of 7,000 people, a tire blew, lunging Joe Cooper's car over the rail. Cooper was killed and his mechanic was injured. Later while rounding a curb, a wheel of Billy Chandler's Duesenberg failed, cartwheeling the car into the infield and fatally injuring his mechanic, Maurice Keeler. Chandler was seriously injured. Smiling Ralph Mulford won the race with DePalma a close 2nd. This baptism by blood left a bad taste in the mouth of the locals, and the track was closed two years later. The wood was salvaged and then used to construct buildings in Valley Junction.\nThe serious dilemma of school overcrowding was partially addressed in 1916. The bond issue to build a new high school for $50,000 was approved by a 2 to 1 vote. The similar new grade school issue was defeated soundly. Building commenced and by September of the following year, the doors of the new Valley High School were opened at 8th and Hillside. As a part of schoolboard policy, only first class college-educated teachers were hired. By 1919, the rooms of the new high school were filled. A new junior high school was proposed, approved, and completed by the fall of 1923.\nThe new school was the only bright spot in the otherwise uncertain dreary years of 1922 and 1923. The foundations of the city were shaken by a 22-month-machinist strike at the Rock Island shops. Starting 1922-07-01, 600 workers were idled. The railroad company reacted by bringing replacement workers into town to break the strike. The replacements were mostly Mexican and African-American laborers brought up from Oklahoma by R. C. Hyde, the master mechanic at the shops. For their own protection they lived in boxcars and tiny houses in an area south of Railroad Avenue and west of the main rail yards. The area was dubbed \"Hyde Park\" by the strikers. The resulting hardships suffered by the idled workers led the most desperate to choose between breaking the strike or letting their family starve. It was a time which pitted neighbor against neighbor, tearing at the fabric of the community. Two men shot themselves in desperation before the strike ended.\nAlthough the 1920s was the era of prohibition for the rest of the country, Valley Junction had officially become a dry town in 1915. The '20s were not all doom and gloom for Valley Junction. The businessmen of the community dress in drag for a play called \"The Womenless Wedding\". Simple joys of small town life were reflected in the faces of the children: having a part in the school play, flying the first kite, dressing up for the May Day pageant, or riding in the Fourth of July Parade. The older kids enjoyed the chance to take the trolley to Des Moines for an afternoon of shopping and maybe lunch along the river. The notion of the mobile society was embraced by the youth. A joy ride in a fast jalopy to Greenwood Park for a game of tennis, or off to the country for a picnic mirrored the infatuation America had for the car. The wealthier, older, and more established were not left out either. By purchasing land from the Ashworth family farm, the Des Moines Golf and Country Club left Des Moines in 1923 for a more picturesque setting along the White Pole Road auto trail at 8th Street allowing the High Society of Des Moines a relaxing and rather pleasant drive away from the hussle and bussle of the city for a day of golf in the Valley.  By the close of the decade, however, the picnic was over. The Depression was especially hard for the workers of Valley Junction because the railroads had finished pulling out by 1936, and the Keystone Coal Factory had to close because of flooding in the tunnels.\nBy 1937, only two trains stopped daily; the sagging business climate needed a boost. Members of the commercial club believed the only way to attract new industry would be to change the name of the city. They thought the name \"Valley Junction\" conveyed the image of an old-fashioned and backwards town to prospective employers and residents. The name of \"West Des Moines\" would give it the respectability and prestige the town desperately needed. There was a precedent by way of an editorial in the Valley Junction Express in 1905 that suggested dropping \"Junction\" from the name, but nothing came of it. The opposition feared the change to West Des Moines would cause property owners to be taxed the same as Des Moines. It was also declared as a step toward annexation by Des Moines. A third and final election was held on December 7, 1937.\n\nOn January 1, 1938, the name \"Valley Junction\" was relegated to the past, and the new city of West Des Moines took the first steps to a new identity. Helping to establish this new identity, the most identifiable trait was the suspension of all property taxes between 1936 and 1938. This was due to the profits of the water department. Today the original business district of West Des Moines has been preserved as Historic Valley Junction. It features many locally owned specialty shops and restaurants as well as a weekly farmers' market.\nThough the name was changed, the community's commitment to education was bolstered by funds from the Public Works Administration. Despite the Depression, a new elementary school and the Old Valley Football Stadium were built and dedicated on May 24, 1939, at 8th and Hillside. The venerable Lincoln School was razed in 1938 to make way for the new building. Longfellow was retired in 1939 and then sold in 1940 for $1000. In 1955, West Des Moines Elementary School at Walnut and 6th was renamed \"Nellie Phenix Elementary\" in honor of the former principal.  The late 1930s were very good years in the school's athletic teams, producing memorable names: True, Gavin, Swink, and Sherbo. Charles Swink was a multi-record holder in track and field. His record at the Drake Relays stood for twenty years.\nAn overgrown concrete eyesore on Ashworth Road soon became the musical mecca for the surrounding area on June 6, 1939, when Tom Archer opened the Val Air Ballroom. The site was originally the location of the stillborn Wilson Rubber company factory. Intended to bolster World War I tire production, the end of the war in 1918 left only a large concrete slab. Patrons of the Val Air could dance under a canopy of stars to the melodious sounds of Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and other big bands. The war years brought new vitality to the community without a cost.\nThen and now, flooding frequently dampens, but has not broken the residents' spirits. Unpredictable waters of the Raccoon River and Walnut Creek have often exceeded their banks due to large amounts of rain in the summer and snowmelt in the spring, filling the streets and damaging homes and businesses.\nIn 1950 West Des Moines had a population of 5,615, but the city grew as many new housing subdivisions were built. West Des Moines annexed the neighboring community of Clover Hills in 1950, the town of Ashawa, a former Rock Island railroad stop, in 1957, and the town of Commerce, along the Raccoon River, in 1960. City government also grew, and when the venerable city hall could not keep up with the city's expansion, the city opened a new municipal building in 1954. With the influx of students, the school district's ever-expanding borders continually compromised classroom capacity. Children attended school in former homes near Phenix, with classes in hallways and living rooms. Space was even rented from the new Catholic grade school. In 1959 alone, 150\u2013200 new homes were built, adding to the population's growth. The construction of Interstate 35, Interstate 80, and Interstate 235 in the 1960s brought more people and businesses to West Des Moines. This construction also caused the Des Moines Golf and Country Club to sell its location along Ashworth Road and 8th Street and then move to its current location in Dallas County. In 1966, Dowling Catholic High School/St. Joseph Educational Center purchased 55-acre (22 ha) from the Des Moines Golf and Country Club and, subsequently, moved from Des Moines and opened at its current location, 1400 Buffalo Road, in the fall of 1972. Several retail and office complexes opened along the I-235 corridor after the freeway's completion, including Valley West Mall, which opened in 1975. West Des Moines' population jumped from 11,964 in 1960 to 31,702 in 1990.\nWest Des Moines expanded into Dallas County during the 1990s and 2000s, once again placing the premier golf courses of the Des Moines Golf and Country Club in its city limits and punctuated by the opening of one of the best golf courses in Iowa at the Glen Oaks Country Club along with the West Glen Town Center and the largest in the state of Iowa, Jordan Creek Town Center and shopping mall in 2004. Major commercial construction is underway around the area, including the opening of many additional hotels, shopping centers, and office buildings, including a new Wells Fargo corporate campus. In 2007 construction started on the Village of Ponderosa, an urban-inspired and pedestrian friendly community. In 2005 West Des Moines annexed land in Warren County for the first time. Seeing the land to the south of Des Moines as extremely valuable, especially with the completion of a major \"South-Belt Freeway\" system, the cities of Norwalk and West Des Moines are actively competing for land in the northern part of Warren County. From 1990 to 2015, West Des Moines is the fastest growing city in Iowa according to land mass.\nDuring the 1990s a new city/school campus opened near the intersection of South 35th Street and Mills Civic Parkway. West Des Moines' new police station opened in April 1992. This was followed by the opening of a new public library in 1996; the library served as temporary home for West Des Moines' city hall until a new building was dedicated in late 2002. The campus also features a new stadium for Valley High School that also opened in 2002. On the same property, the West Des Moines School district operates Valley Southwoods, a freshman high school with over 600 students that opened in 1996. Turning the West Des Moines Community Schools into a two high school district was not acceptable. In 2004, August Hillside Elementary opened on the former site of Hillside Junior High and Old Valley Stadium, which was demolished in 2001. In 2012, Clegg Park Elementary was renovated and opened as the new Walnut Creek Campus which is the district's alternative high school. Major renovation and additions were completed at Valley High in 2007 and again in 2015.\n\n\n== Government ==\nWest Des Moines uses the mayor-council form of government with a city manager appointed by the city council. The council consists of the mayor, two at-large members, and three members from each of the city's three wards. The mayor and all council members serve four-year terms. Rick Messerschmidt served as the interim mayor of the city following former mayor Eugene Meyer's resignation in January 2007; On April 17 Steve Gaer was elected mayor during a special election. Tom Hadden is the city manager of West Des Moines.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nWest Des Moines is located at 41\u00b034\u203225\u2033N 93\u00b045\u20321\u2033W (41.573739, \u221293.750359). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 39.48 square miles (102.25 km2), of which 38.59 square miles (99.95 km2) is land and 0.89 square miles (2.31 km2) is water. West Des Moines' location in the Raccoon River valley has left parts of the city, particularly the Valley Junction area, prone to flooding. After the Great Flood of 1993, a floodwall was constructed along Walnut Creek (near the boundary with Des Moines) to protect that area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWest Des Moines has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa).\n\n\n=== Street numbering ===\nWhile nearby Clive, Urbandale, and Windsor Heights use the same street numbers for north-south streets that Des Moines uses, West Des Moines uses its own street numbering system. Thus, 86th Street in Clive and Urbandale becomes 22nd Street in West Des Moines. Iowa Highway 28, which forms most of the boundary between Des Moines and West Des Moines, is 63rd Street in Des Moines but 1st Street in West Des Moines. Many of the east-west streets share the same name with Des Moines, although the numbering of these east-west streets starts over in West Des Moines.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe median income for a household in the city was $54,139, and the median income for a family was $70,600 (in a 2008 estimate, these figures had risen to $61,256 and $83,800 respectively, in 2008 inflation-adjusted dollars).

          "Plan to spend a little time. There is lots to see and the people working in the town are very informative and knowledgeable. Wear good shoes for walking. If you do the whole thing, you'll end up walking more than a mile. The farms are pretty cool, but the town is the best",
          "This was an enjoyable outing. Lots of history to see especially for our young teenage granddaughter who really likes history so she loved it here. I will say it is a lot of walking some on uneven dirt trails. There are benches to rest on but I would advise taking a bottle of",
          "The farms are set up as a timeline from the Ioway Native Americans and three more eras of farms in the Iowa past. Being able to see the rustic nature of life advance to much more convenience helps children see the passage of time - and appreciate how easy we have it now.",
          "Our family loved our visit to Living History Farms! My 11-year old son was the perfect age to appreciate and understand what life was like back then, though I think kids of all ages would get something out of their visit. My husband and I enjoyed it just as much as our son did.",

          "It's an open air museum with real life demonstrations of activities needed to survive farm and home life prior to our modern era. Demonstrations change daily, and there is usually some opportunity to either watch up close, or at times do some hands on. You can tour all the",

          "Plan to spend a full day. It's best during planting and harvest seasons, but any time is good for a visit. If you really want to experience 1800's living, have dinner at the Tangen home (requires reservations).",
          "I love to go visit the Living History in the Spring and tour the shops to watch things being made the old fashioned way. Sometimes I can take a riding tour on a gay rack pulled by horses. The old farm house is great to tour and talk to the guides about living in Iowa in the",

          "We spent a morning here while traveling on our way to Yellowstone. Very interesting displays with locals dressed on period clothing in each of the farming situations (1700\"s, 1800's, and 1900's). The farms and gardens are actually functioning farms using the equipment of the",
          "Very nice updates to the site and lots to see and do. It's interesting even if you have a farming knowledge but especially for people who do not. Small town, 3 different farm sites, animals, live demos of what life was like. The one thing that might be difficult for some is",
          "I came here with my mother in law who grew up in rural Iowa during the depression. The farm has 3 parts, indian, 1850's and 1900. We both were impressed with the extent of the exhibits. Phyliss remarked how similar the 1900 farm was to the one where she grew up. They also have a",

          "The Living History Farms is just as good as when I visited as a child! Rather than just displaying objects in a museum - they truly bring the past to life. The staff (volunteers?) in period costumes have such a deep knowledge and clearly take delight in sharing it with",

          "I thought that Living History Farms would be primarily devoted to farming, but I was WAY wrong. This really is an exceptional depiction of how non-urban life progressed in the Midwest (not just Iowa) from 1700 to 1900. You can read about life in earlier eras in a book, but",

          "We first went on the opening day and there was hardly anyone there. The demonstrations were great and informative. We went back on a day when there were school groups. The same people didn't seem interested in talking with us. In short, it's a great place but avoid weekdays",

          "It takes you back to the late 1800's and there is also the West side where you can see how the Native Americans, those in the 1800's and 1900's civil war lived. It's good if you like historic thngs. Worth the money and inexpensive for family attraction.",
          "We arrived just before 2:00 and they close at 4:00, so we just spent several hours walking around \"town\", instead of trying to rush through the farms. It was nice to see so many workers in each building doing demonstrations, answering questions and interacting with visitors.",
          "This place seemed to fall short of my expectations. The concept is great and the place was very clean. My issue is that it really isn't very hands on for children nor did I feel like the staff was very engaging. A few staff members, Kate, Pam, and Corey truly seemed to enjoy",

          "Went for my husband's birthday and enjoyed the special turkey dinner they hold during the winter. The food was good and period specific, it was a small group (needing reservations), the cost was expensive, but worth it for a small personnel, several courses, tour of the place",
          "Each of the major areas has something special to offer. You can learn about the first people who lived here and see how things have changed in the past as well as what the future might be like. Seasonal and special events add even more to all the people who \"live\" in the past",

          "I only had 2.5 hours to spend here, but should have stayed at least twice that long. The farm is divided into two sections and there is a tractor that takes you between the sites. The first section consists of the Ioway Farm, 1850 Farm, and 1900 Farm, and there was a wooded",

        "wiki": "The Des Moines Art Center is an art museum with an extensive collection of paintings, sculpture, modern art and mixed media.  It was established in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Art Center traces its roots to 1916, when the Des Moines Association of Fine Arts established gallery space at the Public Library of Des Moines on the banks of the Des Moines River downtown. Several exhibitions were shown each year, and works of art were periodically purchased for the association's permanent collection. In 1938, the DMAF moved their collection to a building on Walnut Street. Planning for a permanent building began in 1943 after a sizeable donation from the trust of James D. Edmundson. In 1945, DMAF evolved into the Des Moines Art Center. A site along Grand Avenue in the city's Greenwood Park was designated as the preferred location. Construction began in 1945; the museum itself opened in 1948, with additional wings constructed in 1968 and 1985.\nIn 2009, the Art Center expanded its mission to operate the Pappajohn Sculpture Park, located in Western Gateway Park downtown.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nArtists included in the permanent collection are Edward Hopper, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Francis Bacon, Georgia O'Keeffe, Gerhard Richter, Claes Oldenburg, Mary Cassatt, Auguste Rodin, Grant Wood, Deborah Butterfield, Paul Gauguin, Eva Hesse, Ronnie Landfield, Roy Lichtenstein, George Segal, Mark Rothko, John Singer Sargent, Joseph Cornell and Takashi Murakami.\nSome paintings from the collection are well known examples of the artist and/or movement they represent.  These include Edward Hopper's Automat from 1927, which was reproduced on a postage stamp as well as used for a cover of Time, Stanton MacDonald Wright's Synchromy which has been reproduced in numerous texts about the artist/movement, Francis Bacon's Portrait of Pope Innocent from 1953 which likewise is considered a signature work by the artist and appeared in Robert Hughes \"Shock of the New\" BBC series in the early 1980s.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nA large main gallery rotates through several exhibitions throughout the year, most of which are featured from one to three months at a time. These shows include solo shows by internationally recognized artists, travelling shows from other institutions, and group shows organized around a theme. The rest of the museum space highlights the permanent collections in various ways, including small spaces for short-term print and photography shows, a video gallery, and long-term installations organized both chronologically and thematically. Included on the grounds are outdoor sculptures and a rose garden.  An external reflecting pool is surrounded on all sides by the museum.\nThe architecture of the original museum wing was designed in a combination of Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles by Eliel Saarinen in 1945 and completed in 1948.\nThe second addition, originally intended for large-scale sculpture, was designed in a Modernist style by I.M. Pei in 1966 and completed in 1968.  Legend says that Pei designed the south windows, which look out onto the rose garden, to resemble \"PEI\", but he has denied this.\nThe third wing was designed by Richard Meier and completed in 1985.  This wing was designed to allow as much natural ambient light in as possible. \nThe Art Center also includes a restaurant and a gift shop.  Workshops, film festivals and lectures are conducted on a regular basis through the museums large studio program, with classes available for students of all ages.  Museum hours are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday from 11am to 4pm, Thursday from 11am to 9pm, Saturday from 10am to 4pm, and Sunday from noon to 4pm.  Admission is free.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "We had a little free time and wanted to experience this whimsical park. The hardest part of visiting this park was finding street parking. There is an online map that identifies all 31 sculptures. It was a fairly hot day so we didn't take time to listen to the 1 to 4 minute",
          "The sculpture park is about 2 city block rectangle. Some very interesting artwork to be seen. Fun to see if you can find your initials together on the largest of the pieces and probably the centerpiece of the park. I found mine! Worth a quick walk around.",
          "If you go through Des Moines and it is nice out, go to this park. It was a beautiful evening when we went. Lots of families enjoying the evening and checking out all of the beautiful sculptures within the park. I just wished we would have brought dinner so we could have stayed",

          "Located in the middle of downtown, this is a great place to take a walk or a break from the hustle and bustle of your day. We stopped on our vacation after seeing reviews. There are a large amount of sculptures that you can check out (non-interactive for the most part), but",

          "Favorite sculptures were Ancient forest and Juno From a distance some of the sculptures don\u2019t seem as impressive as when you are standing near them. The sculptures don\u2019t have individual placards so you definitely want to get a map that has the sculptures names and descriptions.",

          "I went to the sculpture park with my art club. It was very enjoyable except for all the bees and wasps.",
          "This is an interesting place to tour but I would not go great lengths to see it. Its about a square block in the downtown of a small city that is spread out. A nice social place for people to gather. Some sculptures were very interesting and others not so much. There is no",

          "We toured the sculpture garden with friends and it was a nice venue to walk and talk but not overly impressive. It's good it is free and for that, I would recommend at least one visit.",
          "My gal was more impressed than I but we were both glad we visited. On our way out of town, we pulled over and parked on the street alongside the park. We fed the meter 20 minutes worth and that's about how long we needed to explore the works. We really appreciate philanthropic",
          "Lots of items to view. Many different mediums. Day we were there they had a wedding party there also taking pictures",
          "Fantastic place for cool photos. Wish there were a few more places to sit or to hangout on the green space.",
          "OMG. It's just wonderful. Full disclosure--back in the 1980s, I worked at the Des Moines Art Center and loved the city. But this is really a new and hoppin' place. But back to the Sculpture Park. It's a grassy set of slopes with important and beautifully sited sculptures. It is",

          "The Pappajohn family had all of these sculptures in their yard and donated them to the City for the sculpture walk. It's definitely worth the walk thru the park - each sculpture is totally unique and one of a kind.",
          "We had gone to the art museum earlier that afternoon and decided to stop by the outdoor sculpture park before leaving town, and we're very glad we did!",
          "So glad our city is trying to build its culture and provide some art abd green spaces. However, the selection of art pieces is atrocious! You have black and white balls, a crazy mean looking rabbit, items that look like kidney beans, again in metal and not pretty. With as much",
          "Lots of great areas to sit and relax while the kids ran around catching Pokemon. Lots of families enjoying the park and spending time together. The kids had lots of fun and we were able to relax under a shade tree.",
          "My wife and I went there to check out the art. Our two kids (11 and 13) were there for Pokemon Go. My guess is that about 20% were there for art, 80% for Pokemon Go. Which was fine with us; it was good to see so many people at the attraction compared to the last time we were",

          "The park is nicely set up and it was good to stretch the legs a little and walk around to the different sculptures. There are not a lot, but it is free, and according to the sign there is an audio tour you can look up. If you miss it don't worry about it, but if you want a nice",
          "It was fun! I brought my dogs with me and took pictures with the sculptures. They have a lot of sculptures and at night it is all lit up. Parking you have to pay with meter so heads up there. Also a lot of people there playing Pokemon go! I would definitely make it a point to",
          "I'd never been to Des Moines before, so we decided to visit the sculpture park while in the area. On street parking is coin meters. Unfortunately, I didn't have any change with me. The 1st parking garage that I pulled into was also coin metered. I finally found a garage that",

          "There are so many neat and different sculptures in a space that is big enough that it's not crowded, but yet small enough that you can see everything. Plenty of photo ops and very easy to get around, even for those that have difficulty walking.",
          "People seem to love this place. I've lived in Des Moines for awhile now and never understood the hype. If you like really abstract art then I guess you'd like this place but the art kinda looks like a joke to me. The things they call some of the pieces is ridiculous. The piece",
          "High quality sculptures set outdoors near the west end of downtown Des Moines. Many sculptures by recognized artists. My fave is the metal human form composed of letters of the alphabet. It speaks of our inextricable link with language & symbol. Powerful!",

          "Very nice to visit, especially since it is free! The sculptures were very interesting and thought provoking. You can spend as little or as much time as you want to. We found the park on trip advisors and also an app I have called \"Roadside Attractions\". I felt alittle silly",
          "While the Papajohn Sculpture Park is a great attraction to visit, be warned some of the sculptures are a bit questionable. There are several along Grand Avenue resembling giant spiders & larvae. Strange yet worth the visit assuming you go with low expectations. As compared to",

          "Neat little park. The kids enjoyed stretching their legs and running around. There was plenty of metered parking along both sides. It was $0.45 for 1 hour. There were also some restaurants right around the park you could grab food at. I don't think it's something we'd do again,",

          "I visited on an amazing weather day. This park as beautiful sculptures in it, and they are spread out across a huge lawn so you have enough space to admire them without bumping into anyone. There were even people lying under trees enjoying the weather. I was happy to see that",
          "This is a nice place to check out while in Des Moines. There is metered parking all around the park so make sure you have some quarters! The sculptures are well done and spread out over a large area. There is no cost to view the sculptures.",
          "There are some neat sculptures, but it's in a small area, and it's not a place I would visit more then once",
          "If you are downtown you can't miss seeing this park. Modern rabbits sit around ( like one at Washington University in St Louis) and horse like sculptures amid other larger sculptures look strangely at home together in this urban park. It is interesting to walk among the art",
          "This park was located in downtown and was near some other things we went to see. It is totally worth a half hour of time to walk around it and to see the cool sculptures.",
          "You can stroll through this park leisurely and read the provided guided tour booklet to truly understand the works of art and the artists' visions. Or you can let your kids run through the park and pose by their favorite sculpture. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy this",
          "It was a beautiful day to be outside and the walk through the slightly winding path of the Pappajohn Sculpture Park was a perfect setting. There is no admission and no gates that interfere with the beautiful pathways. The park hosts a collection of widely varying sculptures.",
          "Creative and interesting sculpture park just on the outskirts of the downtown core of Des Moines. It's a relatively small park that's easy to walk around, and the sculptures are curious, even enigmatic.",

          "My husband and I went to college in Des Moines in the 90's. We have made a few trips back and this sculpture park is unique and a lovely addition to the downtown. It makes for some cool photo ops! Highly recommend a stop. It's a quick jaunt, or take a picnic and lounge!",
          "My husband & I visited here on his business trip. Beautiful garden and easy walk and informational. The sculptures and pagoda was beautiful. Right on the river and clean. Only wish that they had a translation plaque next to the stones. All and all a very nice free garden to walk",
          "I didn't like most of the sculptures, but that is dependent on personal taste. It was nice to walk around with my husband and have something to do though.",
          "The sculpture park is a great place to just sit and even greater when the festivals and food trucks arrive. The sculptures are unique and interesting. I think everyone should see them.",
          "This sculpture park is worth your time to stop. I have been here many times, and never get tired of the works of art. It is especially beautiful at night. I was happy to see an exit for the park off of 235, and the food trucks are there. It would be a great place for lunch!",
          "You have to visit the sculpture park during the day and also at night. My favorite has to be the Kaleidoscope, great place to get special pictures. You have to bring your camera. You can get so many cool pictures. I love to also go at dusk and just sit and watch the people",
          "On a nice day, this would be a fun family activity. Great opportunity to get a little art education on vacation.",
          "The artwork displayed here is predominantly attractive and interesting. It's also very wide open. Overall a should-see if you're in the city. There is an area that I didn't like as much, as it seemed to portray \"spooky\" sculptures. I'm not a personal fan of this, nor do I think",
          "Kids will enjoy these odd sculptures and have fun running around on the grass. It is a great place to have a picnic and The Central Library is also close by (but check library's opening times.) Free fun for all.",
          "After visiting the beautiful classical capitol building, we experienced a total change of perspective by walking through this sculpture park. Very well maintained and presented. We picked up a pamphlet at one end of park and enjoyed our time appreciating the art and artist",
          "Located in the heart of downtown Des Moines, you'll be amazed at these unique sculptures and beautiful park. While you are visiting you can take some really great photos of and with the sculptures and even rent a bicycle to explore more parts of this safe and vibrant city!",
          "Very varied sculpture in a park like setting. another plus is that there are several nice restaurants around the park to have lunch. One can spend more or less time examining the various works depending on your level of interest. A good place for taking photographs.",
          "Visiting this place was a unique and interesting experience in itself. The park is very well maintained and sculptures are unique. Park is open all the time and you can also have a guided tour (call based) if that interests you. It's a small park, easily accessible and right",
          "The sculptures were unique and the park setting made it fun for the entire family. Easy access to the area from downtown.",
          "Open year round. Love it that it is downtown and next to small lunch shops/food trucks. Great to grab a bite and walk around during lunch time.",
          "This is all in about a 2 block space. Nothing exciting except the sculptures are super cool. Make sure you have change for the meters as there doesn't appear to be freee public parking. The sculptures are all unique and it's just a nice little walk in the middle of downtown.",
          "It's a small collection of world class sculptures. I visited on a chilly February day with my young kids who enjoyed walking most of the park before they got bored and I had to get them back in the car before I was done.",
          "Delightful in every way. Great for children an wedding photo opportunities. Everyone should view this treasure. Don't neglect the audio tour available on your cell. Parking was abundant (and free) on this sunny April Saturday.",
          "John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park is in downtown between Grand Ave. and Locust from 13th to 15th streets. There are 27 modern sculptures. Most people like to take picture with Nomade, which was formed by painted stainless steel letters. If you are tired of walking in",
          "Well worth the walk around the garden to view the sculptures. Interesting sculptures and descriptions.",
          "Beautiful walk on a nice day. I'm happy Des Moines has kept some green space downtown and made it interesting with the art. The alphabet head is becoming a DSM icon.",
          "Be prepared to be amazed if you haven't spent time at this site. It is stunning! Not what you may expect of a Midwestern community, but you probably wouldn't find anything like it anywhere.",
          "Pick up a brochure (or not) and enjoy a wonderful 1/2 day walking around the park. The sculpture is fun and highly photogenic. I will return!",
          "I expected a bit more from this sculpture park. I visited in a cloudy day which didn't help. If you have lots of time in Des Moines then it's worth a peek. However, if your time is limited, I would skip it.",
          "While visiting downtown, we like to either drive by or walk through the sculpture park. Its full of curious statues and abstract sculptures that one should see. It is good for a stroll, if you've got a little extra time on your hands.",
          "Everyone should stop in and see the wonderful art work in this park, its a great asset to downtown Des Moines and its close to so many resteraunts. Check it out at sunset if you have time, my favorite time to go.",
          "Definitely come visit the sculpture garden during the fabulous Des Moines Art Festival in June! Unique scuptures donated by John and Mary Pappajohn give the entrance into the city a classy feel. Then stop by Centro for dinner. Across the street, be sure and visit",
          "Des Moines isn't a huge spot for tourists, everyone knows that. If if was, this would be like a mini version of New York central park. Many locals walk around during lunch and on nice weekends many families come out to enjoy the day. Even for people who aren't into art it can be",
          "Excellent afternoon for a walk around the sculpture garden. The brochure is very well done & the sculptures are all wonderful. This is an excellent space in the downtown area.",
          "This is a fun place to walk regardless of month or time of day. The sculpture garden is a great addition to the city and it's a fun place to take out-of-town guests while eating or strolling through downtown.",
          "This sculpture garden is right in the heart of the city. Interesting pieces, and plenty of place to sit, relax, and reflect, as well.",
          "WAlk among these sculptures and ponder the ideas of the sculptors. Enjoy the views of nearby buildings.",

          "The multi-block area has many large and wonderful sculptures. Many of which kids can climb. It's a good place for families or individuals to kill time or to become educated concerning art. It's outside vast, clean and there are a lot of eateries within a stone's throw.",
          "Some of the pieces are genuinely good, like the letter man. But some pieces are just plain garbage. Anything can be art anymore, but that doesn't mean that it is or should be. Good place to stroll on a summer day though.",
          "The Sculpture Park is a great place to walk around with friends or on a date. I live in Des Moines and I come here very often because I always find something new that I like about it. It is not super big (it takes up about a block of space), but the art is great and engaging.",
          "Literally and figuratively the art in Western Gateway Park is accessible. You can touch and interact with the art and the art is discernible. We enjoyed the sculptures and the setting. we were there in june so also enjoyed the Des Moines Art Fair.",
          "It's a very nice sculpture park. It makes for an enjoyable evening stroll. It is a well maintained park and a draw to that area. It looked to me like the area is being re-vitalized. A number of people were there enjoying the park.",

          "I always drive by there and never stop. Today, I stopped and slowly walk by things that have been built. It's beautiful art work. I understand puts art work at his home. That's neat. I think everyone in Des Moines or comes to our city, should go visit the art work there.",
          "Interesting sculptures scattered around this urban art park. A little chilly in winter-best visited in the summer when the grass is green. The Des Moines Art Festival is held in this area later in the summer-a wonderful outing!",
          "I have been all over North America and have not really seen a park as unique as this one. Set along to blocks it has hosted art festivals in the summer time. All the art is very large and some you can actually stand inside. It worth a trip to this location if your in the Des",
          "What a gift the Pappajohns gave to the Des Moines community! A world class sculpture garden in the heart of downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Walk, tour or wander - all are acceptable. There is a free audio tour available. The garden is a round the clock photo opportunity for amateur",

          "This is a great introduction to sculpture for all ages, set in a 4.4-acre green space, with the Des Moines skyline as a backdrop. Food trucks park close by in the summer, so you can sit on a bench, eat a delicious but inexpensive lunch, and watch people and art. Afterward, walk",
          "Well worth your trip if you are even just a casual art fan. World class sculptures are located in a very nice green space. This neighborhood has been undergoing a major transformation and the results are incredible. Private/public partnership is making this an art destination",
          "This is a testament to the ongoing connection between Des Moines French legacy and it's modern metropolis. Weathering the brutal Midwest winters, stands a public art installation of contemporary sculptures of varying media. Worth the walk through year round.",

          "This park is well connected to the downtown area and is a good place to visit while here in Des Moines. It is only a small stroll from any of the downtown hotels and well worth the effort. When I was here they had food trucks surrounding the park, which was an added advantage.",
          "The Pappajohn Sculpture Park is an unexpected treat with its pieces by well-regarded artists in a nicely landscaped green. It is loosely linked to other plazas and a riverside park in downtown Des Moines in a contemporary City Beautiful effort. Together they bring needed open",

          "Garden is easy to access on drive by or walking . On street parking is available. Sculptures themselves are not overly interesting, and none are titled so very hard to understand artists objectives. However, concept is nice addition to downtown, even if I found the art itself",
          "Found this amazing sculpture garden in the heart of Des Moines. Excellent examples of modern sculpture. Very worth a trip downtown. A great way to spend a sunny day in Des Moines.",
          "I had read mixed reviews of this park before arriving in Des Moines -- so I wasn't sure it was worth seeing -- but I asked a local who raved about it and I'm really glad we took the time. What an interesting mix of fascinating pieces and a beautiful setting (plus it's all free",
          "Really good park with beautiful sculptures. There are cell phone tours available and also booklets at the corner of the place. Made really good pictures over there!",

          "I hope that tax revenue was not spent to commission this \"art\". It is better than a big open field I suppose. I am sure some would say that I am just not \"open minded\" enough to understand random scrap metal in various shapes.",

          "A great walk with anyone to see these artists imagination, we typically see this at the arts festival.",
          "Nice amenity in middle of downtown but it did challenge my appreciation of art. Maybe it's the more abstract I got get. My problem, maybe not yours. Glad we walked through and considered them all.",
          "This is about 2 square grass-covered blocks containing about 20 large and very creative sculptures. It's worth the trip---doesn't take very long to see them all---a half-hour or so. But you'll need to get the interpretive brochure somewhere else such as the Des Moines Art",

          "Yes its great that this is free to the public but frankly there is not one sculpture I like (or that anyone else I know likes for that matter) and I can only think the \"artists\" had to give the pieces away they are so awful. Otherwise, there is grass to walk or sit on which is",

          "This is a smaller sculpture park but is very nice. If you park over by the library, you can walk through all the sculpture work. Lots of fun photo opportunities available. Love the quality of the art within the park. For a smaller area this is worth a visit.",

          "The sculpture park is a great place to wander, people watch, and enjoy some interesting sculptures. No, of course you cannot climb on them as they are expensive pieces of art. But there is an audio guide you can download on podcast or you can use the printed guide. Here is a",
          "don't come here. It is not a fun place to bring kids. their is nothing to do expect stand in front of sculptures. You are not allowed on them. i hope never to see or come to this place ever again. Try the art center, science center, Bass pro shop and the botanical gardens.",
          "We wandered through the park and really enjoyed the unique sculptures. My only wish is that there would be more information available at each piece so we would know the name of the art and the artist."

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) quite often. Snowfall averages 35.3 inches (90 cm) per season, and annual precipitation averages 36.0 inches (914 mm), with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city.

        "wiki": "Boone Bridge 2, also known as the Wagon Wheel Bridge, was a historic structure that was located west of Boone, Iowa, United States. It spanned the Des Moines River for 703 feet (214 m). The Boone Commercial Association and the Boone County Board of Supervisors disagreed over the location of a new wagon bridge over the river. The county wanted the new bridge west from Eighth Street in Boone, closer to the Chicago and North Western Railroad's Boone Viaduct. The businessmen wanted to rebuild the Incline Bridge. The dispute was resolved when the Commercial association offered to buy the Incline Bridge. The county contracted with the Iowa Bridge Company to design and build the bridge, which was completed in 1910 for $77,900. The bridge consisted of a long-span Pennsylvania truss over the main channel of the river and three Pratt trusses over the floodplain. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.In March 2016, a span of the bridge collapsed into the Des Moines River after ice from a broken ice jam damaged one of the piers. The bridge was demolished in June 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It was a rainy day - but that was not the only reason I have only a so-so review for this sculpture park. The sculptures seemed simply to be on display - no sense of context or connection in their placement, with people held a distance with a constant 'see but don't touch'",

          "I went to the sculpture park with my art club. It was very enjoyable except for all the bees and wasps.",
          "This is an interesting place to tour but I would not go great lengths to see it. Its about a square block in the downtown of a small city that is spread out. A nice social place for people to gather. Some sculptures were very interesting and others not so much. There is no",

          "My gal was more impressed than I but we were both glad we visited. On our way out of town, we pulled over and parked on the street alongside the park. We fed the meter 20 minutes worth and that's about how long we needed to explore the works. We really appreciate philanthropic",
          "Lots of items to view. Many different mediums. Day we were there they had a wedding party there also taking pictures",
          "Fantastic place for cool photos. Wish there were a few more places to sit or to hangout on the green space.",
          "OMG. It's just wonderful. Full disclosure--back in the 1980s, I worked at the Des Moines Art Center and loved the city. But this is really a new and hoppin' place. But back to the Sculpture Park. It's a grassy set of slopes with important and beautifully sited sculptures. It is",

          "We had gone to the art museum earlier that afternoon and decided to stop by the outdoor sculpture park before leaving town, and we're very glad we did!",
          "So glad our city is trying to build its culture and provide some art abd green spaces. However, the selection of art pieces is atrocious! You have black and white balls, a crazy mean looking rabbit, items that look like kidney beans, again in metal and not pretty. With as much",

          "The park is nicely set up and it was good to stretch the legs a little and walk around to the different sculptures. There are not a lot, but it is free, and according to the sign there is an audio tour you can look up. If you miss it don't worry about it, but if you want a nice",
          "It was fun! I brought my dogs with me and took pictures with the sculptures. They have a lot of sculptures and at night it is all lit up. Parking you have to pay with meter so heads up there. Also a lot of people there playing Pokemon go! I would definitely make it a point to",
          "I'd never been to Des Moines before, so we decided to visit the sculpture park while in the area. On street parking is coin meters. Unfortunately, I didn't have any change with me. The 1st parking garage that I pulled into was also coin metered. I finally found a garage that",

          "People seem to love this place. I've lived in Des Moines for awhile now and never understood the hype. If you like really abstract art then I guess you'd like this place but the art kinda looks like a joke to me. The things they call some of the pieces is ridiculous. The piece",
          "High quality sculptures set outdoors near the west end of downtown Des Moines. Many sculptures by recognized artists. My fave is the metal human form composed of letters of the alphabet. It speaks of our inextricable link with language & symbol. Powerful!",

          "Very nice to visit, especially since it is free! The sculptures were very interesting and thought provoking. You can spend as little or as much time as you want to. We found the park on trip advisors and also an app I have called \"Roadside Attractions\". I felt alittle silly",
          "While the Papajohn Sculpture Park is a great attraction to visit, be warned some of the sculptures are a bit questionable. There are several along Grand Avenue resembling giant spiders & larvae. Strange yet worth the visit assuming you go with low expectations. As compared to",

          "The sculptures are awesome! My boyfriend is not very big into art, but he loved it! The alphabet head is very cool. You can walk right into it, it's huge! The mirror/color exhibit is awesome! You can see about 20 reflections of yourself. It made for some really nice pictures.",
          "This was a very interesting sculpture garden with some very distinctive sculptures. My favorite was the head made out of the alphabet which was big enough to walk inside of it.",
          "Visited the park in the daylight and then returned at night to see that several sculptures were more interesting during the evening.",
          "Neat little park. The kids enjoyed stretching their legs and running around. There was plenty of metered parking along both sides. It was $0.45 for 1 hour. There were also some restaurants right around the park you could grab food at. I don't think it's something we'd do again,",
          "Spent an easy hour meandering the park. Someone has more creative ability than I. Take a camera, and stretch your imagination.",
          "I absolutely loved seeing this place! All the sculptures are a sight to see. So beautiful! My kids enjoyed running around while I was able to enjoy the art.",
          "One square block of large sculptures with a small plaque identifying the artist, year and name of the piece. Some of the pieces are interactive and kids seemed to be enjoying their time there. Plenty of green space to sit and enjoy the view. Wide walking path around and through",
          "This was an interesting and pleasant sculpture park in downtown Des Moines. Interactive interesting sculptures and it is free to visit. There are concerts in the park in the summer.",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Wished I would have known or at least ventured downtown more often when I lived in West Des Moines a few years back so I could see what has changed through the years. My favorite was the horses made from driftwood .",
          "We are traveling from Texas on a Midwest road trip and found this park on a list of things to do in Iowa. Our visit was on a Tuesday evening around 7:30PM which was very pleasant weather wise to be out strolling in the park. The sculptures were interesting and trying to figure",

          "This free park in downtown Des Moines is a pleasant way to spend 10 minutes or 2 hours. There are more than 20 sculptures with winding sidewalks wandering between them. All sculptures are modern art, so if you're looking for a Rodin better head to the Des Moines Art Center. But",
          "The term world-class gets thrown about a lot and often, without merit. The sculptures in this park are truly world-class and by world renowned artists.",
          "Iowa has been great! The sculpture park and the Art Festival was a nice way to spend Saturday. Plenty of people and detailed works of art to enjoy. Children rolling down the hills brought back memories of my childhood home.",
          "This is an easy park to walk around and catch great sculptures/photos on your trip. We went with young children and teens and they LOVED it!!! Beautiful and quirky exhibits and the same time-but all very fun.",
          "A lovely park in downtown Des Moines with interesting sculptures providing an opportunity to leisurely walk around and take in the scene.",
          "I have been to this outdoor exhibit a few times and have seen something different each time. My favorite is the Nomade. Make sure you look at Moonrise from the correct angle. In downtown Des Moines, there are great restaurants nearby. It makes a nice afternoon.",
          "This is a wonderful addition to the city. We enjoyed a casual stroll to and through the garden. Not too abstract so great for a part time art viewer.",
          "This is a downtown art park. Sculptures are interesting and impressive. Plan to spend at least a couple of hours if you really want to enjoy the park. Worth the trip if you are already in the area.",

          "The City of Des Moines has outdone itself in making this homage to the sculptural arts possible. The sculptures are varied. The setting is sublime. This park creates a gateway to the city that took years to establish. It was well worth the wait.",
          "This is a great place to people watch or relax. There are several sculptures to look at (it seems more are added monthly). Right now, it's not crowded with art so there is lots of green space plus places to sit.",

          "I visited on an amazing weather day. This park as beautiful sculptures in it, and they are spread out across a huge lawn so you have enough space to admire them without bumping into anyone. There were even people lying under trees enjoying the weather. I was happy to see that",
          "This is a nice place to check out while in Des Moines. There is metered parking all around the park so make sure you have some quarters! The sculptures are well done and spread out over a large area. There is no cost to view the sculptures.",
          "There are some neat sculptures, but it's in a small area, and it's not a place I would visit more then once",
          "If you are downtown you can't miss seeing this park. Modern rabbits sit around ( like one at Washington University in St Louis) and horse like sculptures amid other larger sculptures look strangely at home together in this urban park. It is interesting to walk among the art",
          "This park was located in downtown and was near some other things we went to see. It is totally worth a half hour of time to walk around it and to see the cool sculptures.",
          "You can stroll through this park leisurely and read the provided guided tour booklet to truly understand the works of art and the artists' visions. Or you can let your kids run through the park and pose by their favorite sculpture. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy this",
          "It was a beautiful day to be outside and the walk through the slightly winding path of the Pappajohn Sculpture Park was a perfect setting. There is no admission and no gates that interfere with the beautiful pathways. The park hosts a collection of widely varying sculptures.",
          "Creative and interesting sculpture park just on the outskirts of the downtown core of Des Moines. It's a relatively small park that's easy to walk around, and the sculptures are curious, even enigmatic.",

          "My husband and I went to college in Des Moines in the 90's. We have made a few trips back and this sculpture park is unique and a lovely addition to the downtown. It makes for some cool photo ops! Highly recommend a stop. It's a quick jaunt, or take a picnic and lounge!",
          "My husband & I visited here on his business trip. Beautiful garden and easy walk and informational. The sculptures and pagoda was beautiful. Right on the river and clean. Only wish that they had a translation plaque next to the stones. All and all a very nice free garden to walk",
          "I didn't like most of the sculptures, but that is dependent on personal taste. It was nice to walk around with my husband and have something to do though.",
          "The sculpture park is a great place to just sit and even greater when the festivals and food trucks arrive. The sculptures are unique and interesting. I think everyone should see them.",
          "This sculpture park is worth your time to stop. I have been here many times, and never get tired of the works of art. It is especially beautiful at night. I was happy to see an exit for the park off of 235, and the food trucks are there. It would be a great place for lunch!",
          "You have to visit the sculpture park during the day and also at night. My favorite has to be the Kaleidoscope, great place to get special pictures. You have to bring your camera. You can get so many cool pictures. I love to also go at dusk and just sit and watch the people",
          "On a nice day, this would be a fun family activity. Great opportunity to get a little art education on vacation.",
          "The artwork displayed here is predominantly attractive and interesting. It's also very wide open. Overall a should-see if you're in the city. There is an area that I didn't like as much, as it seemed to portray \"spooky\" sculptures. I'm not a personal fan of this, nor do I think",
          "Kids will enjoy these odd sculptures and have fun running around on the grass. It is a great place to have a picnic and The Central Library is also close by (but check library's opening times.) Free fun for all.",
          "After visiting the beautiful classical capitol building, we experienced a total change of perspective by walking through this sculpture park. Very well maintained and presented. We picked up a pamphlet at one end of park and enjoyed our time appreciating the art and artist",
          "Located in the heart of downtown Des Moines, you'll be amazed at these unique sculptures and beautiful park. While you are visiting you can take some really great photos of and with the sculptures and even rent a bicycle to explore more parts of this safe and vibrant city!",
          "Very varied sculpture in a park like setting. another plus is that there are several nice restaurants around the park to have lunch. One can spend more or less time examining the various works depending on your level of interest. A good place for taking photographs.",
          "Visiting this place was a unique and interesting experience in itself. The park is very well maintained and sculptures are unique. Park is open all the time and you can also have a guided tour (call based) if that interests you. It's a small park, easily accessible and right",
          "The sculptures were unique and the park setting made it fun for the entire family. Easy access to the area from downtown.",
          "Open year round. Love it that it is downtown and next to small lunch shops/food trucks. Great to grab a bite and walk around during lunch time.",
          "This is all in about a 2 block space. Nothing exciting except the sculptures are super cool. Make sure you have change for the meters as there doesn't appear to be freee public parking. The sculptures are all unique and it's just a nice little walk in the middle of downtown.",
          "It's a small collection of world class sculptures. I visited on a chilly February day with my young kids who enjoyed walking most of the park before they got bored and I had to get them back in the car before I was done.",
          "Delightful in every way. Great for children an wedding photo opportunities. Everyone should view this treasure. Don't neglect the audio tour available on your cell. Parking was abundant (and free) on this sunny April Saturday.",
          "John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park is in downtown between Grand Ave. and Locust from 13th to 15th streets. There are 27 modern sculptures. Most people like to take picture with Nomade, which was formed by painted stainless steel letters. If you are tired of walking in",
          "Well worth the walk around the garden to view the sculptures. Interesting sculptures and descriptions.",
          "Beautiful walk on a nice day. I'm happy Des Moines has kept some green space downtown and made it interesting with the art. The alphabet head is becoming a DSM icon.",
          "Be prepared to be amazed if you haven't spent time at this site. It is stunning! Not what you may expect of a Midwestern community, but you probably wouldn't find anything like it anywhere.",
          "Pick up a brochure (or not) and enjoy a wonderful 1/2 day walking around the park. The sculpture is fun and highly photogenic. I will return!",
          "I expected a bit more from this sculpture park. I visited in a cloudy day which didn't help. If you have lots of time in Des Moines then it's worth a peek. However, if your time is limited, I would skip it.",
          "While visiting downtown, we like to either drive by or walk through the sculpture park. Its full of curious statues and abstract sculptures that one should see. It is good for a stroll, if you've got a little extra time on your hands.",
          "Everyone should stop in and see the wonderful art work in this park, its a great asset to downtown Des Moines and its close to so many resteraunts. Check it out at sunset if you have time, my favorite time to go.",
          "Definitely come visit the sculpture garden during the fabulous Des Moines Art Festival in June! Unique scuptures donated by John and Mary Pappajohn give the entrance into the city a classy feel. Then stop by Centro for dinner. Across the street, be sure and visit",
          "Des Moines isn't a huge spot for tourists, everyone knows that. If if was, this would be like a mini version of New York central park. Many locals walk around during lunch and on nice weekends many families come out to enjoy the day. Even for people who aren't into art it can be",
          "Excellent afternoon for a walk around the sculpture garden. The brochure is very well done & the sculptures are all wonderful. This is an excellent space in the downtown area.",
          "This is a fun place to walk regardless of month or time of day. The sculpture garden is a great addition to the city and it's a fun place to take out-of-town guests while eating or strolling through downtown.",
          "This sculpture garden is right in the heart of the city. Interesting pieces, and plenty of place to sit, relax, and reflect, as well.",
          "WAlk among these sculptures and ponder the ideas of the sculptors. Enjoy the views of nearby buildings.",

          "The multi-block area has many large and wonderful sculptures. Many of which kids can climb. It's a good place for families or individuals to kill time or to become educated concerning art. It's outside vast, clean and there are a lot of eateries within a stone's throw.",
          "Some of the pieces are genuinely good, like the letter man. But some pieces are just plain garbage. Anything can be art anymore, but that doesn't mean that it is or should be. Good place to stroll on a summer day though.",
          "The Sculpture Park is a great place to walk around with friends or on a date. I live in Des Moines and I come here very often because I always find something new that I like about it. It is not super big (it takes up about a block of space), but the art is great and engaging.",
          "Literally and figuratively the art in Western Gateway Park is accessible. You can touch and interact with the art and the art is discernible. We enjoyed the sculptures and the setting. we were there in june so also enjoyed the Des Moines Art Fair.",
          "It's a very nice sculpture park. It makes for an enjoyable evening stroll. It is a well maintained park and a draw to that area. It looked to me like the area is being re-vitalized. A number of people were there enjoying the park.",

          "I always drive by there and never stop. Today, I stopped and slowly walk by things that have been built. It's beautiful art work. I understand puts art work at his home. That's neat. I think everyone in Des Moines or comes to our city, should go visit the art work there.",
          "Interesting sculptures scattered around this urban art park. A little chilly in winter-best visited in the summer when the grass is green. The Des Moines Art Festival is held in this area later in the summer-a wonderful outing!",
          "I have been all over North America and have not really seen a park as unique as this one. Set along to blocks it has hosted art festivals in the summer time. All the art is very large and some you can actually stand inside. It worth a trip to this location if your in the Des",
          "What a gift the Pappajohns gave to the Des Moines community! A world class sculpture garden in the heart of downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Walk, tour or wander - all are acceptable. There is a free audio tour available. The garden is a round the clock photo opportunity for amateur",

          "We went in Oct. on a beautiful fall day. Does Moines has put so much time, effort and money into their downtown. It is an attraction for everyone. The sculpture garden was serene, colorful and very unique. The photo ops are amazing. No touching the sculptures but...",

          "This is a great introduction to sculpture for all ages, set in a 4.4-acre green space, with the Des Moines skyline as a backdrop. Food trucks park close by in the summer, so you can sit on a bench, eat a delicious but inexpensive lunch, and watch people and art. Afterward, walk",
          "Well worth your trip if you are even just a casual art fan. World class sculptures are located in a very nice green space. This neighborhood has been undergoing a major transformation and the results are incredible. Private/public partnership is making this an art destination",
          "This is a testament to the ongoing connection between Des Moines French legacy and it's modern metropolis. Weathering the brutal Midwest winters, stands a public art installation of contemporary sculptures of varying media. Worth the walk through year round.",

          "This park is well connected to the downtown area and is a good place to visit while here in Des Moines. It is only a small stroll from any of the downtown hotels and well worth the effort. When I was here they had food trucks surrounding the park, which was an added advantage.",
          "The Pappajohn Sculpture Park is an unexpected treat with its pieces by well-regarded artists in a nicely landscaped green. It is loosely linked to other plazas and a riverside park in downtown Des Moines in a contemporary City Beautiful effort. Together they bring needed open",

          "Garden is easy to access on drive by or walking . On street parking is available. Sculptures themselves are not overly interesting, and none are titled so very hard to understand artists objectives. However, concept is nice addition to downtown, even if I found the art itself",
          "Found this amazing sculpture garden in the heart of Des Moines. Excellent examples of modern sculpture. Very worth a trip downtown. A great way to spend a sunny day in Des Moines.",
          "I had read mixed reviews of this park before arriving in Des Moines -- so I wasn't sure it was worth seeing -- but I asked a local who raved about it and I'm really glad we took the time. What an interesting mix of fascinating pieces and a beautiful setting (plus it's all free",

          "I hope that tax revenue was not spent to commission this \"art\". It is better than a big open field I suppose. I am sure some would say that I am just not \"open minded\" enough to understand random scrap metal in various shapes.",

          "A great walk with anyone to see these artists imagination, we typically see this at the arts festival.",
          "Nice amenity in middle of downtown but it did challenge my appreciation of art. Maybe it's the more abstract I got get. My problem, maybe not yours. Glad we walked through and considered them all.",
          "This is about 2 square grass-covered blocks containing about 20 large and very creative sculptures. It's worth the trip---doesn't take very long to see them all---a half-hour or so. But you'll need to get the interpretive brochure somewhere else such as the Des Moines Art",

          "I live opposite the sculpture park (and have done for the past year). The park is a great place for a wander in the summer months, either during the week early morning (6 am) or in the evening. I'm a keen amateur photographer and love taking pictures at sunrise and sunset with",
          "Loved t! I would go at night to see the sculptures when they are lit. Jaume Plensa's piece is certainly the highlight!",

          "Yes its great that this is free to the public but frankly there is not one sculpture I like (or that anyone else I know likes for that matter) and I can only think the \"artists\" had to give the pieces away they are so awful. Otherwise, there is grass to walk or sit on which is",
          "This park is one block long and one narrow block wide. Beautiful park with metal and composite sculptures throughout the park. This is a terrific place to take the kids or to just walk around the park and looking at the sculptures. A few are pretty wild but most are",

          "This is a smaller sculpture park but is very nice. If you park over by the library, you can walk through all the sculpture work. Lots of fun photo opportunities available. Love the quality of the art within the park. For a smaller area this is worth a visit.",

          "We had hoped to park the car and wander but did the slow crawl by as a concert had closed the park and there were no parks handy. What we saw was great and well worth the trip into Des Moines, maybe next time we will get to see them close up.",
          "This large, magnificently carpeted-with-lawn, park provides a wonderful - and surprising - setting for a well-selected collection of large-scale art works, ranging from pure abstract to whimsical to outre to humorous. Our visit was on a warm, sunny day. A 45-minute stroll let",

          "This isn't really an attraction so much as an area you might go for a walk or to relax if you are walking about downtown Des Moines. It's an alright place, but don't expect anything breath-taking. Getting There: Parking is fairly easy to come by in this area, even just on",
          "Since I am obsessed with my Fitbit and meeting my daily goal for steps this park was on my list. I visited on a gorgeous spring day and walked from downtown. It's a really nice free attraction that would be a great place to let kids run around and burn off some energy while",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) quite often. Snowfall averages 35.3 inches (90 cm) per season, and annual precipitation averages 36.0 inches (914 mm), with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203,433 people, 81,369 households, and 47,491 families residing in the city.

The Abbot of Sherborne Abbey used this house as his prebendal residence in Salisbury prior to 1539, when Sherborne Abbey was decommissioned during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. At that time the house was known as Sherborne Palace. The administration of estates of religious houses seized in the Reformation was carried out by the Augmentation Court. Both this office and the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury Cathedral laid claim to the property; after much court wrangling the Dean and Chapter succeeded and still hold the freehold today.\n\n\n=== 15th\u201316th century ===\nThe original house was considerably restructured in the 15th century and replaced with part of the present building. The 15th-century construction can be seen as the central frontage with three gables, and a porch which is thought to date to the 13th century. The building at that time would have had a great hall open to the roof, a parlour with a chamber above, service rooms and a kitchen. The original facing was decorated with flint rubble and herringbone tile courses. The original windows were of Ham Hill stone and traces of these are visible on the frontage. The porch vaulting is also of Ham Hill stone, which is rare in buildings in Salisbury but common in Sherborne which implies that the work was carried out in the Sherborne Abbey's tenancy. The oak entrance door inside the porch, with small wicket leaf and strap hinges, is thought to be original. Later extensions have been added to the north and south. There are smoke louvre trusses in the roof and original fireplaces in several rooms.In the 16th century, the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury Cathedral let the house to a number of secular tenants. Around that period the north end of the house was extended with a large brick cross-wing, out of proportion to the original house. This extension has two large mullioned and transomed windows and a staircase from the ground floor to the attic, with oak balustrades around two newel posts. Two of the rooms have elaborately decorated plaster ceilings. This work was carried out under the direction of the tenants Thomas and Eleanor Sadler; Thomas was Registrar to the Bishops of Sarum. It is quite probable that it was in these rooms that King James 1 and his wife, Anne of Denmark, were entertained when they visited in 1610 and 1613.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nThomas Sadler (Jr.) and his wife entertained the antiquary John Aubrey at the house in 1656.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn the 18th century the tenancy was held by the Beach family who sublet the property in smaller units. One of the tenants during this time was Lieutenant General Henry Shrapnel, inventor of the fragmenting artillery shell. Shrapnel is recorded as living at the house in 1785 which coincides closely with the time that he developed the shell. Further evidence of his activities comes from a description given in 1836 by a lady who attended the Godolphin School there. In another part of the building was a ladies' school run by a Mrs Smith from 1767 until she retired in 1781. Another school, under the direction of a Mrs Vazey, also used the building at that time.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1803 the house reverted to single occupancy for a short period, during which the tenancy was held by Sir John Slade from 1808\u20131852, although he ceased living there from 1829. Slade made a number of alterations including removing windows and adding buttresses to the east front, using the Abbot\u2019s Room as the main entrance and adding a reeded white marble chimney piece to the fireplace. In 1837 the house was sub-divided again and occupied by a Mr Henry Brodribb, a solicitor and Miss Margaret Bazley (or Bazeley), headmistress of the Godolphin School, which was then housed in nearby Arundells. In 1837 the Godolphin School moved into the King's House and was transferred in 1848 when an outbreak of cholera in the city forced its evacuation to premises on Milford Hill in another part of Salisbury.In 1849, further renovations included constructing a linking passage along the west fa\u00e7ade which effectively hid the original 15th century exterior. In 1850, T. H. Wyatt removed the buttresses from the east face and restored the windows in Elizabethan form.From its vacancy by the Godolphin School the King's House was used to accommodate the Diocesan Training College for Schoolmistresses. In 1873 an extension to the building was constructed to the design of Edward Doran Webb to provide dormitories, and in 1899 a further extension for a chapel, along with the installation of electricity and heating. In the window of the former chapel is a stained glass representation by Kempe of the gartered arms of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales who had visited the house with his father in 1610 but had died before his father's second visit in 1613. This room is now used to display ceramics. It was here at The Diocesan Training College that Thomas Hardy's sisters Kate and Mary were trained, perhaps inspiring the attendance and escape from the Melchester (Salisbury) college of Sue Bridehead in Jude the Obscure, wherein the college is described.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1966 the college became The College of Sarum St Michael, which closed in 1978, and a 125-year tenancy was taken up by the Salisbury Museum, which moved into the building and opened its doors to the public in 1981.\n\n\n== Copy of the house ==\nIn 1922 a wealthy American cosmetics manufacturer, Carl Weeks and his wife, Edith were impressed with the King's House, and instructed their architects, William Whitney Rasmussen, Byron Boyd and Herbert Moore to construct a similar family house in Des Moines,  Iowa. The architects visited Salisbury, took details and arranged the purchase of authentic fittings locally, including stairs, fireplaces, panelling, flooring and other materials; many items were taken from 91 Crane Street, Salisbury.  The project cost $1,500,000 for the building and $1,500,000 for furnishings, and took five years to complete. Now called Salisbury House, the Des Moines house is operated as a museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Lake City Community Memorial Building is a historic structure located in Lake City, Iowa, United States.  The building was built as a memorial to those who served in the American Civil War, the Spanish\u2013American War, and World War I. It was a project of the women in the Lake City Civic Improvement Society, a Progressive Era organization that exemplified civic involvement and community cohesion. They provided the funding while the city council was responsible for its development. The two-story, brick Neoclassical structure was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson, and it was built by Arthur H. Neumann & Co., also of Des Moines. The main auditorium sat 750 people, and had a stage on the north side. It has subsequently been removed to increase the seating capacity. There was also a room for the city council chambers, which no longer meets here, a Memorial Room for use by the American Legion, kitchen facilities, and a women's meeting room. Across the top of the main facade are three limestone panels with the words \"Soldiers,\" \"Sailors,\" and \"Marines\" inscribed on them. In the arches above the three doors are inscriptions of the names of important battlegrounds from the three wars. Above the first door are: \"Shiloh, Gettysburg, Antietam;\" above the second, \"Santiago, Manila, San Juan;\" and above the third, \"St. Mihiel, Argonne, Chateau Thierry.\" The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie.

The park commissioners purchased the land on April 21, 1894.\nThe Principal Riverwalk is a riverwalk park district being constructed along the banks of the Des Moines River in the downtown. Primarily funded by the Principal Financial Group, the Riverwalk is a multi-year jointly funded project also funded by the city and state. Upon completion, it will feature a 1.2-mile (1.9 km) recreational trail connecting the east and west sides of downtown via two pedestrian bridges. A landscaped promenade along the street level is planned. The Riverwalk includes the downtown Brenton Skating Plaza, open from November through March.\nGray's Lake, part of the 167 acres (68 ha) of Gray's Lake Park, features a boat rental facility, fishing pier, floating boardwalks, and a park resource center. Located just south of the downtown, the centerpiece of the park is a lighted 1.9-mile (3.1 km) Kruidenier Trail, encircling it entirely.\nFrom downtown Des Moines primarily along the east bank of the Des Moines River, the Neil Smith and John Pat Dorrian Trails are 28.2-mile (45.4 km) paved recreational trails that connect Gray's Lake northward to the east shore of Saylorville Lake, Big Creek State Park, and the recreational trails of Ankeny including the High Trestle Trail.

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie.

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie.

          "We had a little free time and wanted to experience this whimsical park. The hardest part of visiting this park was finding street parking. There is an online map that identifies all 31 sculptures. It was a fairly hot day so we didn't take time to listen to the 1 to 4 minute",
          "The sculpture park is about 2 city block rectangle. Some very interesting artwork to be seen. Fun to see if you can find your initials together on the largest of the pieces and probably the centerpiece of the park. I found mine! Worth a quick walk around.",
          "If you go through Des Moines and it is nice out, go to this park. It was a beautiful evening when we went. Lots of families enjoying the evening and checking out all of the beautiful sculptures within the park. I just wished we would have brought dinner so we could have stayed",

          "With this being our first time in Des Moines, our host wanted to show us downtown where the World Food & Music Festival was in progress. On the way, we walked along a sidewalk with a long green to our right on which there were a number of avant-garde sculptures befitting a",

          "It was a very hot day, so that didn't help in our enjoyment. Plus, we have been to many sculpture parks, so this one was a total disappointment. If you haven't been to a sculpture park, then it would be ok. We made a special stop to see this and I was so sad that it was just",

          "The sculpture garden has a wide variety of art in which you can view at your own pace. Most sculptures have an identification plaque and contains a number for an audio tour which you access through your phone. I\u2019m not very artsy but my 10year old & I had a fun time guessing",
          "Favorite sculptures were Ancient forest and Juno From a distance some of the sculptures don\u2019t seem as impressive as when you are standing near them. The sculptures don\u2019t have individual placards so you definitely want to get a map that has the sculptures names and descriptions.",

          "This is an interesting place to tour but I would not go great lengths to see it. Its about a square block in the downtown of a small city that is spread out. A nice social place for people to gather. Some sculptures were very interesting and others not so much. There is no",

          "This is a fun park with lots of neat sculptures. I liked the one with all the different colored glass that you can go inside. However, people really just go to catch lots of Pokemon. There were 4 lures in he park when I went, and the park was swarming with parents and kids",
          "We had been going down to the sculpture park for several weekends now. It is always clean and maintained.",

          "We toured the sculpture garden with friends and it was a nice venue to walk and talk but not overly impressive. It's good it is free and for that, I would recommend at least one visit.",
          "My gal was more impressed than I but we were both glad we visited. On our way out of town, we pulled over and parked on the street alongside the park. We fed the meter 20 minutes worth and that's about how long we needed to explore the works. We really appreciate philanthropic",
          "Lots of items to view. Many different mediums. Day we were there they had a wedding party there also taking pictures",
          "Fantastic place for cool photos. Wish there were a few more places to sit or to hangout on the green space.",
          "OMG. It's just wonderful. Full disclosure--back in the 1980s, I worked at the Des Moines Art Center and loved the city. But this is really a new and hoppin' place. But back to the Sculpture Park. It's a grassy set of slopes with important and beautifully sited sculptures. It is",
          "very close to downtown Des Moines. I liked seeing the new copper library and then the park. I had good Vietnamese food afterwards at A Dong",

          "The Pappajohn family had all of these sculptures in their yard and donated them to the City for the sculpture walk. It's definitely worth the walk thru the park - each sculpture is totally unique and one of a kind.",
          "We had gone to the art museum earlier that afternoon and decided to stop by the outdoor sculpture park before leaving town, and we're very glad we did!",
          "So glad our city is trying to build its culture and provide some art abd green spaces. However, the selection of art pieces is atrocious! You have black and white balls, a crazy mean looking rabbit, items that look like kidney beans, again in metal and not pretty. With as much",
          "Lots of great areas to sit and relax while the kids ran around catching Pokemon. Lots of families enjoying the park and spending time together. The kids had lots of fun and we were able to relax under a shade tree.",
          "My wife and I went there to check out the art. Our two kids (11 and 13) were there for Pokemon Go. My guess is that about 20% were there for art, 80% for Pokemon Go. Which was fine with us; it was good to see so many people at the attraction compared to the last time we were",
          "Thanks to John & Mary Pappajohn Des Moines has an A rated sculpture garden. Relaxing. Excellent variety of grade A pieces. Surrounded by nice eating establishments. Come yourself and place to be Des Moines proud with out of town guests!",

          "The park is nicely set up and it was good to stretch the legs a little and walk around to the different sculptures. There are not a lot, but it is free, and according to the sign there is an audio tour you can look up. If you miss it don't worry about it, but if you want a nice",
          "It was fun! I brought my dogs with me and took pictures with the sculptures. They have a lot of sculptures and at night it is all lit up. Parking you have to pay with meter so heads up there. Also a lot of people there playing Pokemon go! I would definitely make it a point to",
          "I'd never been to Des Moines before, so we decided to visit the sculpture park while in the area. On street parking is coin meters. Unfortunately, I didn't have any change with me. The 1st parking garage that I pulled into was also coin metered. I finally found a garage that",

          "I'm not much into the avant-garde and modernist art thing. I'm told it is a great sculpture park. There a several pieces there I just don't get, but then again, I'm not an art person. The green space is very nice. In a nice area and well maintained. It's a nice place to walk",
          "There are so many neat and different sculptures in a space that is big enough that it's not crowded, but yet small enough that you can see everything. Plenty of photo ops and very easy to get around, even for those that have difficulty walking.",
          "People seem to love this place. I've lived in Des Moines for awhile now and never understood the hype. If you like really abstract art then I guess you'd like this place but the art kinda looks like a joke to me. The things they call some of the pieces is ridiculous. The piece",
          "High quality sculptures set outdoors near the west end of downtown Des Moines. Many sculptures by recognized artists. My fave is the metal human form composed of letters of the alphabet. It speaks of our inextricable link with language & symbol. Powerful!",

          "Very nice to visit, especially since it is free! The sculptures were very interesting and thought provoking. You can spend as little or as much time as you want to. We found the park on trip advisors and also an app I have called \"Roadside Attractions\". I felt alittle silly",
          "While the Papajohn Sculpture Park is a great attraction to visit, be warned some of the sculptures are a bit questionable. There are several along Grand Avenue resembling giant spiders & larvae. Strange yet worth the visit assuming you go with low expectations. As compared to",

          "Visited the park in the daylight and then returned at night to see that several sculptures were more interesting during the evening.",
          "Neat little park. The kids enjoyed stretching their legs and running around. There was plenty of metered parking along both sides. It was $0.45 for 1 hour. There were also some restaurants right around the park you could grab food at. I don't think it's something we'd do again,",

          "This park was located in downtown and was near some other things we went to see. It is totally worth a half hour of time to walk around it and to see the cool sculptures.",
          "You can stroll through this park leisurely and read the provided guided tour booklet to truly understand the works of art and the artists' visions. Or you can let your kids run through the park and pose by their favorite sculpture. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy this",
          "It was a beautiful day to be outside and the walk through the slightly winding path of the Pappajohn Sculpture Park was a perfect setting. There is no admission and no gates that interfere with the beautiful pathways. The park hosts a collection of widely varying sculptures.",
          "Creative and interesting sculpture park just on the outskirts of the downtown core of Des Moines. It's a relatively small park that's easy to walk around, and the sculptures are curious, even enigmatic.",
          "Very unique stop! Even if you don't like abstract or other forms of art, there is something for everyone here!",
          "My husband and I went to college in Des Moines in the 90's. We have made a few trips back and this sculpture park is unique and a lovely addition to the downtown. It makes for some cool photo ops! Highly recommend a stop. It's a quick jaunt, or take a picnic and lounge!",
          "My husband & I visited here on his business trip. Beautiful garden and easy walk and informational. The sculptures and pagoda was beautiful. Right on the river and clean. Only wish that they had a translation plaque next to the stones. All and all a very nice free garden to walk",
          "I didn't like most of the sculptures, but that is dependent on personal taste. It was nice to walk around with my husband and have something to do though.",
          "The sculpture park is a great place to just sit and even greater when the festivals and food trucks arrive. The sculptures are unique and interesting. I think everyone should see them.",
          "This sculpture park is worth your time to stop. I have been here many times, and never get tired of the works of art. It is especially beautiful at night. I was happy to see an exit for the park off of 235, and the food trucks are there. It would be a great place for lunch!",
          "You have to visit the sculpture park during the day and also at night. My favorite has to be the Kaleidoscope, great place to get special pictures. You have to bring your camera. You can get so many cool pictures. I love to also go at dusk and just sit and watch the people",
          "On a nice day, this would be a fun family activity. Great opportunity to get a little art education on vacation.",
          "The artwork displayed here is predominantly attractive and interesting. It's also very wide open. Overall a should-see if you're in the city. There is an area that I didn't like as much, as it seemed to portray \"spooky\" sculptures. I'm not a personal fan of this, nor do I think",
          "Kids will enjoy these odd sculptures and have fun running around on the grass. It is a great place to have a picnic and The Central Library is also close by (but check library's opening times.) Free fun for all.",
          "After visiting the beautiful classical capitol building, we experienced a total change of perspective by walking through this sculpture park. Very well maintained and presented. We picked up a pamphlet at one end of park and enjoyed our time appreciating the art and artist",
          "Located in the heart of downtown Des Moines, you'll be amazed at these unique sculptures and beautiful park. While you are visiting you can take some really great photos of and with the sculptures and even rent a bicycle to explore more parts of this safe and vibrant city!",
          "Very varied sculpture in a park like setting. another plus is that there are several nice restaurants around the park to have lunch. One can spend more or less time examining the various works depending on your level of interest. A good place for taking photographs.",
          "Visiting this place was a unique and interesting experience in itself. The park is very well maintained and sculptures are unique. Park is open all the time and you can also have a guided tour (call based) if that interests you. It's a small park, easily accessible and right",
          "The sculptures were unique and the park setting made it fun for the entire family. Easy access to the area from downtown.",
          "Open year round. Love it that it is downtown and next to small lunch shops/food trucks. Great to grab a bite and walk around during lunch time.",
          "This is all in about a 2 block space. Nothing exciting except the sculptures are super cool. Make sure you have change for the meters as there doesn't appear to be freee public parking. The sculptures are all unique and it's just a nice little walk in the middle of downtown.",
          "It's a small collection of world class sculptures. I visited on a chilly February day with my young kids who enjoyed walking most of the park before they got bored and I had to get them back in the car before I was done.",
          "Delightful in every way. Great for children an wedding photo opportunities. Everyone should view this treasure. Don't neglect the audio tour available on your cell. Parking was abundant (and free) on this sunny April Saturday.",
          "John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park is in downtown between Grand Ave. and Locust from 13th to 15th streets. There are 27 modern sculptures. Most people like to take picture with Nomade, which was formed by painted stainless steel letters. If you are tired of walking in",
          "Well worth the walk around the garden to view the sculptures. Interesting sculptures and descriptions.",
          "Beautiful walk on a nice day. I'm happy Des Moines has kept some green space downtown and made it interesting with the art. The alphabet head is becoming a DSM icon.",
          "Be prepared to be amazed if you haven't spent time at this site. It is stunning! Not what you may expect of a Midwestern community, but you probably wouldn't find anything like it anywhere.",
          "Pick up a brochure (or not) and enjoy a wonderful 1/2 day walking around the park. The sculpture is fun and highly photogenic. I will return!",
          "I expected a bit more from this sculpture park. I visited in a cloudy day which didn't help. If you have lots of time in Des Moines then it's worth a peek. However, if your time is limited, I would skip it.",
          "While visiting downtown, we like to either drive by or walk through the sculpture park. Its full of curious statues and abstract sculptures that one should see. It is good for a stroll, if you've got a little extra time on your hands.",
          "Everyone should stop in and see the wonderful art work in this park, its a great asset to downtown Des Moines and its close to so many resteraunts. Check it out at sunset if you have time, my favorite time to go.",
          "Definitely come visit the sculpture garden during the fabulous Des Moines Art Festival in June! Unique scuptures donated by John and Mary Pappajohn give the entrance into the city a classy feel. Then stop by Centro for dinner. Across the street, be sure and visit",
          "Des Moines isn't a huge spot for tourists, everyone knows that. If if was, this would be like a mini version of New York central park. Many locals walk around during lunch and on nice weekends many families come out to enjoy the day. Even for people who aren't into art it can be",
          "Excellent afternoon for a walk around the sculpture garden. The brochure is very well done & the sculptures are all wonderful. This is an excellent space in the downtown area.",
          "This is a fun place to walk regardless of month or time of day. The sculpture garden is a great addition to the city and it's a fun place to take out-of-town guests while eating or strolling through downtown.",
          "This sculpture garden is right in the heart of the city. Interesting pieces, and plenty of place to sit, relax, and reflect, as well.",
          "WAlk among these sculptures and ponder the ideas of the sculptors. Enjoy the views of nearby buildings.",
          "One sunny day I had some time so I walked through the park and took many pictures. I enjoyed a bench to sit on and took in the whole experience. A very beautiful experience.",
          "Who doesn't enjoy looking at art especially huge and unusual art pieces . Get a little exercise as you walk around the park. It's a win win!",
          "The multi-block area has many large and wonderful sculptures. Many of which kids can climb. It's a good place for families or individuals to kill time or to become educated concerning art. It's outside vast, clean and there are a lot of eateries within a stone's throw.",
          "Some of the pieces are genuinely good, like the letter man. But some pieces are just plain garbage. Anything can be art anymore, but that doesn't mean that it is or should be. Good place to stroll on a summer day though.",
          "The Sculpture Park is a great place to walk around with friends or on a date. I live in Des Moines and I come here very often because I always find something new that I like about it. It is not super big (it takes up about a block of space), but the art is great and engaging.",
          "Literally and figuratively the art in Western Gateway Park is accessible. You can touch and interact with the art and the art is discernible. We enjoyed the sculptures and the setting. we were there in june so also enjoyed the Des Moines Art Fair.",
          "It's a very nice sculpture park. It makes for an enjoyable evening stroll. It is a well maintained park and a draw to that area. It looked to me like the area is being re-vitalized. A number of people were there enjoying the park.",
          "What a beautiful, unique entrance into the city of Des Moines. Gorgeous winter, spring, summer or fall and provides a magnificent backdrop for food and music events throughout the year.",
          "I always drive by there and never stop. Today, I stopped and slowly walk by things that have been built. It's beautiful art work. I understand puts art work at his home. That's neat. I think everyone in Des Moines or comes to our city, should go visit the art work there.",
          "Interesting sculptures scattered around this urban art park. A little chilly in winter-best visited in the summer when the grass is green. The Des Moines Art Festival is held in this area later in the summer-a wonderful outing!",
          "I have been all over North America and have not really seen a park as unique as this one. Set along to blocks it has hosted art festivals in the summer time. All the art is very large and some you can actually stand inside. It worth a trip to this location if your in the Des",
          "What a gift the Pappajohns gave to the Des Moines community! A world class sculpture garden in the heart of downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Walk, tour or wander - all are acceptable. There is a free audio tour available. The garden is a round the clock photo opportunity for amateur",
          "This sculpture park is one of my favorite places to take visitors to Des Moines. I love that our Art Center members and donors like the Pappajohns make art accessible to everyone, not just the economic elite, in our capital city.",
          "We went in Oct. on a beautiful fall day. Does Moines has put so much time, effort and money into their downtown. It is an attraction for everyone. The sculpture garden was serene, colorful and very unique. The photo ops are amazing. No touching the sculptures but...",
          "Had my daughters prom pictures here. The kaleidoscope is an amazing backdrop for any pictures. The alphabet is also a unique picture backdrop.",
          "This is a great introduction to sculpture for all ages, set in a 4.4-acre green space, with the Des Moines skyline as a backdrop. Food trucks park close by in the summer, so you can sit on a bench, eat a delicious but inexpensive lunch, and watch people and art. Afterward, walk",
          "Well worth your trip if you are even just a casual art fan. World class sculptures are located in a very nice green space. This neighborhood has been undergoing a major transformation and the results are incredible. Private/public partnership is making this an art destination",
          "This is a testament to the ongoing connection between Des Moines French legacy and it's modern metropolis. Weathering the brutal Midwest winters, stands a public art installation of contemporary sculptures of varying media. Worth the walk through year round.",
          "Really enjoyed walking the kids through the park, always good to see the new additions. Des Moines downtown is filled with wonderful art work",
          "This park is well connected to the downtown area and is a good place to visit while here in Des Moines. It is only a small stroll from any of the downtown hotels and well worth the effort. When I was here they had food trucks surrounding the park, which was an added advantage.",
          "The Pappajohn Sculpture Park is an unexpected treat with its pieces by well-regarded artists in a nicely landscaped green. It is loosely linked to other plazas and a riverside park in downtown Des Moines in a contemporary City Beautiful effort. Together they bring needed open",
          "Very interesting statues, great place to bring a book, or picnic lunch and just sit and unwind. Easy walking distance from the downtown area and hotels.",
          "This sculpture park is unique to Des Moines, Iowa. It is iconic to everyone who lives in the area and for good reason. Right in the heart of downtown this sculpture park is perfect for an afternoon stroll, a picnic or even a place to step out of the office and breathe. It is",
          "Garden is easy to access on drive by or walking . On street parking is available. Sculptures themselves are not overly interesting, and none are titled so very hard to understand artists objectives. However, concept is nice addition to downtown, even if I found the art itself",
          "Found this amazing sculpture garden in the heart of Des Moines. Excellent examples of modern sculpture. Very worth a trip downtown. A great way to spend a sunny day in Des Moines.",
          "I had read mixed reviews of this park before arriving in Des Moines -- so I wasn't sure it was worth seeing -- but I asked a local who raved about it and I'm really glad we took the time. What an interesting mix of fascinating pieces and a beautiful setting (plus it's all free",
          "Really good park with beautiful sculptures. There are cell phone tours available and also booklets at the corner of the place. Made really good pictures over there!",
          "If you're in the city and have some extra time, I would use it to walk the grounds. The time of year and condition of the property probably had something to do with our experience.",
          "After a fantastic wedding anniversary celebration at the Americana Restaurant and Lounge it was the best place to walk - quiet, serene, peaceful and an experience every visitor to the wonderful city of Des Moines should have.",
          "Located in downtown Des Moines Iowa. I went on a Tues and there was plenty of parking nearby (metered took quarters, .50 gave me about and hour) Many sculptures with name titles and artist. There are brochures in a box that tell about each piece or there is a number to call for",
          "I come from Minneapolis. We have an amazing sculpture park. I state this to let you know what I always compare these kinds of parks to. I was not impressed with the acutal sculptures. However, all art to me is interesting to explore and it was a nice day - so a nice walk around",
          "it is a park downtown , near alot of things to do and beautiful sculptures . Walk around take picture , phone tour for each piece of art.",
          "I hope that tax revenue was not spent to commission this \"art\". It is better than a big open field I suppose. I am sure some would say that I am just not \"open minded\" enough to understand random scrap metal in various shapes.",
          "What a wonderful, beautiful experience. The many attractions are unique, and the landscaping is wonderful. It's a nice place to walk and let your imagination run wild.",
          "Well laid out, large art pieces. Very clean, within walking distance of downtown hotels. Large grassy areas perfect for families with small children to play.",
          "A great walk with anyone to see these artists imagination, we typically see this at the arts festival.",
          "Nice amenity in middle of downtown but it did challenge my appreciation of art. Maybe it's the more abstract I got get. My problem, maybe not yours. Glad we walked through and considered them all.",
          "This is about 2 square grass-covered blocks containing about 20 large and very creative sculptures. It's worth the trip---doesn't take very long to see them all---a half-hour or so. But you'll need to get the interpretive brochure somewhere else such as the Des Moines Art",
          "Des Moines does so many things right, and this is a prime example. Lovely grounds and some fine sculpture. Get a brochure to fully appreciate the art.",
          "I live opposite the sculpture park (and have done for the past year). The park is a great place for a wander in the summer months, either during the week early morning (6 am) or in the evening. I'm a keen amateur photographer and love taking pictures at sunrise and sunset with",
          "Loved t! I would go at night to see the sculptures when they are lit. Jaume Plensa's piece is certainly the highlight!",
          "This is a beautiful Sculpture Park that probably gets overlooked. I have been there several times taking out of state company. It is especially beautiful at night.",
          "Yes its great that this is free to the public but frankly there is not one sculpture I like (or that anyone else I know likes for that matter) and I can only think the \"artists\" had to give the pieces away they are so awful. Otherwise, there is grass to walk or sit on which is",
          "This park is one block long and one narrow block wide. Beautiful park with metal and composite sculptures throughout the park. This is a terrific place to take the kids or to just walk around the park and looking at the sculptures. A few are pretty wild but most are",

          "The Papa John family has spent a lot of money around central Iowa and this is a Des Moines Gem. Trying to pick a day when someone isn't taking senior, family, wedding or engagement pictures is nearly impossible. The artwork/statues are beutiful and some are just very odd. It is",
          "This is a smaller sculpture park but is very nice. If you park over by the library, you can walk through all the sculpture work. Lots of fun photo opportunities available. Love the quality of the art within the park. For a smaller area this is worth a visit.",

          "This is a great park in downtown Des Moines, with inexpensive metered parking surrounding it. The sculptures are varied, and a free brochure located in stands around the park gives you the background on the park and the sculptures. It is well worth a visit, and I want to go back",
          "The art park is one of my favorite places in Des Moines to go relax, walk around and enjoy all the interesting art pieces. The location as well as the park were designed perfectly to give you the feeling that you need to return.",
          "This green space is filled with post-modern, mostly non-figurative sculpture. While most of the art is not compelling, there is something serene about this space. Moreover, it's flanked by many of the best restaurants in downtown, and parking is not too hard to get. Consider a",
          "We went to Pappajohn sculture park but it was very dissapointing,with only a couple of decent sculptures to view the rest was rubbish. The steel horses and the alphabet body are the main attraction the rest are a waste of time,it was free and ok to walk around but go out of your",

          "The artwork is funky and fun. A lovely thing to do before or after a lunch or dinner downtown. It is wheelchair accessible, sidewalks all around. Street parking us usually ample but you will have to feed the parking meters. If touring on foot in Des Moines, park on one of",

          "The garden itself is well laid out and there is information at the entrance. I had a lot of difficulty getting the audio tour to work properly and we couldn't visit one sculpture because of standing water. It could be maintained better and the audio tour could be better. Overall",
          "In the heart of Des Moines there is a hub of activity and so much to see and do on a Saturday morning spring to fall. First there is the Pappajohn Sculpture Park where you can stroll among large art objects and enjoy the beauty of the day. This \"Park\" is right beside the",

          "We had hoped to park the car and wander but did the slow crawl by as a concert had closed the park and there were no parks handy. What we saw was great and well worth the trip into Des Moines, maybe next time we will get to see them close up.",
          "This large, magnificently carpeted-with-lawn, park provides a wonderful - and surprising - setting for a well-selected collection of large-scale art works, ranging from pure abstract to whimsical to outre to humorous. Our visit was on a warm, sunny day. A 45-minute stroll let",

          "Wow, the many different pieces at this sculpture park! I went in December the last time, which made it harder to get around, thanks to the weather. I have been to this sculpture garden many times before and have always enjoyed it. Good place to take a picnic for the kids or",
          "This isn't really an attraction so much as an area you might go for a walk or to relax if you are walking about downtown Des Moines. It's an alright place, but don't expect anything breath-taking. Getting There: Parking is fairly easy to come by in this area, even just on",

          "The park is easily found, clean and inviting. Great place for family activity or just a walk. The sculptures are interesting and mostly, big! Weather pending, good place for picnic. It can be visited in under 30mins if you're in a rush or enjoyed for couple hours. Parking is on",
          "The sculpture park is a great place to wander, people watch, and enjoy some interesting sculptures. No, of course you cannot climb on them as they are expensive pieces of art. But there is an audio guide you can download on podcast or you can use the printed guide. Here is a",

        "wiki": "Des Moines ( (listen)) is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small part of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to \"Des Moines\" in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, Rivi\u00e8re des Moines, meaning \"River of the Monks\". The city's population was 214,237 as of the 2019 population estimate. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 83rd in terms of population in the United States with 699,292 residents according to the 2019 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.Des Moines is a major center of the US insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. The city was credited as the \"number one spot for U.S. insurance companies\" in a Business Wire article and named the third-largest \"insurance capital\" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, TMC Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto, and DuPont Pioneer have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area. Forbes ranked Des Moines as the \"Best Place for Business\" in both 2010 and 2013. In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the \"Wealthiest City in America\" according to its criteria.Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state's capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times said, \"If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nDes Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843\u201346), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. \"Des Moines\" (pronounced [de.mwan] (listen), formerly French pronunciation: \u200b[de.mw\u025bn]) translates literally to either \"from the monks\" or \"of the monks\".\nThe historian Virgil Vogel claimed that the name was derived from Moingona, an Algonquian clan name, which means \"Loon\".Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant \"people by the portage\" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids. This was where the earliest known encounters between the Moingona and European explorers took place.One popular interpretation of \"Des Moines\" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some 200 miles (320 km) from the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines ===\n\nBased on archeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the \"Palace\" is an expansive, 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.At least three Late Prehistoric villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in this area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of Fort Des Moines ===\nDes Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:\n\n\"It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous\".After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort's blacksmith.\n\n\n=== Early, non-Native American, settlement ===\n\nSettlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850\u20131851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:\n\nThis is one of the strangest looking \"cities\" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of \"brick\" and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.\nIn May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. \"The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.\" The city started to rebuild from scratch.\n\n\n=== Era of growth ===\nOn September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name \"Fort Des Moines\" was shortened to \"Des Moines\", and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a 150-foot (46 m) mine shaft to reach a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines' coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city's population in 1910.\nBy 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa's largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines' population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.\n\n\n=== \"City Beautiful\" project, decline and rebirth ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Des Moines undertook a \"City Beautiful\" project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900\u20131910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.\nThe ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s, when the city began a postindustrial decline which lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.\n\nIn 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 600,000 today.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood-stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines river is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.\nToday, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented \"The Tomorrow Plan\", a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa's tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa's tallest building, Principal Financial Group's 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.\nDuring this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and connects many downtown buildings.In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.\nThe World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.\nIn 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the Principal Riverwalk, which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a \"civic garden\" in front of the City Hall. Multiple existing downtown buildings are being converted from office to loft apartments and condominiums. This trend is highlighted by the success of the East Village district of shops, studios, and housing between the Capitol district and the Des Moines River.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 90.65 square miles (234.78 km2), of which 88.93 square miles (230.33 km2) is land and 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) is covered by water. It is 850 feet above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\nIn November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as 5,174 acres (9.27 square miles) and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional 759 acres (1.18 square miles) were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of five central Iowa counties: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison and Guthrie. The area had a 2000 census population of 481,394 and an estimated 2014 population of 768,927. The Des Moines-Newton-Pella Combined Statistical Area consists of those five counties plus Jasper and Marion Counties; the 2000 census population of this area was 550,659, and the estimated 2009 population was 631,805. Des Moines' suburban communities include Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Carlisle, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, Norwalk, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale, Waukee, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfa), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) range, occasionally reaching 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C).

          "Every year Adventureland changes things making them worse and worse honestly. I love going every year but there's always new snags that really irk me. I get that they are for good reason, but there's never a back up, like most rides you can't leave your bags off anymore you have",
          "Absolutely worse than Disney! Millions of people and super long lines, you couldn\u2019t even use the water park because it was a 2 hour line to use the changing rooms! The food lines were about 25 minutes long each. Also hide your smokes cause the 16 year old try and take them out",
          "My daughter and I finally got to Adventureland after several years of living in Iowa. There was certainly nothing wrong with the place - it was clean, parking was organized and easy to follow, and staff was reasonably friendly. There were plenty of rides for all ages, games,",
          "This is an old fashioned amusement park with many of the traditional rides I went on as a child. We took our 11 year old who has a wheelchair. Everyone was very accommodating. It took us a bit to figure out how to get her on a couple of the rides, but the staff there were so",

          "Just avoid this place, especially on weekends. We sat on the frontage road for 35 minutes waiting behind miles of cars trying to get into the park. Once inside you get to wait in more lines to pay for parking with unmarked lanes and cars merging aggressive fighting for a closer",

          "I visited the park with my husband, my son who is a young adult, and a friend visiting from England. I knew going in that Adventureland wasn't in the same class with the big parks in Florida or California, but had forgotten how small and rather run down this one could be.",
          "First time at Adventureland and I guarantee we will go back even thought the trip was 4 hours away. Parking was $10 to enter the park. VERY clean park with tons of rides and things to do. We enjoyed the magic show and a juggling act. There was a circus onsite, but we missed it.",
          "There were a lot of different types of rides, good for all ages. It wasn't too expensive. I love that it is attached to a water park, so we were able to split up the day. My teenage son preferred the water park. It was a hot day, so admittedly I did as well.",
          "The rides were very fun. But the employees were very rude. On the tornado one of the employees yelled at a women that her kid was apparently to short, but they have season passes and have rode it numerous times. On the sky lift on each side were very disrespectful. On one of the",
          "I took my 2 year old for a couple hours on an overcast Sunday. We were able to walk on most kids rides with zero wait. Even the adult ride lines were reasonable. The park isn't super loud or over stimulating. You actually still feel like you're in a park rather than a concrete",
          "We had a great day at Adventureland. We traveled with our daughter, her husband and their three year old grandson. The grounds were clean and staff was friendly. There was a young man singing and playing guitar in the Iowa Beer and Wine tent and we would have liked to stay",
          "This park is one of my favorite traditional parks in the country. So when a friend and I are planning a trip through this part of the country, Adventureland is always included. Things are normally very good here, but this visit was less than stellar, and I am hoping it was",
          "This was our first time visiting so it was a little hard to figure the ins and outs of the park. Nevertheless, we had a blast. The price was about $45 per person but it includes the water park as well. I suggest you not taking much inside because the lockers are located inside",
          "We went as a whole family this Friday. Of course, it was raining Friday morning. We had some sad kids. Anyways, we were pleased to find out that the park does not shut down in the rain. They only shut down for lightening and tornadoes. We went as planned and bought some rain",
          "We normally gonto Worlds of Fun in KC, but decided to give Adventureland a try this year. We went on a Sunday in mid-June, the weather was beautiful and the park was not insanely busy. The park is a manageable size and has a really cute front entrance with little frontier town",
          "I Think it was a cool Amusement park but I had a few concerns I thought they ran the Sky lift a little too fast I had to run fast to get off the ride! I also thought the employees were very rude! I didn't like the Ride operator on the falling Star ride he yelled at me! I didn't",
          "We discovered this place online, and after reading all the favorable reviews, we decided to take the grandkids. We camped with our 32\u2019 motor home towing in their campground. We didn\u2019t even need to drive to the amusement park, as they offered a free trolley service. The days we",

          "Adventureland is a decent park in the heart of Iowa. First with the positives. I give high praise to the staff as each one made our visit great! No words can properly describe these great people. Second , the new Monster roller coaster was an absolute blast! Third, the whole",
          "This was a great place for us for a family vacation! My kids were almost 6 and 3 at the time it they both had tons of fun! The weather could have been a little warmer when we went & then the waterpark side would have been more fun but can't help mother nature! Was a great trip",
          "We go here with friends once a year and we enjoy the water park more than the rest of the park since so many of the roller coasters are getting run down and are so rough that they are uncomfortable to ride. I think that I am not alone because the lines for these rides were so",
          "Adventureland is a rather small park, but that makes it easily navigable and they have plenty to do for all ages. Friendly service, good food, and signs that tell you what rides are out of service that day at the front. I love Adventureland\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1",
          "Iowa is fortunate to have a park like Adventureland here in the center of the state! They are a great little park to take the kids or grand kids to. I used to go here every summer as a kid and cherish those memories. Now that our kids are out of the house, I look forward to",
          "It's tradition that we go to Adventureland every year. It's a nice sized amusement park that offers rides for all ages and thrill seekers. It's clean, wheelchair accessible, and fun for all!",
          "Really fun little park. It ain't Disney World but it doesn't try to be. Lots of charm and for sure worth a visit if it isn't too far out of the way.",
          "Attended a Gun Show at Adventureland. My first visit, luckily my partner had visited before for such events. The parking area has lots of parking, including signed handicap spots. The show was held in the building that has a Movie Theater facade, including a figure in a",

The log ride is closed. The circus is nice. It gives you a little break from walking and lets the kids settle down. The",
          "We took the family for a one day trip and everyone had a great time! The kids (ages 6, 5, and 2) and adults found plenty of things to ride on. We would suggest going to the water park in the morning while the crowd is thin there and then going on rides in the afternoon while",
          "Our group of 12 ranged from 3 years old to 72 years old. The kids were preschool, elementary school, high school, and college age. Everyone had tons of fun. The Barnyard area for little kids was neat. They had added The Monster since the last time I was there. Scary roller",
          "We took a fun family weekend getaway to Adventureland. We ranged in age from 3 to 73 and we all had an excellent time. It was after Labor Day so the waterpark was closed, but we found plenty of other entertainment. My husband is a thrill seeker and absolutely loved the",
          "Our family traveled with grandma, moms and 4 little girls from 1 1/2 to 6 and still found Adventureland to be as much fun as we did when we took their parents! I had read mixed reviews about older facilities and upkeep but everything we encountered was clean, operational and",
          "This park is fantastic for younger kids. There are huge number of rides appropriate for kids from the age of 2-6. We visited the first weekend of the of the State Fair and the lines were very short. The downside is the rollercoasters. While the new Monster is fantastic the",
          "we decided to go to Omaha and KC from now on. They have smoking areas, but I guess we are heathens now and can't go have a smoke all day. So no, we don't want to worry those people up at Adventureland.",
          "Nice mix of rides for the younger children, for the tweens, and the teens. Food selection was good, although quality could be improved. The magician was entertaining, and stayed for the nighttime hypnotist show which our whole group enjoyed very much. My children loved the",
          "Overall, Adventureland is great. There are lots of rides that are fun and even the small kids can ride. There are a few roller coasters, and at least one of them will slam your head around and leave you regretting that ride, but the others are better. We always go on a",
          "We visited Adventureland last week. I hadn't been in nearly 20 years. Our four and eight year old kids had lots of fun. The park shows its age in places, and some of the rides aren't super spectacular (though the new-ish roller coaster The Monster, is really good), but overall",
          "Good place to hangout with friends and family! Love the lights and fun. Food options needs to be improved",
          "There used to be a time that I would go to the fair for the food & than go to Adventureland for the rides. It used to be affordable. Now, a family of four pays $180.00 to get into Adventureland. You've got to be kidding me. Sure, you can get a coupon at Hy-Vee that offers a",
          "Adventure Land is not Disney World, but they do a very nice job for the price. Kids were $40 for the day and adults $50 I believe. We went tot he water park portion first and then took in several of the rides in the park. There are roller coaster and more. Plus things for",
          "We took our kids and grandkids to Adventure Land for the day. There was so many wonderful things to do, from magic acts to Roller coaster rides. Water adventures and games. We took a picnic lunch with us and ate it outside the park and then went back in and played some more.",
          "Adventureland is a great amusement and water park. You get admission to both with one ticket. Parking is $10 and the line to park can get crazy on the weekends so be sure to get there before opening. Most of the Roller Coasters have a 42\" height limit so my 5-year-old",
          "What a fun weekend! This amusement park is one of the cleanest parks we've experienced. The employees are very nice and kid-friendly. We will come again!!!",
          "We had a group of 16 plus a child of 18 months. We had a wonderful time that morning; however, the longer the day got the more crowded it became. The lines were moving slow. We had to wait in line for at least an hour for a couple of the rides. I know that sounds kind of petty",
          "Rented a cabana. Very clean when we arrived. We went on a Monday and there wasn't a big droid. Everyone was very friendly. Tried to take a bag of chips to the cabana but they took them upon entering. Ordered chicken strips and they were very good. Life guards seemed to really be",
          "We spent a summer Tuesday at Adventureland. It was great! Our 9yo and 7yo had a wonderful time, each choosing attractions - sometimes the same and sometimes different. It was a gorgeous day but not crazy busy. We enjoyed the park all morning, and then headed to Adventure Bay in",
          "Our family took our first trip to Adventureland this summer. I was worried there wouldn't be enough rides my kids could go on to keep them busy all day, but I was wrong and in fact I think we could have spent two days there. The park is clean and the food was good. Tickets are a",
          "My wife and I took our three children (ages 9,5, and 5) late July 2018. This park is great for younger kids because the rides are more tailored for them, while the more adventurous rides are well themed. Two issues I do have with the park: 1. The Raging Rapids ride easily has",
          "This is the first year we rented a cabana for our day at Adventureland and we\u2019ll never go again without renting one! With kids 3-11 and a grandma who can\u2019t be on her feet all day, having a private place to hang out and relax occasionally was awesome. A place to lock up valuables",
          "I took my daughter to the park, we did 2 day passes so we could do the water park one day and the rides the next. We got there early the first day, it was nice that they play the National Anthem before the park opens. The waterpark has something for everyone, slides, play area",
          "This is a great park that isn't too expensive. We got our money's worth for sure. We spent 4 hours in the water park enjoying the various rides. Compared to other big parks, you really get a lot for your money. Also, the campground there is a convenient place to stay. It is",
          "This amusement park is perfect for all ages. My 3 and 5 year olds were able to ride multiple rides and our 8 and 13 year old rode almost everything except the ones that one of them was too short for, which was only one or two rides. The Adventure Bay was a great break from",
          "Though most of the rides now are old and rickety, the monster and adventure bay have kept this park alive. The monster is new so it\u2019s still a smooth rollercoaster.

          "Spent 2 days in the park. I have a 7 and 10 year old. Park is perfect for both of them. They could ride every ride and had a blast! The teenagers running the games and food concessions seemed a little slow and sometimes confused but they are just summer help and we kind of",
          "Spent the day here from open to close. Was an absolute blast for our kids as well as us parents. The staff we encountered were very nice, friendly, and accomodating. Lines were normal as to be expected except for the Raging River, that line was brutal. Loved the experience",
          "I live 2 hours away from Adventureland so it is closer then six flags,valleyfair,or worlds of fun. The park is nice, clean and fun. If you go on the rollercoaster the monster (newer green rollercoaster) you will absolutely feel like you will fall out but don't worry it's",

          "It has some nice attractions but definitely not worth any long lines. I do like their mini donuts. Like I always say, families go in with smiles and leave exhausted and grumpy. Trust me. Four hours is about enough at that place. Overpriced.",
          "This was my first time to Adventureland. I love the way the park is set up with the little town when you walk in. I found the two day passes to be more cost effective and was told that if we couldn't make it the next day we could get a refund. The rides were good. Of course,",

          "I would recommend, especially to families with young kids. Clean, lots to do. I was especially impressed with the water park. Tons of food options throughout the park. Downsides: no separate entrance for water park so you have to schlep your stuff ALL the way through the park",
          "Even after a rainy day the family had a blast. Easy to get around and friendly service. Great performers at the circus and rollercoasters were non-stop excitement. The MONSTER was favorite of the family. Very smooth thrill ride. Overall a great time. I highly recommend.",

          "We hadn\u2019t been yet in our 4 years here because I\u2019d heard it wasn\u2019t very good. I was pleasantly surprised overall. There\u2019s a bit of character mixed in with the rides, so it\u2019s more than just a state fair. The water park is very nice too. Makes for a fun day to split time",
          "I had not been to Adventureland for quite some time and I read the reviews and was a little worried at first. I was worried for nothing! The park was very clean. The staff was also walking around with little brooms cleaning up if there was a mess. The park was exactly as I",
          "Ok. . .first let me say I'm not sure what others are complaining about. This is a small amusement park in Iowa. Yes it's near Des Moines. ..but not near anything else. So maybe my expectations were really low. This park was clean, and had an interesting layout. It also had",
          "First of all I will say we had a good time at Adventure Bay, it was clean, and staffed with plenty of life guards. They had vegetarian food options which was awesome. But, we had never been to Adventureland before and discovered you have to walk to the other side of the park to",

          "I started going to Adventureland 40 years ago as a teen. I was looking forward to taking my young grandchild but expected it to be outdated as these types of attractions often become. I was pleasantly surprised! It was clean & well maintained. It was my first experience at",
          "We go during the week and there are no lines. The kids got to ride every ride over and over. The water park was spectacular. We rented a cabana for the day to have a way to get out of the sun and a home base. The kids are old enough to go off in pairs. The park rides are",
          "Even with children ranging from 2 to 12, there is something for everyone. Water rides, roller coasters, the Scrambler and for a few adults even the Monster. Did not do the water park due to one broken arm and the kids still wanted to stay till the park closed. Clean and friendly!",
          "Took our 2 year old grandsons for their birthday! Plenty of rides for little kids and they had a blast.",
          "This is not your typical amusement park like Six Flags or Busch Gardens; this is small town, but a lot of fun for the family. However, during our visit, one of the rollercoasters (Tornado) was not operational. I'm a huge rollercoaster fan and love parks with plenty of them,",
          "I love Adventureland and all of the staff and all of the employees. The only thing I miss is the log ride. They got rid of that, Sad to say.",
          "Spent the entire day here. Kids were running all over to get in line for the next ride. We all had a wonderful day and cant wait to do it again next year. Well worth the money. Clean Park. Staff very helpful, pleasant and acknowledgeable.",
          "Maps given at admission gate, no other signs throughout the park that offer any guidance on how to get somewhere. Water park very crowded, no idea how to get tubes or lockers, as again no signage to help. No idea how to get tubes for the slides or how it works to go on the big",
          "We love this amusement park! It has something for everyone and every age. We also love that all the food is so affordable that it makes feeding a family of 5 in the park quite doable. (We are from the Minneapolis area) also love how the waterpark thins out the crowds.",
          "Reasonable price for a fun day! We are from FL and have been to every park in Orlando and Tampa. They are huge parks with a lot of rides and it comes at a tall price and long wait times. I was traveling with my husband and 17 and 16 year old. We arrived at opening and went",
          "Got there right when it opened so got on the busy rides first with little wait time. Wave pool was fun too.",
          "Always a fun time at Adventureland ! They never disappoint ! Love the Sawmill Splash, one of my favorites ! Nice family trip !",
          "This is our 4th time going....plenty to do and more reasonably priced then other amusement parks. Food and drinks pricy but you can leave park and come back. Lines were very long at a few rides that we couldn't go on them.",
          "This is a great family park. Nicely compact with lots of rides for all ages. Good selection of foods and treats. The water park is very nice, again lots of activities for all ages. Everything is clean and nicely landscaped.",
          "We went to Adventureland for some family fun and try out there in water park. I have to say that was a disappointment. We tried going on the lazy river with are tubes but could not enjoy it because they had people swimming in it. I thought it was for tubing not for swimming.",
          "There is not a lot to do and n Iowa. Thought we would build our vac around this place. It's ok. The waterpark is nice but none of the water is heated. Very very cold. I would say go some place bigger with more things to do. Better for locals and 1 night stay. They are building",
          "I had not heard too much about adventureland prior to this visit. Had heard a lot about worlds of fun Disney world etc. This place blew my expectations out of the water. Everything about it was absolutely fantastic! Our family with a 4 yr old and 7 year old had a blast. We",
          "Would have been higher rating but we arrived at 9 to get in but they don't open till 10am, google says 9. Talked to a manager and he was very unapologetic about the whole thing. Instead of apologizing to the 15 people standing there he apologized to one woman. Food was",
          "Awesome waterpark!!! Great place for a family get away, great food choices, drinks, kids enjoyed it very much, the ticket price gets you I to both parks.",
          "We brought our kids 6 & 8 here for a fun day away. We were pleasantly surprised that the park wasn't overly crowded despite being Memorial Day weekend. We were a little disappointed that several rides were closed, but enough was open to fill our day and then some. There were",
          "We were at this park the first weekend in June and it was fabulous. The only wait time for rides was for The Monster roller coaster, otherwise we just walked up and got on the ride of our choice. Not sure if this is really early in the season for them, but crowds were not an",
          "This is a wonderful place to go to spend a day. Fun rides and the price of the food for 5 people (where we ate anyway) was not bad. The only complaint we have is the roller coaster called The Dragon. Extremely rough (one of the worst roller coasters I've ever been on honestly).",
          "Had a enjoyable fun day. My 6 year old could ride most rides except 3 or 4, he loved all the roller coasters. We did not get to experience the water area it was closed for a few days. I would recommend going during the week to avoid long lines. We also arrived when the park",
          "This place is especially good for my three and six year old Grandkids. We bring them a couple times a year. It is a nice size for us small-towners who don't want the big city hustle and bustle and expense of a Disney or a Six Flags. Our kids are not ready for the big rides,",
          "I've been going to Adventureland every summer now for 16 years and sometimes we go twice a summer. It's worth the 2+ hr drive! We usually pick a weekday to go and it's much less busy. The park is charming, clean, easy to get on rides/short lines, price is good and discounts are",
          "Adventureland is a fantastic amusement park and a good water park all in one. You'll have a good time and no matter your kids ages they'll have a good time too.",
          "If you live anywhere near Altoona Iowa and love rides, get the annual pass for $125 before the end of May. And go to Casey's and get the code for $10 off the pass. Having a pass gets you free parking(saves $10/car), and unlimited visits to Adventureland and the water park. We",
          "My family goes here just about every summer and we always have a good time. It is not too big to fit everything into one day, and while there are a few rides where the line can get long, it isn't like Disney where it seems there is a long wait for most rides. Unlike some bigger",
          "I have been here many times. The parks keeps investing in new rides. The park is clean. I always try to get discount coupons from the local Hy Vee Food Store to help reduce the ticket prices. The food prices at the park are high. There are shady places to sit and rest",
          "Great place to enjoy with the family or even solo. Several rides and games. Test that old arm on the fast pitch! Wide range of foods. Most of the staff are a younger crowd.",
          "I had not been to Adventureland since I was a kid. My husband and I decided to take a little family vacation with our children and Adventureland was our destination. It was a blast! We got in on the last summer of the infamous log ride, and we are so sad it is gone now. The",
          "Every year we come here for our summer vacation & it gets better every summer !!!! Adults, Teenagers both spend the most time in the lazy river because it is Awesome !!!",
          "If you want to try out roller coasters before going to a big park, this is the place in Iowa. It is good for young kids or teens who want to hang out for a while. The water park is good in the summer.",
          "Christmas \ud83c\udf84lights at adventure land benefiting Make a Wish Foundation. $10 per car load. Went on a Tuesday evening and they were busy. Nice lightings and plan on taking awhile to drive through. Busy. Wish they would have had Music as it would have added. Nice way to get in",
          "Got discounted tickets. Was probably the only park in DSM area so we decided to check it out. Good experience so far but won't visit again.",
          "This is a great amusement park. It has kid rides, water rides, a water park, new attractions all the time. Games, bingo, shops, something for everyone! It's a wonderful day of enjoyment we go to every year. Many companies big & small have their annual company picnics at",
          "It was a very fun place. My family and I go there every summer. It made for all ages, everyone can enjoy. The new ride they put in this year the Monster is a very fun roller coaster & as well as the Adventure Bay. Overall it was a very fun trip.",
          "Have been coming here since I was a kid and I love it! They are slowing updating the surroundings BUT the rides are excellent and that beer garden. Super bonus.",
          "As an amusement park enthusiast, I'm always willing to scope out a new one in search of the highest peaks and fastest rails. So when I read that they were opening The Monster, we decided to hop in the car for a road trip! First impression of the park was that it was cute! Not",
          "My family and I go to ADVENTURELAND every year. Usually we go on Father's Day but this year we went in September. The rides are great especially for young children. Lines are usually a lot shorter than other amusement parks. Good is what you would expect. It's amusement",
          "Attended with kids ( 16 8 11 4 ) and wife. We had a blast as usual. We have come each summer for the last 5 years and I came many times when I was a kid. Ride the roller coaters for sure!",
          "I came here as a kid, and wanted my kids to experience it also. A lot of the same rides were still there. Even though the park looks run down, it still offers so much fun! However, we have a teenager, and two younger kids, and they couldn't seem to agree on the rides. I was also",
          "Love a place that has a decent bier garten. Rides are nice. The new Monster roller coaster was a lot of fun. Downer is the cars are so small the line gets lengthy. No more log ride which is a bummer. Lazy river is getting sort of bumpy and lame. Dollars for donuts I would go to",
          "My family went to Adventureland on a Saturday. Hotels in the area were very over priced. Better amusement park value and experience at Worlds of Fun in KC. Expensive to get in, expensive to eat and drink, long lines everywhere. They were I'll equipped to handle the masses.",
          "I started going to Adventureland when I was 4 years old...when the park opened back in the 1970s. They have undergone many changes over the years, not all for the best. I think at some point they kind of pulled back on investing money in the business and tried to make it on",
          "We love this Adventureland park we get season passes every year and camp in the campground multiple times throughout the summer. It's fun and pretty economical for what you get.",
          "This was our first trip to Adventureland and we were really pleased. The oldest kid in our group was 12 years and the youngest was 7 years. This park was perfect for this age range. I liked that no smoking is allowed inside the park. There are a lot of benches to sit on and many",
          "I've been to Des Moines to visit my daughter and her family lots of time but this was the first for Adventureland. It is a really nice little park. My grandkids loved the rides and we also enjoyed the water park.",
          "Such fun! Rides for all ages. The water park is so much fun. Waits in line were not too bad. Plan for all day. Ticket prices are a bit high but one member of family was a veteran so they allowed $10 off per person in the party. Staff were respectful and I liked that there was",
          "We do not like the rides but after winning tickets we decided to go. Spent most of our day in the lazy river just floating around. Thankfully the weekday we went was not too busy. It would not have been as enjoyable if it was crowded.",
          "Adventureland is a great park for young children and adults alike. Its quaint, easily navigated, and a lot of fun. Many different rides for all ages. Go on a weekday to have the park nearly to yourself.",
          "My pre-teens and teens always have an amazing time here. Water park is perfect for cooling off midday. Wish that you could bring lunch in instead of walking out to parking lot and would love to see the sidewalks be concrete instead of blacktop as it gets so hot. All in all a",
          "The Park was clean and the employees at the rides are well groomed and very friendly. The only place that needs work are the food courts. Over flowing trash and the employees are rude. We visited the park on July 27th and and visited Subland. I placed our sandwich order s",
          "Adventureland is not a secret to all, but for those in the area who haven't been, you are missing out. Not as big as Six Flags or other parks, but with a small town atmosphere with big town rides and shorter lines.",
          "Had a great time with our daughter, son in law, and three of our grandchildren. The ride operators were very safety concerned.",
          "Maybe 3 and a half stars since only 2 water rides were broke down on the fay we went. Went with a group of ten which had 4 adults and kids ranging from 17 to 9 yrs old. Most rides and lines could accommodate us pretty well. Lines not too bad, lots of variability to choose from.",
          "We always have a great time here. It has great hours, great rides, and great staff. I love the number of older generation men and women working here... Everyone seemed to like their jobs. I love that I can buy a refillable cup for $5.00 not $15, and refill it with ice water for",
          "This was a super fun get a way date for me before I went off to college. I had so much fun in the water park! We stayed there from 1-5! But be aware they don't let denim or buckles in the water. So jean shorts are a no go. It was fun! The green and blue slide was the best! The",
          "This is a great little park for little ones. Lots of kiddies rides and fun for the big Kids too. The water park is the best! We make at least 2 trips here a year. Until this trip it had always been very enjoyable. Not sure if it's the end of the season or a rainy day funk",
          "Such a great day trip for the whole family! Smaller than many amusement parks but definitely not small on fun! We will absolutely be back! You just can't go wrong with this place.",
          "I love that they are always adding new things. But they dont spend enough effort on how to lower the wait times for rides. Park is always expanding, which attracts more people, which makes wait times even longer. While waiting the 1 1/2 hrs for the Raging River, I noticed",
          "Smaller parks, so the lines were also smaller. But, some of the rides were VERY short. Tickets, in my opinion, were about $10 over-priced for park admission. Some of the bathrooms were NASTY! Food was what you would expect from an amusement park. Nice park for kids that don't",
          "Water park was the best. About $42/ticket for over 2 dozen rides each. When you consider that sometimes you can spend three times that at Disney and barely ride a quarter of that.......0",
          "We have gone to adverntureland numerous times and we are NEVER DISAPPOINTED!! We now live in NC and still make trips back to Adventureland. It is a great family place and alla the staff is super courteous and nice",
          "Fun for all ages. There are rides for everyone. I love the new roller coaster, Monster, definitely a great addition, though I miss the log ride. Eat before you go and bring a picnic to save money, you can bring water bottles into the park too. Riding at night has a different",
          "We had a mini family reunion with kids of all ages here. (ages 2-11) Everyone had a great time! For the bigger kids/adults, they have great roller coasters, including the new Monster ride. For little kids, they have plenty of mini rides too. The only REALLY long line was",

          "What a great day - I was last there 30 years ago and it had a hint of what I remember augmented with lots of new rides - The MONSTER is amazing and we went on all four super-fun roller coasters- There was enough variety for our family aged 8-18 to keep us busy for 8 hours- We",
          "If you're looking for huge, this isn't the place for you but it is a nice little park with a variety of rides. In my opinion, the best feature of the park is Adventure Bay Water Park. Great addition!",

          "Love the rides and the new Monster is on my top 5 list of coasters. If the rides aren't enough you can go do the water park for the day or the afternoon. Too expensive to eat there.",
          "Went to ride the new roller coaster. We went on a Tuesday and It had rained a little in the a.m. so the park was pretty empty. Waited about 30 minutes in line is all...... was well worth it! Very fun roller coaster. The rest of the rides are your typical here, several other",
          "We just spent a week in Branson, MO, and went to Silver Dollar City and White water . . . . we enjoyed them, but we LOVED that Adventureland has everything in one park! We spent 2.5 hours in the amusement park, then 4 hours in the water park, then another 2.5 hour in the",
          "For the price, this place is fantastic. I took my boys (8 and 13) on a Monday, and this place was still pretty busy. The rides were fun, the staff was friendly, the lifeguards were diligent, and prices on everything there were decent. The only long line I experienced was for",
          "Adventureland is great place for all ages. Always have a blast. It a place worth of going during the summer .",
          "We spent the day with our family here. The price was reasonable for two parks combined. I like that you could spend a second day for a smaller fee. The rides are relatively close to each other and the size of the park is just right. We thought the best ride was the \"monster\". We",
          "Always a clean and fun day to spend with kids of all ages. The park is always clean, the staff members are pleasant, and food is reasonable in price. There is a great mixture of the age old rides like the roller coaster Tornado and Raging Rivers and the newer rides-Storm Chaser",
          "A bit disappointed with Adventureland. There were several rides closed on the day we went. We stood in line for the Raging River for over an hour on a Monday! They were only loading one boat at a time. Bathrooms were disgusting. The magic show was awful, but at least it is",
          "Great place to enjoy some quality family time. Water park is great for all ages, there are 2 sides of the water park that can be enjoyed by all ages. Swim up bar is a plus on hot days.",
          "The weather was perfect for the theme park, but the lines were absolutely ridiculous! We arrived at the inside park at 10:30 am (gates open at 10 am) & we left the park at 5:30 pm. In that 7 hour time frame we only were able to ride \u201c9\u201d rides. The average wait for most",
          "Although we were saddened by the removal of the age old favorite Log Ride, the new roller coaster The Monster that took its place, is great! Being a hot day of our visit, we spent most of our time in the adjacent waterpark. The kids (age 10 and 12) had a blast, and we adults got",
          "We have visited Adventureland from the Quad Cities several times and it is always a wonderful time! Our boys are 3, 5, and almost 16 and they all love it. We bought our tickets in advance from Ascentra Credit Union so they were $28/person (and the 3 was free).",
          "was at Adventureland at 10 am when they opened. was a great day did have a shower come through so they shut rides down for awhile. Great time without long line except for the Monster.",
          "The new coaster Monster was not working and neither was the Sidewinder. Our kids had a great time anyway but the park seems to be kind of boring (ho-hum) without being accompanied by friends. The Waterpark was fun but changing rooms are so gross. Someone needs to routinely",
          "We had a great time at Adventureland. We spent the morning at the amusement park side of the park and the afternoon at the waterpark. There were plenty of rides for everyone in the family, and the waterpark was a blast. I really appreciated that it was not a concrete jungle",
          "Extremely disappointed with our first visit to this park. Pros... Lines were not terrible Parking was well managed Good mix of little kid and bigger kid rides Cons... No smoking park that allows e-cigs/vaping, and does not enforce the no smoking rule, I personally asked 5",
          "We're here for the third year in a row to review the park. They took out the log ride and put in a new roller coaster. It looks awesome. Ok, so we did get 5 rides in on this Sunday morning, and then the 20% chance of rain turned into 100% in a downpour. Very few rides could",

          "Spent the Friday before July 4th weekend at Adventureland. I really like the place have since I was a kid, worked there in the 90s when I was going to college. We spent the majority of the day in the water park area. We rented a Cabana on the Wavepool. I would have rated",
          "We went here on the 4th of July since we was on vacation. We was pleasantly surprised! They have rides for the thrill seekers along with rides for the ones that aren't all about the loops and drops. It wasn't overly crowded and the wait times wasn't very long. We stayed to watch",

          "This family owned amusement park is actually REALLY NICE, just dated. The park is very clean and the food vendors are pretty good. They also offer a very nice water park (much more up to date than the ride area). I believe they just need to get some fresh paint on the roller",

          "I could not believe the lack of long lines at Adventureland. My family goes to Disney World frequently so this was refreshing to be able to just walk straight on to many rides during the summer! The longest wait we had was for Raging River, but it still was not as bad as what I",

          "We loved Adventureland, the thing we loved were the staff they are all over 50. Everyone was friendly, no waiting in line. The waterpark park was closed, but we didn't mind. They have something for everyone.",
          "Went there over the weekend with some friends. I am from the east coast where the amusement parks are everywhere and tend to be a little bit bigger. That being said, we had a great time, the lines were really short and the staff were sooo nice. It's a little bit pricey but",
          "My wife and I spent a Saturday with our daughters and grandsons. Everybody had a blast. This isn't Disneyworld but it is a nice amusement park with a variety of attractions and thrill rides including several good rollercoasters. There is really something for everybody.",
          "The ride shows and attractions are wonderful. The dragon is a must ride. And all of the other rides are a must. There is a new arcade that has been there for 3 years, Other then that nothing else has changed besides the silly silo and the log ride is gone for the monster.",
          "We visited the park on Mothers Day and waited in almost no lines. We traveled with two teenagers and two preschoolers. Everyone had a great time. The new rides look great but some of the old ones could use some freshening up. The park was well staffed with friendly people",
          "Great place! I've been going here for as long as I can remember. There's usually at least one ride shut down. It is a little outdated and bathrooms are gross. Adventureland Bay is great but lines are huge. By tickets in advance!",
          "A lot of the rides were not functioning,the food was wretched, just not what it used to be. We were looking for a fun day at the water park, about 1/2 the attractions were down that day. And the rides are old and decrepit.",
          "Moving to Des Moines from a larger metro area I was skeptical of parks like this but it is the perfect size to take kids. The only caution I have - skip the ski lift if you have younger kids which had (circa 2007) no safety bars or harnesses. I nearly hyperventilated watching",
          "Great place. The kids are what this place is all about. We went camping in our travel trailer. The campgrounds were spotless owners are amazing. Kids loved the rides and water park . We will go year after year for sure. The swimming pool and gameroom and pavillion were about 100",
          "Not a lot of roller coasters to choose from but all are fun. Lots of kiddie rides too. The water park is awesome, I just wish it had a separate entrance. Lots of cool water slides and a swim up bar. Big lazy river. Chairs are impossible to get as the place is always full.",
          "While Adventureland is no Six Flags or Worlds of Fun, it is still an enjoyable place to go to, especially for teenagers or families with young kids. If you have extra time while visiting the Des Moines area or are looking for a place to take your children (or your inner child)",
          "Des Moines is so lucky to have this attraction! This Amusement Park is very clean and they are very particular who they hire as staff members so most of the staff operating the rides are retired folks. Of course the waterpark and games are staffed by students, but everyone",
          "My boys and I love this park! I've been going here since I was a little kid. They have plenty of rides and add at least 1 new one every year. The waterpark is amazing! The food is decent priced and wait lines go pretty quickly.",
          "Took our grand daughters to enjoy the day and enjoy we did! The waterpark here is awesome and everything is under one reasonable price! You actually need two days to spend here to get it all in!",
          "Adventureland is a decent little amusement park in Altoona, Iowa that has \\ a decent selection of rides. Tornado and Outlaw are two good wooden coasters. Dragon is an okay looping coaster, and the Underground is an interesting themed indoor coaster but very tame. The park will",
          "Both my children have season passes, we drop them off in the morning, they spend anywhere from 2 hours to 8 hours there. It is safe, very clean, and the help is very helpful. Both my sons have become addicted to coasters, and are very excited about the new coaster coming to",
          "The amusement park has something for the entire family. I would plan your day of getting there early and staying the entire day. Pack a lunch or pick from several food vendors throughout the park makes your day complete!",
          "This is a great place to go with friends or with family there's something for all ages from little ones to us older ones too. Adventure Bay was one of the highlights of my summer I could not go to Adventureland without visiting Adventure Bay also. The price is also very",
          "Great rides to attract everyone in your party. Lots of rides for little ones, as well as big rides for those wanting a thrill.",
          "Attended company picnic with co-workers. It was nice because each family could go there own way and do the rides that were age suitable for their kids. Good food, great people watching.",
          "Great older park. Opened in 1973. Still in great shape. Many retireed senior citizens work during summer. They are happy, friendly and fun. They are very nice. They cater to disabled and handicapped asking if you want to ride twice. We go back every year.",
          "WE had a great time. The park doesn't seem to be perfectly upkept but as adults we had a great time on the bigger roller coasters and going to the water park! Overall a fun time and worth the cost of admission. Would go again if we were ever in the area.",
          "If you like rides and water and show or two this is for you. For our area this park is fun and entertaining to kids and adults. As all amusement parks the food and drinks are a bit pricey but worth it if you have young kids. The campgrounds are a nice place to relaxe in the",
          "Nice clean never long waits type of family fun! I went ther as a kid And now enjoy taking family there too.",
          "I really enjoy visiting theme parks across the United States. While I think Adventuerland is great for Iowa families, especially those with small children, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",

          "My wife and I were on business in DesMoines in July 2015. She wanted to go so trying to keep peace in the family I agreed. I was pleasantly surprised by the amenities and low cost of entry as well as food and drink. They've tried to copy Disney with a few attractions which made",
          "Dangerously low bar for safety. No seat belts in rides that spin and drop from high elevations-like the 'falling star.' The park looks disorganized and stuck back in the 80s. Go to six flags-they actually have seat belts and genuine safety standards. Risking your life at this",
          "Bought tickets through Veridian credit union as they sell tickets 10 dollars off the parks price. Had a great time at Adventure Land. The amusement park offers rides for all ages and thrill experiences. We ate at one of the indoor places burgers were good sized and",
          "For an amusement park, Adventureland is nice. All of the classic rides. Something for everyone to ride on. Good fair style eats with lots of fun, colorful rides. Good for a day of fun.",
          "One price you can ride all the rides you can manage in a day's time. There are arcades to play. When hot and tire you need to refresh in their water park. Then go for the rides again. And there is the food also. Then at the end of the day are the beautiful fireworks.",
          "Last year was our first your going to Adventureland. I was BLOWN away by the water park. We went again this year and I think my kids could have spent days at just the water park. There are also a lot of rides for them. Not as many for adults we still enjoyed our time.",
          "A little pricy for what it's worth, the water isn't all that great, and some of the rides are a little old but that doesn't mean they aren't fun. Offering an assortment of rides, food, and entertainment Adventureland is by far a great place to spend a day as a family or with",

          "Never pay full price! Most local credit unions in Des Moines area offer discounted tickets to anyone with cash. You just need to call ahead to one to check inventory. The water park is large but dressing rooms could definitely use an upgrade to hold more people. The rides are",
          "Highlight of our trip! AdventureBay kept us cool in the early afternoon, and the thrill rides kept us happy with the short lines and friendly older gentlemen to help us on and off of the rides. It was comfortably busy. Our only regret is that we did not get the second day",
          "The Adventureland Park is as good as always. Very clean and the wait time for rides is not very long at all. We always enjoy our time there. THIS REVIEW IS REALLY FOR THE WATER PARK.....The water park.......I can't find a separate review for that. It was awful. The water park",
          "We should have arrived when they opened to have more fun time. We did the 2 day ticket which was great rides first day and water park the second. Some attendants were rude and very unfriendly....prices not too bad for food. Stroller rental is a little too high so might want to",

          "Adventureland is a nice place to take a family to have fun. It is an amusement park and has every ride imaginable. They have several nice places to eat and a lot of walking. The water rides in the summer are a nice way to stay cool. I gave it a 4 star because I believe that",

          "We spend lots of time at Adventureland. Especially now that they have Adventure Bay. The rides and attractions are just as good as bigger parks in bigger cities. The price for admission is fair considering all there is to do there. The food and beverage is expensive, however,",

          "While it may not have the newest rides it is a big hit. I gave the grandsons the option of Disney world or there. The 8 year old's choice was there his reason he hates lines. We made a two day trip. 1/2 day for the water-park.",

          "The only thing about Adventureland is that it can get old fast. The Raging River is by far the best actual ride but on busy days the wait just isn't worth it. Go with a season pass so the prices aren't so bad. Pretty annoying you have to pay not only for the admission but just",
          "This park is fantastic. They offer a military discount, so the military adult ticket is $30. The employees are very friendly and helpful, the rides are fun and clean. The water park is loads of fun. This is an incredible value and well worth the drive!",
          "I will start off by saying, my family and young kids (8 & 5) had a great time at Adventureland. With that being said, this place needs updating big-time! All the wood rails/steps, etc are all rotting and in need of updating. The rollercoasters are all so rickety and rough, we",
          "We LOVE this park. So great to have both amusement park and water park all in one with such a fun variety of rides perfect for all age groups and interest levels. I will say however that they really need to do some upkeep and painting. MANY of the rides look nasty and old,",

          "We absolutely love AdventureLand Park! This park is just the right size with a great variety of fun-filled rides. Every couple of years we travel to DisneyWorld, but we never miss a summer to fulfill our amusement park thrills at AdventureLand. The kids can never get enough of",

          "The rides here are okay, but this is from someone used to King's Island and Cedar Point. Adventureland is a bit smaller, but still great for a little get-a-way. The waterpark part is amazing! They have a fantastic wave pool, and the slides were GREAT! Overall it was a fun day.",
          "We visited Adventureland in June. It was a perfect time to go to the park because it was not too hot and the lines were not very long. It was nice being able to go between the waterpark and amusement park. When we got hot riding rides, we could go to the watermark to cool",
          "I have a 7 and 9 year old and they can start the day at 10 AM and close the park down at 10 PM - and still want to do more. The water park is awesome with the wave pool (which can get a little crowded.. especially if there are annoying people in inter-tubes), long fast moving",

          "I have been going to Adventureland since I was in junior high (I am now 50), and I have to say, this is the most disappointed I have been. $10.00 just to park the car! That's more than the state fair. The park is definitely showing its age and a sincere lack of maintenance.",

          "Adventureland has been named one of ten of the best amusement parks. It is a lot of fun. Like all parks, the price is high but, you go in and ride all day and watch shows so, it pays for itself.",

          "For the price, the amusement park isn't a great deal. It's only slightly cheaper than the larger amusement parks in neighboring states, but with much less for rides and attractions. However, the new waterpark addition is more than I expected it would be- lots of rides and lots",

Downtown Des Moines is defined by the City of Des Moines as located between the Des Moines River to the east, the Raccoon River to the south, Center Street to the north, and 18th and 15th Streets to the west.In 2014, Downtown Des Moines was listed as the number one \"up-and-coming downtown\" in America, by Fortune.com.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nAs of the 2010 Census, Downtown Des Moines, including the East Village, had a population of 5,431 with a total of 3,667 housing units, with 3,085 of those being occupied.\n\n\n=== Race ===\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 70.1% of the population was white; 20.8% was Black or African American; 4.7% was Asian; 1.9% was American Indian or Alaska Native; 0.2% was Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and 5.7% reported Other.

This shuttle runs from the steps of the Iowa State Capitol to the Pappajohn Sculpture Park.Additionally, Des Moines is served by a wide variety of taxi cab companies. In 2014, the popular ride share service Uber was introduced, much to the dismay of the Des Moines City Council. Many members of the city council believe that Uber should follow local taxi regulations while others believe the service should operate as an app rather than a taxi service.\n\nOne unique aspect of Des Moines transportation is the expansive network of skywalks connecting the downtown buildings. The skywalk network is over four miles long and reaches as far as Wells Fargo Arena. Most of the skywalk system is air conditioned and features automatic doors.

          "Great little park WITH SHADE! Almost always has other kids to play with. Couple downsides though. There's a broken (fenced off,) slide that hasn't been fixed yet and sometimes there's loiterers. \nUPDATE: I haven't seen any loiterers near \u2026",

        "wiki": "Cloris Leachman (born April 30, 1926) is an American actress and comedian. In a career spanning over seven decades she has won eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award, and an Academy Award for her role in The Last Picture Show (1971). She was a part of Mel Brooks's ensemble cast, appearing in iconic roles such as Frau Bl\u00fccher in Young Frankenstein (1974) and Madame Defarge in History of the World, Part I (1981). Her longest-running role was the nosy and cunning landlady Phyllis Lindstrom in the CBS sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show and its spin-off, Phyllis, in the 1970s.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLeachman was born in Des Moines, Iowa, the eldest of three daughters. She attended Theodore Roosevelt High School. Her parents were Cloris (n\u00e9e Wallace; 1901\u20131967) and Berkeley Claiborne \"Buck\" Leachman (1903\u20131956). Her father worked at the family-owned Leachman Lumber Company.The youngest sister, Mary, was not in show business. Middle sister Claiborne Cary (1932\u20132010) was an actress and singer. Their maternal grandmother was of Bohemian (Czech) descent.As a teenager, Leachman appeared in plays by local youth on weekends at Drake University in Des Moines. After graduating from high school, she enrolled at Northwestern University in the School of Education.  At Northwestern, she became a member of Gamma Phi Beta and was a classmate of future comic actors Paul Lynde and Charlotte Rae. She began appearing on television and in films shortly after competing in Miss America in 1946.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter winning a scholarship in the Miss America pageant placing in the Top 16, Leachman studied acting under Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in New York City. She was cast as a replacement for the role of Nellie Forbush during the original run of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific. A few years later, she appeared in the Broadway-bound production of William Inge's Come Back, Little Sheba, but left the show before it reached Broadway when Katharine Hepburn asked her to co-star in a production of William Shakespeare's As You Like It.\n\nLeachman appeared in many live television broadcasts in the 1950s, including such programs as Suspense and Studio One. She made her feature film debut as an extra in Carnegie Hall (1947), but had her first real role in Robert Aldrich's film noir classic Kiss Me Deadly, released in 1955. Leachman was several months pregnant during the filming, and appears in one scene running down a darkened highway wearing only a trench coat. A year later, she appeared opposite Paul Newman and Lee Marvin in The Rack (1956). She appeared with Newman again in a brief role in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).\nShe continued to work mainly in television, with appearances in Rawhide and in The Twilight Zone episode \"It's a Good Life\" as well as the sequel \"It's Still a Good Life\" in the 2002-2003 UPN series revival. During this period, Leachman appeared opposite John Forsythe on the popular anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents in an episode titled \"Premonition\". She later appeared as Ruth Martin, Timmy Martin's adoptive mother, in the last half of season four (1957) of Lassie. Jon Provost, who played Timmy, said, \"Cloris did not feel particularly challenged by the role. Basically, when she realized that all she'd be doing was baking cookies, she wanted out.\" She was replaced by June Lockhart in 1958.\nThat same year, she appeared in an episode of One Step Beyond titled \"The Dark Room\", in which she portrayed an American photographer living in Paris. In 1960, she played Marilyn Parker, the roommate of Janice Rule's character, Elena Nardos, in the Checkmate episode \"The Mask of Vengeance\". In 1966, she guest starred on Perry Mason as Gloria Shine in \"The Case of the Crafty Kidnapper\". In late 1970, Leachman starred in one episode of That Girl as Don Hollinger's sister, Sandy.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nLeachman won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in The Last Picture Show (1971), based on the bestselling book by Larry McMurtry. She played Ruth Popper, the high school gym teacher's neglected wife, with whom Timothy Bottoms' character has an affair. Director Peter Bogdanovich had predicted during production that she would win an Academy Award for her performance. The part was originally offered to Ellen Burstyn, but Burstyn wanted another role in the film.\n\nLeachman has also won a record-setting eight Primetime and one Daytime Emmy Awards and has been nominated more than 20 times, most notably for playing Phyllis Lindstrom on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Lindstrom was a recurring character on the program for five years and was subsequently featured in a spinoff series, Phyllis (1975\u20131977), for which Leachman won a Golden Globe Award. The series ran for two seasons. Its cancellation was partly due to the deaths of three regular or recurring cast members during its brief run: Barbara Colby (murdered under mysterious circumstances in a Los Angeles park), and Judith Lowry and Burt Mustin (who played a newly married couple on the show; both were in their 80s and died of natural causes).\n\nIn 1977, she guest-starred on The Muppet Show, episode 2.24. In 1978, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theater. In 1987, she hosted the VHS releases of Schoolhouse Rock! and portrayed the evil witch Griselda for Disney's Cannon Tales production of Hansel and Gretel. In 1986, she returned to television, replacing Charlotte Rae's character Edna Garrett as the den mother in The Facts of Life. Leachman's role as Edna's sister, Beverly Ann Stickle, could not save the long-running series, and it was canceled two years later.\nShe has voice-acted in numerous animated films, including My Little Pony: The Movie (as the evil witch mother from the Volcano of Gloom), A Troll in Central Park (as Queen Gnorga), The Iron Giant, Gen\u00b9\u00b3, and most notably as the voice of the cantankerous sky pirate Dola in Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 feature Castle in the Sky. Dubbed by Disney in 1998, Leachman's performance in this film received nearly unanimous praise. Leachman played embittered, greedy, Slavic Canadian \"Grandma Ida\" on the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, for which she won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (in 2002 and 2006). She was nominated for playing the character for six consecutive years. The win marked four consecutive decades with a Primetime Emmy Award for acting, dating back to the 1970s.\nLater television credits include the successful Lifetime Television miniseries Beach Girls with Rob Lowe and Julia Ormond. Leachman was nominated for a SAG Award for her role as the wine-soaked former jazz singer and grandmother Evelyn in the Sony feature Spanglish opposite Adam Sandler and T\u00e9a Leoni. She had replaced an ailing Anne Bancroft in the role. The film reunited her with the Mary Tyler Moore Show writer, producer, and director James L. Brooks. That same year, she appeared with Sandler again in the remake of The Longest Yard. She also appeared in the Kurt Russell comedy Sky High as a school nurse with X-ray vision. In 2005, she guest-starred as Charlie Harper's neighbor Norma in an episode (#3.9, \"Madame and Her Special Friend\") of Two and a Half Men.\nIn 2006, Leachman's performance alongside Sir Ben Kingsley and Annette Bening in the HBO special Mrs. Harris earned her an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie as well as a SAG Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. On May 14, 2006, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Drake University.Leachman was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2011. That same year, she was ranked No. 23 on the TV Guide Network special Funniest Women on TV.On June 20, 2014, Leachman received an honorary degree from her alma mater, Northwestern University.In 2017, she received PETA's Lifetime Achievement Award for her dedication to animal rights issues.\n\n\n=== Mel Brooks ===\n\nLeachman appeared in three Mel Brooks films, including Young Frankenstein (1974) in which the mere mention of the name of her character, Frau Bl\u00fccher, elicits the loud neighing of horses (this was an homage to a cinematic villain stereotype; Leachman claimed that Brooks told her that Bl\u00fccher was German for \"glue\", though it is not), High Anxiety (1977) as the demented villainess and psychiatric nurse Charlotte Diesel, and Madame Defarge in History of the World: Part I.\nIn 1989, Leachman starred on Brooks' short-lived NBC sitcom The Nutt House in dual roles as head hotel housekeeper Mrs. Frick (a variation of the Frau Bl\u00fccher character) and Mrs. Nutt, the senile owner of the hotel (who was only featured in the two-part pilot).\nShe auditioned to revive her role from Young Frankenstein in the 2007 Broadway production opposite Megan Mullally (who replaced Kristin Chenoweth) and Roger Bart. However, Andrea Martin was cast instead. Brooks was quoted as saying that Leachman, at 81, was too old for the role. \"We don't want her to die on stage,\" he told columnist Army Archerd, a statement to which Leachman took umbrage. However, due to Leachman's success on Dancing with the Stars, Brooks reportedly asked her to reprise her role as Frau Bl\u00fccher in the Broadway production of Young Frankenstein after the departure of Beth Leavel, who had succeeded Martin. The Broadway production closed before this could happen.\n\n\n=== Dancing with the Stars ===\nLeachman was a contestant on the seventh season of Dancing with the Stars, paired with Corky Ballas, the oldest of the professionals and father of two-time champion Mark Ballas. Leachman is the oldest person to compete on the show to date. She placed seventh in the competition.\n\n\n=== Later projects ===\nLeachman played the role of Memaw in the film I Can Only Imagine, which is about the story behind the song of the same name by MercyMe.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFrom 1953 to 1979, Leachman was married to Hollywood impresario George Englund. Her former mother-in-law was character actress Mabel Albertson. The marriage produced five children, four sons and one daughter: Bryan (died 1986), Morgan, Adam, Dinah, and George. Some of them are in show business. Her son Morgan played Dylan on Guiding Light for several years. \n\nThe Englunds were Bel Air neighbors of Judy Garland and Sid Luft, and of their children, Lorna and Joey Luft, during the early 1960s. Lorna Luft stated in her memoir Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir that Leachman was \"the kind of mom I'd only seen on TV\". Knowing of the turmoil at the Luft home but never mentioning it, Leachman prepared meals for the children and made them feel welcome when they needed a place to stay.Leachman was also a friend of Marlon Brando, whom she met while studying under Elia Kazan in the 1950s. She introduced him to her husband, who became close to Brando as well, directing him in The Ugly American and writing a memoir about their friendship called Marlon Brando: The Way It's Never Been Done Before (2005).In a parody of Demi Moore's famous Vanity Fair magazine cover photo, Leachman posed nude on the cover of Alternative Medicine Digest in 1997, body-painted with images of fruit. A vegetarian, she also posed clad only in lettuce for a 2009 PETA advertisement. She starred in a comedic 2013 spay and neuter ad for PETA, opening a condom wrapper with her teeth.Leachman is an atheist.Her autobiography Cloris: My Autobiography was published in March 2009. She wrote the bestselling book with Englund, her former husband.\nLeachman's granddaughter, Anabel Englund, is a singer. In addition to Anabel, Leachman has five other grandchildren\u2014Portia, Skye, Arielle, Jackson, and Hallelujah\u2014and one great-grandson, Braden.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCloris Leachman on Twitter \nCloris Leachman on IMDb \nCloris Leachman at the TCM Movie Database \nCloris Leachman at the Internet Broadway Database \nGross, Terry (June 3, 2009). \"Interview\" (streaming audio).

        "wiki": "The Special Counsel investigation was an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, alleged links between associates of Donald Trump and Russian officials and possible obstruction of justice by Trump, conducted by special prosecutor Robert Mueller from May 2017 to March 2019. It was also called the Russia investigation, the Mueller probe, and the Mueller investigation. Prior to the appointment of the Special Counsel, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been, starting in July 2016, covertly investigating activities by Russian operatives and by members of the Trump presidential campaign, under the code name \"Crossfire Hurricane\". The investigation culminated with the Mueller Report which concluded that \u2014 though the Trump campaign welcomed Russian interference and expected to benefit from it \u2014 there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy charges against Trump or his associates. The Report did not reach a conclusion about possible obstruction of justice, citing a Justice Department guideline that prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president.In May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to take over the FBI's work. As Rosenstein later informed Congress, he elected to use a Special Counsel because of the ongoing concerns about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and his own concerns about the capabilities of the acting Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, to carry out the investigation, but the lack of any Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorneys at that point meant that he would need to appoint someone else. Mueller was an appropriate choice in his view. According to its authorizing document, the investigation's scope included allegations of \"links and/or coordination\" between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Mueller was also mandated to pursue \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" The probe included a criminal investigation which looked into potential obstruction of justice charges against President Trump and members of his campaign or his administration. The New York Times reported in August 2020 that Rosenstein curtailed a May 2017 FBI inquiry into Trump\u2019s personal and financial dealings in Russia, giving the bureau the impression that the special counsel would investigate it, though Rosenstein instructed Mueller not to.The investigation was officially concluded on March 22, 2019, with the Mueller Report submitted to Attorney General William Barr. Barr had been critical of the investigation before he became Attorney General. A redacted version of the report was released to the public on April 18, 2019. The report concluded that the Internet Research Agency's social media campaign supported Trump's presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton's, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and various Democratic Party organizations. The investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", and determined that the Trump campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\". The evidence was not necessarily complete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony. Mueller later said that the investigation's conclusion on Russian interference \"deserves the attention of every American\".On potential obstruction of justice by President Trump, the investigation \"does not conclude that the President committed a crime\", as investigators would not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. However, the investigation \"also does not exonerate\" Trump, finding both public and private actions \"by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations\". Ten episodes of potential obstruction by the president were described. The report states that Congress can decide whether Trump obstructed justice, and has the authority to take action against him. Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had authorized the Mueller probe, decided on March 24, 2019, that the evidence was insufficient to establish a finding of obstruction of justice. Upon his resignation on May 29, 2019, Mueller stated that: \"the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing\". In July 2019, Mueller testified to Congress that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after he left office.\n\n\n== Original claims of Russian election involvement ==\nThe first public US government assertion of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election came in a joint statement on September 22, 2016, by Senator Dianne Feinstein and House member Adam Schiff, the top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively. The US Intelligence Community released a similar statement fifteen days later.In January 2017, an assessment was released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, then headed by Obama appointee James Clapper, which asserted that Russian leadership had favored presidential candidate Donald Trump over rival candidate Hillary Clinton, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally ordered an \"influence campaign\" to harm Clinton's electoral chances and \"undermine public faith in the US democratic process\". It is alleged that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election by bolstering the candidacies of Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein in order to increase political instability in the United States as well as to damage the Clinton presidential campaign.\n\n\n== Origin and powers ==\n\n\n=== Original FBI investigations ===\n\nWhen the special counsel was appointed by Rod Rosenstein in May 2017, the special counsel took over an existing counterintelligence investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into what proved to be Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and numerous secretive links between Trump associates and Russian officials. According to reports, Australian officials informed American officials that in May 2016, a Trump presidential campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, told the Australian High Commissioner to Britain, Alexander Downer, that Russian officials were in possession of politically damaging information relating to Hillary Clinton, the rival presidential candidate to Trump from Democratic Party. Since the FBI, in response to this information, opened an investigation into the links between Trump associates and Russian officials on July 31, 2016, the meeting between Papadopoulos and Downer is considered to be the 'spark' that led to the Mueller investigation. In February 2018, the Nunes memo, written by staff for U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, stated that the information on Papadopoulos \"triggered the opening of\" the original FBI investigation, rather than the Trump-Russia dossier of Christopher Steele (see below) as asserted by, among others, Trump, Nunes, Fox News hosts Steve Doocy, Ed Henry, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy.The special counsel also took over an FBI investigation on whether President Trump had committed obstruction of justice, which began within eight days after Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. CNN reported in December 2018 that then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe started the investigation based on Comey's firing\u2014which had been recommended in writing by Rosenstein in what became known as the Comey memo\u2014and also Comey's allegation that Trump had asked him to stop investigating Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn. In February 2019, McCabe, since fired from the FBI, confirmed he launched the obstruction of justice investigation for those reasons, and gave additional reasons such as Trump's multiple depictions of the investigation into Trump associates and Russia as a \"witch hunt\", as well as Trump allegedly telling Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to mention the Russia probe in Rosenstein's memo to recommend firing Comey, and Trump's comments to the Russian ambassador and NBC relating Comey's firing to the Russia probe.\n\n\n=== Appointment and original oversight ===\n\nA special counsel investigation is subject to oversight by the Attorney General. After questions arose regarding contacts between then-senator Jeff Sessions and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in 2016, one of the first things Sessions did after being appointed Attorney General, was to recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations regarding Russian interference in the election.Once Attorney General Sessions recused, oversight of any Russia investigation into the 2016 election fell to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee. As part of his oversight, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel in May 2017 with the mandate \"to oversee the previously-confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters\".Rosenstein has said he would recuse himself from supervision of Mueller if he himself were to become a subject in the investigation due to his role in the dismissal of Comey. If Rosenstein were to recuse himself, his duties in this matter would have been assumed by the Justice Department's third-in-command, Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio. So long as no successor fills that office, Solicitor General Noel Francisco would assume the authorities of Associate Attorney General.\n\n\n=== Reasons for appointing a special counsel ===\n\n\n==== Firing of James Comey ====\n\nThe special counsel appointment on May 17, 2017, came after protests, mostly from Democrats, over President Trump firing the FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. In Congress, in reaction to Comey's firing, over 130 Democratic lawmakers called for a special counsel to be appointed, over 80 Democratic lawmakers called for an independent investigation, while over 40 Republican lawmakers expressed questions or concerns. Complicating the situation, Comey arranged to leak to the press classified information, notes from an interview with the president where Trump asked him to end the probe into Michael Flynn. Comey would later be rebuked by the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General for this action.  Trump fired Comey on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.The New York Times reported on January 11, 2019, that FBI counterintelligence grew concerned about Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off opening an investigation because of uncertainty about how to proceed on such a sensitive matter. Trump's behavior during the days immediately before and after Comey's firing caused them to begin investigating whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests, knowingly or unknowingly. The FBI merged that counterintelligence investigation with a criminal obstruction of justice investigation related to Comey's firing. Mueller took over that investigation upon his appointment, although it was not immediately clear if he had pursued the counterintelligence angle.\n\n\n==== Authority ====\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in his role as Acting Attorney General for matters related to the campaign due to the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appointed Mueller, a former Director of the FBI, to serve as Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with authority to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, including exploring any links or coordination between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government; \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\"; and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a).As Rosenstein later informed Congress, he elected to use a Special Counsel rather than have the FBI itself oversee the investigation because did not believe acting Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe was the right person to lead the investigation. Instead, he would appoint a Special Counsel, as had been done in the past. U.S. Attorneys serve as special counsel, but in May 2017 there were only three Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorneys serving at the time, the Senate having not yet confirmed the new president's nominees, and those three had remained as holdovers from the previous administration pending the arrival of the new attorneys. As a result, Rosenstein decided to select Robert Mueller, though he was retired, because of his reputation.As special counsel, Mueller had the power to issue subpoenas, hire staff members, request funding, and prosecute federal crimes in connection with the election interference along with other crimes he may uncover. The constitutionality of indicting a sitting president remains an unsettled legal question.\n\n\n=== Release of findings ===\n\nThe Special Counsel law requires a special counsel to confidentially provide the current attorney general with a report of findings. The attorney general, in this case William Barr, is then required to provide a summary of the findings to Congress, although he has considerable discretion in how much detail he provides. The full release of the Mueller findings to Congress and the public is not assured. Should Congress be dissatisfied with the summary it is provided, it could subpoena Mueller's full report, and, if necessary, sue in federal court. Congress could also call Mueller to testify.White House attorneys expect to preview whatever findings Barr decides to provide to Congress and the public, in order to consider asserting executive privilege to withhold the release of information gleaned from internal documents and interviews with White House officials. Commentators have noted that executive privilege cannot be invoked if the purpose is to shield wrongdoing or unlawful conduct.On March 14, 2019, the House voted 420\u20130 in favor of a non-binding resolution calling for the full special counsel report to be released to Congress and the public, excluding classified or grand jury information. The same day the bill was brought before the Senate for unanimous consent, but was blocked by Senator Lindsey Graham, who said it needed a clause requiring the appointment of a special counsel to investigate allegations against the 2016 Clinton campaign. On March 15, Trump stated \"there should be no Mueller Report\" because \"this was an illegal & conflicted investigation.\" Five days later he stated, \"I told the House, 'If you want, let [the public] see it,'\" adding, \"that's up to the Attorney General.\" On March 25, 2019, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blocked an effort by minority leader Chuck Schumer for the Senate to take up the same resolution approved by the House eleven days earlier.The special counsel delivered its report to Attorney General Barr on March 22, 2019. Two days later, on March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter of the report to Congress, describing the conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and obstruction of justice.Barr said the report would be delivered to Congress by mid-April, with some redactions of any information that would \"potentially compromise sources and methods\" or \"unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties\". A two-volume redacted version of the full report was publicly released on April 18, 2019. A less-redacted version of the report will eventually provided to a limited number of members of Congress.\n\n\n== Grand juries ==\nOn August 3, 2017, Mueller empaneled a grand jury in Washington, D.C., as part of his investigation. The grand jury has the power to subpoena documents, require witnesses to testify under oath, and issue indictments for targets of criminal charges if probable cause is found.\nThe Washingtonian grand jury is separate from an earlier Virginian grand jury investigating Michael Flynn; the Flynn case has been absorbed into Mueller's overall investigation.The grand jury has issued subpoenas to those involved in the Trump Tower meeting held on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower, which was also the location of Trump's presidential campaign headquarters.\nRinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born lobbyist and former Soviet Army officer, a participant in the Donald Trump Jr. meeting, testified under oath for several hours on August 11, 2017.\nJason Maloni, spokesman for Paul Manafort, testified under oath for more than two hours on September 15, 2017. Maloni was employed by Manafort following the five months he served as Chairman of Trump's campaign for president in 2016, to answer questions about Manafort's involvement in Trump's campaign.\nSam Clovis testified during the week of August 23, 2017.\nCarter Page\nGeorge Nader, Lebanese-American businessman who advises UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, testified during the week preceding March 5, 2018.NBC News reported on August 25, 2017, that \"in recent days\" the grand jury subpoenaed witness testimony from the executives of six public relations firms, who worked with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on lobbying efforts in Ukraine.On January 16, 2018, The New York Times reported that Steve Bannon was subpoenaed by Mueller to testify before the standing grand jury in Washington, DC. Reuters and CNN reported the next day that Bannon had struck a deal with Mueller's team to be interviewed by prosecutors instead of testifying before the grand jury. On February 15, 2018, multiple sources reported that those interviews had taken place over several days that week. TMZ reported that Kristin M. Davis, the \"Manhattan Madam\" who had previously worked for Roger Stone, was subpoenaed in June 2018. On August 10, 2018, a federal judge found Stone's former aide Andrew Miller to be in contempt of court for refusing to testify before the grand jury. Also that day, the Mueller investigation subpoenaed Randy Credico, whom Stone had described as his \"backchannel\" to Julian Assange. The Wall Street Journal reported on November 14, 2018, that Mueller's investigators are examining whether Stone engaged in witness tampering by intimidating Credico into supporting Stone's assertions.Jerome Corsi, former Washington bureau chief of Infowars, was subpoenaed to appear on September 7, 2018, before a Mueller grand jury. Corsi's attorney said he expected his client to be asked about his association with Roger Stone, who had appeared to know in advance that WikiLeaks would release damaging information about the Clinton campaign.\n\n\n== Legal teams ==\n\nThe investigation involves multiple legal teams, specifically the attorneys, supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, taking part in the investigation; the team defending President Trump in his personal capacity; and the team representing the White House as an institution separate from the President.\nAccording to CNN, as of August 2018, the prosecution team includes 15 attorneys, led by Mueller. The additional supporting staff brings the number over 30. There have been few reported departures from Mueller's team.The defense has two components: Emmet Flood representing the White House, and a team representing Trump personally, including Jay Sekulow, Andrew Ekonomou, Rudy Giuliani, the Raskin & Raskin law firm, and Joanna Hendon. Former members of the defense team include white-collar crimes expert John Dowd and Ty Cobb representing the office of the presidency.Mueller's legal team has been consistently attacked as biased against President Trump, who once referred to this team as \"The 13 Angry Democrats\". According to Politifact, while 13 of the 17 team members are indeed Democrats (the rest unaffiliated to either of the two major parties), however, Mueller himself is a registered Republican, and choosing to hire or not hire career attorneys on the basis of political affiliation is contrary to both Justice Department policy and federal law.\n\n\n== Changes to oversight leadership ==\n\n\n=== Whitaker's succession ===\nAs the Mueller investigation progressed, Trump repeatedly expressed anger over Attorney General Sessions' decision to recuse. In July 2017, Trump said that Sessions should have informed him about Sessions' impending recusal before Trump even nominated him, then Trump would have nominated someone else for Attorney General. In May 2018, Trump said that he wished that he had nominated someone other than Sessions for Attorney General. In August 2018, Trump declared that Sessions' job was safe at least until the November 2018 United States midterm elections. Sessions resigned as Attorney General on November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, writing that he had resigned at Trump's request.\n\nWith Sessions' resignation, Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, as Acting Attorney General on November 7, 2018. This meant that Whitaker assumed oversight of the Mueller investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.Previously in August 2017, one month prior to joining the Justice Department as Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker wrote an opinion column for CNN titled \"Mueller's investigation of Trump is going too far\". He stated that Mueller's investigation is a \"lynch mob\", that it should be limited and should not probe into Trump's finances. Whitaker also argued in 2017 that the Trump Tower meeting was neither improper nor evidence of collusion. The New York Times reported that White House aides and other people close to Trump anticipated that Whitaker would \"rein in\" the investigation.Whitaker, a vocal Trump supporter, had publicly criticized the Mueller investigation on several occasions before joining the Justice Department in September 2017, asserting it was \"going too far\" and referring to it as a \"lynch mob\". Whitaker is also a personal friend of Sam Clovis, a former co-chair of the Trump campaign who has testified to Mueller's investigators and grand jury. Because of his prior statements and involvement, many Democrats and some Republicans have asserted that Whitaker's potential conflicts of interest require him to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller, although Whitaker reportedly indicated he had no intention of doing so. Justice Department ethics officials typically review conflicts of interest to recommend recusals, but their findings are not binding and are usually kept confidential.\n\n\n=== Barr's succession ===\nOn December 7, 2018, President Trump declared that he would nominate William Barr for the vacant post of Attorney General. Barr was previously Attorney General under President George H. W. Bush.During his January 2019 confirmation hearings, Barr suggested the investigation's findings could be withheld from the public, as their release is not mandated by law. In June 2018, Barr had sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and Trump attorneys arguing that the Special Counsel's approach to potential obstruction of justice by Trump was \"fatally misconceived\" and that, based on his knowledge, Trump's actions were within his presidential authority. In June 2017, Barr had characterized the obstruction investigation as \"asinine\" and that it was \"taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president\". Trump stated in a February 2019 interview that he had not committed to releasing the Mueller report.On February 14, 2019, Barr was sworn in as Attorney General after the Senate approved his appointment by a 54-45 vote that day, thus gaining oversight of the Mueller investigation from Whitaker.\n\n\n== Topics ==\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, serving as Acting Attorney General due to the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, authorized Mueller to investigate and prosecute \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump\", as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\" and any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4 \u2013 Jurisdiction.\n\n\n=== Russian election interference ===\n\nIn late-July 2016, the FBI opened counterintelligence investigations into four Americans who had contact with Trump to determine whether they might have coordinated or cooperated with Russia's activities. Those investigations became part of the Special Counsel's portfolio.U.S. intelligence agencies in January 2017 concluded \"with high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the election by hacking into the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the personal Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and forwarding their contents to WikiLeaks, as well as by disseminating fake news promoted on social media, and by penetrating, or trying to penetrate, the election systems and databases of multiple U.S. states. de Volkskrant reported on January 25, 2018, that Dutch intelligence agency AIVD had penetrated the Russian hacking group Cozy Bear in 2014 and in 2015 observed them hack the DNC in real time, as well as capturing the images of the hackers via a security camera in their workspace. The New York Times reported on July 18, 2018, that American, British and Dutch intelligence services had observed stolen DNC emails on Russian military intelligence networks. NBC News reported on March 1, 2018, that Mueller was assembling a case for criminal charges against Russians who carried out the hacking and leaking. Those charges were brought on July 13, 2018.Russia's influence on U.S. voters through social media is a primary focus of the Mueller investigation. Mueller used a search warrant to obtain detailed information about Russian ad purchases on Facebook. According to a former federal prosecutor, the warrant means that a judge was convinced that foreigners had illegally contributed to influencing a US election via Facebook Ads.On February 13, 2018, in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the heads of the top six American intelligence agencies unanimously reaffirmed Russian interference. Three sources familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN he remains unconvinced that Russia interfered because it suggests he didn't win the election solely on his own merits.During a July 16, 2018, press conference at the 2018 Russia\u2013United States summit in Helsinki, Finland, President Putin was asked, \"did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?\" Putin replied, \"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\"The Mueller Report concluded while there was no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the election, the Russian government did attempt to influence the election in Trump's favor by hacking Democratic political organizations and spreading \"disinformation and social media\" discord.\n\n\n=== Links between Trump associates and Russian officials ===\n\nAs early as spring 2015, American intelligence agencies started overhearing conversations in which Russian government officials, some within the Kremlin, discussed associates of Trump, then a presidential candidate.\n\nThe New York Times reported on February 14, 2017, that phone records and communications intercepts showed that Trump associates\u2014including members of the Trump campaign\u2014had \"repeated contacts\" with senior Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 campaign. Paul Manafort was the only Trump associate who was specifically identified as participating in these communications. In addition, some senior Trump associates, including Kushner, Trump Jr., Sessions, Flynn and Manafort, had direct contacts with Russian officials during 2016. In congressional testimony the following June, Comey stated the Times report was \"in the main\" not true. The Times reported that during the intervening months, its sources continued to  believe the reporting was \"solid.\"  In July 2020, the Senate Judiciary Committee released notes taken contemporaneously with the Times report by FBI Counterintelligence Division chief Peter Strzok indicating his skepticiam about the Times' reporting, writing, \u201cWe have not seen evidence of any officials associated with the Trump team in contact with [intelligence officers]\" and \"\u201cWe are unaware of ANY Trump advisors engaging in conversations with Russian intelligence officials.\u201d The Times stood by its account, subsequently reporting that the released notes did not provide a fully accurate representation of Strzok's knowledge. Michael Flynn was forced to resign as National Security Advisor on February 13, 2017, after it was revealed that on December 29, 2016, the day that Obama announced sanctions against Russia, Flynn had discussed the sanctions with Russian ambassador Kislyak. Flynn had earlier acknowledged speaking to Kislyak but denied discussing the sanctions. Also in December 2016, Flynn and presidential advisor Jared Kushner met with Kislyak hoping to set up a direct, secure line of communication with Russian officials about which American intelligence agencies would be unaware. Jared Kushner also met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of the Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank (VEB), which has been subject to U.S. economic sanctions since July 2014. Flynn and Kushner failed to report these meetings on their security clearance forms.The Trump Organization pursued a luxury hotel and condominium project in Moscow\u2014dubbed the Trump Tower Moscow\u2014during the Trump presidential campaign. This project was facilitated by Michael Cohen, then an attorney for the Trump Organization, and from January 2017 to May 2018 Trump's personal attorney. Trump signed a nonbinding \"letter of intent\" dated October 13, 2015, to proceed with the project. The letter, also signed by Russian investor Andrei Rozov, was forwarded to Cohen by Russian-American real estate developer Felix Sater, who had worked with The Trump Organization on prior deals, including Trump SoHo and Trump International Hotel & Residence. Sater has also been involved in criminal activities involving organized crime and has served as an informant to the FBI relating to those activities. He boasted to Cohen about his connections to Vladimir Putin, saying in an email to Cohen on November 13, 2015, \"Buddy our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putins [sic] team to buy in on this. I will manage this process.\" He also asserted that he had secured financing for the project through the Russian state-owned VTB Bank, which was under sanctions by the United States government. Cohen emailed Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in January 2016 to request assistance in advancing the project and later stated he didn't recall receiving a response. Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee in September 2017 that the deal was abandoned in January 2016, but in November 2018 admitted in a guilty plea that he had minimized Trump's role in the plans \"to be consistent with [Trump's] political messaging\" and that negotiations had actually extended through June 2016. Cohen also admitted that Peskov's office had, in fact, replied to his January 2016 email and discussed the deal with him on the phone. In a sentencing memorandum filed the day after his guilty plea, Cohen's attorneys stated he kept Trump \"apprised\" of the \"substantive conversation\" Cohen had with the Russian official, and discussed with Trump traveling to Russia to advance the project during the summer of 2016. BuzzFeed News reported on March 12, 2018, that Mueller's investigators had questioned Sater, and on April 13, 2018, reported that a former Russian spy had helped secure financing for the project. In 2010, Sater was provided business cards describing himself as \"Senior Advisor to Donald Trump\" with an email address at TrumpOrg.com. In a 2013 sworn affidavit, Trump said \"If [Sater] were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,\" and in 2015 he stated \"Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it. I'm not that familiar with him.\"The Trump team issued multiple denials of any contacts between Trump associates and Russia, but many of those denials turned out to be false. On December 4, 2017, in a court filing requesting that the judge revoke Manafort's bond agreement, prosecutors stated that Paul Manafort had worked with a Russian intelligence official to draft an op-ed essay while he was out on bail.\n\nThe New York Times reported, on March 28, 2018, that former Trump campaign deputy chairman Rick Gates had, in September and October 2016, frequently communicated with a man that the FBI believes is a former agent of GRU, Russia's largest foreign intelligence agency, and who had maintained active links with Russian intelligence during these communications; this disclosure was written into a court sentencing document for Alex van der Zwaan, submitted by Robert Mueller. Identified in the document as \"Person A\", The Times reported that the man matched the description of Konstantin Kilimnik, who, for years, was Paul Manafort's \"right-hand man\" in Ukraine. Gates reportedly told an associate that he knew \"Person A\" was a former GRU agent, although Manafort told associates he was not aware of such a connection. The Times reported on January 8, 2019, that in spring 2016 Gates and Manafort gave polling data, some of which was private to the Trump campaign, to Kilimnik, asking he pass it to Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov. During a closed-door court hearing on February 4, 2019, regarding false statements Manafort had made to investigators about his communications with Kilimnik, special counsel prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told judge Amy Berman Jackson that \"This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating,\" suggesting that Mueller's office continued to examine a possible agreement between Russia and the Trump campaign.Reuters reported on March 29, 2018, that the special counsel is examining an event at the 2016 Republican National Convention at which Jeff Sessions had conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Investigators are also looking into how and why language deemed hostile to Russia was removed from the Republican party's platform document during the convention. Mueller's office is also inquiring whether Sessions had private conversations with Kislyak at a Trump speech at the Mayflower Hotel in April 2016.The Steele dossier asserted that Trump attorney Michael Cohen in August 2016 had a clandestine meeting with Kremlin representatives in Prague. Cohen has stated he has never been to Prague, inviting investigators to examine his passport. McClatchy reported on April 13, 2018, that Mueller's investigators have evidence that in August or early September 2016 Cohen traveled to Prague by way of Germany. Such a trip would not have required a passport as Germany and the Czech Republic are in the Schengen Area which has abolished passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders. On April 14, 2018, Cohen again denied he had ever been to Prague, although weeks after the 2016 election he had told journalist David Corn he had been in Prague fourteen years earlier. McClatchy reported in December 2018 that a mobile phone traced to Cohen had \"pinged\" cellphone towers around Prague in late summer 2016. McClatchy also reported that during that time an eastern European intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Russians, one of whom mentioned that Cohen was in Prague. The Mueller Report did not conclude Cohen had been in Prague, citing his testimony to investigators.\n\nOn July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released a heavily redacted version of the October 2016 FISA warrant application for Carter Page, which stated in part \"The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government\" and \"the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1's campaign.\" The application also stated [A]ccording to Source #1, Divyekin [who is assessed as Igor Nikolayevich Divyekin] had met secretly with Page and that their agenda for the meeting included Divyekin raising a dossier or \"kompromat\" that the Kremlin possessed on Candidate #2 and the possibility of it being released to Candidate #1's campaign. The Steele dossier asserted that Page had secretly met \"senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN\" in Moscow on \"either 7 or 8 July\" of 2016, while Page was still officially with the Trump campaign, but did not refer to any kompromat.\n\n\n=== Alleged collusion between Trump campaign and Russian agents ===\n\n\n==== 2016 ====\n\nMueller investigated the meeting on June 9, 2016, in Trump Tower in New York City between three senior members of Trump's presidential campaign\u2014Kushner, Manafort, and Donald Trump Jr.\u2014and at least five other people, including Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Rinat Akhmetshin, a lobbyist and former Soviet army officer who met senior Trump campaign aides, Ike Kaveladze, British publicist Rob Goldstone, and translator Anatoli Samochornov. Goldstone had suggested the meeting to Trump Jr., and it was arranged in a series of emails later made public. In one email exchange of June 3, 2016, Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. that Aras Agalarov \"offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father\", adding that it was \"very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump\" that he could send to Donald Trump's assistant Rhona Graff. Trump Jr. responded minutes later \"Thanks Rob I appreciate that\" and \"if it's what you say I love it.\" Trump Jr. initially told the press that the meeting was held to discuss adoptions of Russian children by Americans, but after contrary media reports he added that he agreed to the meeting with the understanding that he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton. Mueller's team investigated the emails and the meeting, and whether President Trump later tried to hide the meeting's purpose. On July 18, 2017, Kaveladze's attorney said that Mueller's investigators were seeking information about the meeting in June 2016 from his client, and on July 21, Mueller asked the White House to preserve all documents related to the meeting. It has been reported that Manafort had made notes during the meeting. CNN reported on July 26, 2018, that anonymous sources stated that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell the Mueller investigation that Trump was aware of and approved of the June 9, 2016, meeting in advance, which Trump and Trump Jr. have repeatedly denied. CNN reported in the same story that Cohen attorney Lanny Davis had declined to comment for the report. The following day, The Washington Post reported a similar story coming from one anonymous source, although the paper did not specifically mention Russians. One month later, Davis identified himself as that source, clarifying that he could not be certain of Cohen's knowledge in the matter. Davis also asserted he had been a source for the CNN story. A CNN spokeswoman stated, \"We stand by our story, and are confident in our reporting of it.\"CNN reported on March 23, 2017, that the FBI was examining \"human intelligence, travel, business and phone records and accounts of in-person meetings\" indicating that Trump associates may have coordinated with \"suspected Russian operatives\" to release information damaging to the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\n\n==== 2017 ====\n\nBy August 3, 2017, Mueller had impaneled a grand jury in the District of Columbia that issued subpoenas concerning the meeting. The Financial Times reported on August 31 that Akhmetshin had given sworn testimony to Mueller's grand jury.CNN reported on September 19, 2017, that Manafort had been a target of a FISA wiretap both before and after the 2016 election, extending into early 2017. Some of the intercepted communications caused concerns among investigators that Manafort had solicited assistance from Russians for the campaign, although the evidence was reportedly inconclusive. The wiretaps began sometime after Manafort became a subject of an FBI investigation into his business practices in 2014. The Mueller investigation was provided details of these intercepts.Mueller is investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Republican activist Peter W. Smith, who stated that he tried to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers, and that he was acting on behalf of Michael Flynn and other senior Trump campaign members. Trump campaign officials have denied that Smith was working with them. In fall 2017, Mueller's team interviewed former Government Communications Headquarters cybersecurity researcher Matt Tait, who had been approached by Smith to verify the authenticity of emails allegedly hacked from Clinton's private email server. Tait reportedly told House Intelligence Committee investigators in October 2017 that he believed Smith had ties to members of Trump's inner circle\u2014including Flynn, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway\u2014and may have been helping build opposition research for the Trump campaign. Smith committed suicide in May 2017, several days after talking to The Wall Street Journal about his alleged efforts. Aged 81 and reportedly in failing health, he left a carefully prepared file of documents, including a statement police called a suicide note. An attorney for Smith's estate said in October 2017 that some of Smith's documents had been turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Wall Street Journal reported on October 7, 2018, that Smith had raised at least $100,000 from donors in his pursuit of the Clinton emails, that his estate had provided documents to the Mueller investigation, and that associates of Smith had been questioned by Mueller's investigators or a grand jury. The Wall Street Journal reported on October 10, 2018, that Smith had established a \"professional relationship\" with Flynn as early as 2015, and during the campaign was using Flynn's contacts to assist with his search for the Clinton emails. The Journal reported on October 19, 2018, that the Mueller investigation has evidence Smith may have had prior knowledge of the Guccifer 2.0 hacks. The Mueller report later confirmed significant aspects of Smith's efforts to locate the Clinton emails, including his communications about it with Flynn and campaign co-chair Sam Clovis, as well as Flynn's actions to spearhead the effort at Trump's repeated requests. In May 2019, an unredacted version of a December 2018 government sentencing memo for Flynn showed he had advised investigators that members of the Trump campaign had discussed whether to contact WikiLeaks about the release of emails.In December 2017, it was reported that the Mueller investigation was examining whether the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, who worked together on the digital arm of Trump's campaign, provided assistance to Russian trolls attempting to influence voters.\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\n\nYahoo News reported that Mueller's team was examining whether the joint RNC\u2013Trump campaign data operation\u2014which was directed on Trump's side by Brad Parscale and managed by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2014was related to the activities of Russian trolls and bots aimed at influencing the U.S. electorate. Also that month, the Democratic ranking members of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees asked their respective Republican chairmen to subpoena two of the data firms hired by Trump's campaign for documents related to Russia's election interference, including the firm headed by Parscale. On February 27, 2018, Trump selected Parscale to serve as campaign manager on his 2020 reelection campaign. NBC News reported on February 28, 2018, that Mueller's investigators asked witnesses pointed questions about whether Trump was aware that Democratic emails had been stolen before that was publicly known, and whether he was involved in their strategic release. This is the first reported indication that Mueller's investigation is specifically examining whether Trump was personally involved in collusive activities.\n\nMueller's investigators also asked about the relationship between Roger Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and why Trump took policy positions favorable to Russia. Stone, a longtime Republican \"dirty trickster\" and Trump confidant repeatedly discussed his backchannel communications with Assange and claimed knowledge of forthcoming leaks from Wikileaks. He also exchanged Twitter private messages with Guccifer 2.0, which American intelligence connected to two Russian intelligence groups that cybersecurity analysts have concluded hacked Democratic National Committee emails. The New York Times reported on November 1, 2018, that Stone and Steve Bannon exchanged emails in October 2016 about Assange's intent to release documents, and that Bannon and other former senior Trump campaign officials told Mueller's investigators of Stone's assertions that he was a conduit to Wikileaks and seemed aware of imminent document releases, although the \"top tier\" of the campaign was skeptical of Stone's claims. Reuters reported on May 16, 2018, that Mueller's office subpoenaed Stone's social media strategist, Jason Sullivan, the prior week to testify before a grand jury on May 18 and to provide documents, objects and electronically stored information. Reuters reported the next day that John Kakanis, Stone's driver, accountant and operative, was also subpoenaed.\nInvestigators also focused on Trump's public comments in July 2016 asking Russia to find emails that were deleted from Hillary Clinton's private email server. At a news conference on July 27, 2016, days after WikiLeaks began publishing the Democratic National Committee emails, Trump said, \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\" The July 13, 2018, indictment of 12 Russian GRU agents described ...on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton's personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.\nAfter a \"testy March 5 meeting, Mueller's team agreed to provide the president's lawyers with more specific information about the subjects that prosecutors wished to discuss with the president\". Then Jay Sekulow \"compiled a list of 49 questions that the team believed the president would be asked... The New York Times first reported the existence of the list.\"On April 30, 2018, The New York Times published a list of interview questions for Trump that the Mueller investigation had provided to the president's attorneys. The list was provided to The Times by an individual outside Trump's legal team. Among the questions was, \"What knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign?\" Before this disclosure, there had been no publicly available information indicating any such outreach. The Times noted that the questions were not quoted verbatim and in some cases were condensed. Written responses to some of the questions were provided to the Mueller investigation on November 20, 2018.The New York Times reported on May 15, 2018, that Trump campaign policy aide and later White House Deputy Cabinet Secretary John Mashburn testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2018 that he recalled receiving an email from George Papadopoulos in the first half of 2016 indicating that the Russian government had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Before this report, there had been no publicly available information indicating that Papadopoulos had informed anyone on the Trump campaign about such matters. Despite an extensive search for the purported email by various investigators, it has not been located. A court document Mueller's office filed in association with Papadopoulos's guilty plea included verbatim quotes from various emails Papadopoulos had sent or received, but the Mashburn email was not referenced in that document.\n\n\n==== 2019 ====\n\nOn March 22, 2019, the Special Counsel submitted their report to Attorney General William Barr. The investigation garnered 199 criminal charges, 37 indictments or guilty pleas, and 5 prison sentences.On March 24, 2019, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress detailing the special counsel's findings. The letter was split into 2 sections: The first section discusses Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the second section details whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\n\n=== Potential obstruction of justice ===\n\nShortly before firing him, Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into a member of the Trump Campaign, former National Security Advisor Flynn. In March, Trump reportedly discussed the FBI's Russia investigation with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and then CIA Director Mike Pompeo (who is currently serving as Secretary of State as of April 26, 2018), and asked if they could intervene with Comey to limit or stop it. When he was asked at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about the report, Coats said he would not discuss conversations he had with the president but \"I have never felt pressured to intervene in the Russia investigation in any way.\" Before being appointed Director of National Intelligence by Trump, Coats had been an elected Republican politician since 1981, serving in both the House and Senate.In a May 2017 interview with NBC News anchorman Lester Holt, Trump stated he was thinking of \"this Russia thing\" when he decided to fire FBI Director James Comey. Trump's statement raised concerns of potential obstruction of justice. In May 2018 Trump denied firing Comey because of the Russia investigation. In August 2018 Trump tweeted that \"Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia\", followed by his attorney Jay Sekulow asserting in September 2018 that NBC had edited the Trump interview. Neither Trump nor Sekulow produced evidence that the tape had been modified.In February 2017, it was reported that White House officials had asked the FBI to issue a statement that there had been no contact between Trump associates and Russian intelligence sources during the 2016 campaign. The FBI did not make the requested statement, and observers noted that the request violated established procedures about contact between the White House and the FBI regarding pending investigations. After Comey revealed in March that the FBI was investigating the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump phoned Coats and Director of National Security Admiral Michael S. Rogers and asked them to publicly state there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Both Coats and Rogers believed that the request was inappropriate, though not illegal, and did not make the requested statement. The two exchanged notes about the incident, and Rogers made a contemporary memo to document the request. The White House effort to push back publicly on the Russia probe reportedly also included requests to senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia, including Senator Richard Burr and Representative Devin Nunes, the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, respectively.\n\nIn May 2017, it was reported that Comey took contemporaneous notes immediately after an Oval Office conversation with Trump on February 14, 2017, in which Trump is described as attempting to persuade Comey to drop the FBI investigation into Flynn. The memo notes that Trump said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\" Comey made no commitments to Trump on the subject. The White House denied the version of events in the memo, but an FBI agent's contemporaneous notes are widely held up in court as credible evidence of conversations. In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, Comey gave a detailed report on the February 14 conversation, including Trump's suggestion that he should \"let go\" the Flynn investigation. Comey said he \"took it as a direction\u2026 I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.\" He added that it was \"a very disturbing thing, very concerning\", and that he discussed the incident with other FBI leaders, including whether an obstruction of justice investigation should be opened. Comey created similar memos about all nine conversations he had with the president. Mueller's office has the Comey memos, but on February 2, 2018, a federal judge denied multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to make the documents public, at least for now.The FBI launched an investigation of Trump for obstruction of justice a few days after the May 9 firing of Comey. The special prosecutor's office took over the obstruction of justice investigation and has reportedly interviewed Director of National Intelligence Coats, Director of the National Security Agency Rogers, and Deputy Director of the NSA Richard Ledgett. ABC News reported in June that Mueller was gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice, but a full-scale investigation had not been launched. On June 16, Trump tweeted: \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.\" However, Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow said Trump's tweet was referring to the June 14 Washington Post report that he was under investigation for obstruction of justice, and that Trump has not actually been notified of any investigation.The New York Times and Los Angeles Times reported on September 20, 2017, that Mueller's office had requested information from the White House regarding an Oval Office meeting President Trump had with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on May 10, 2017, during which Trump reportedly said that firing Comey had relieved \"great pressure\" on him.On January 23, 2018, The Washington Post reported that Robert Mueller sought to question President Donald Trump about the Flynn and Comey departures.The Washington Post also reported on January 23, 2018, that Mueller's office is interested in a May 2017 Oval Office conversation between Trump and Andrew McCabe, days after McCabe had automatically become acting director of the FBI when Trump dismissed Comey, allegedly for not pledging loyalty to the president. During this conversation, Trump reportedly asked McCabe for whom he had voted in the 2016 presidential election. McCabe, a lifelong Republican, replied that he had not voted in that election. On January 24, 2018, Trump denied\u2014or did not remember\u2014asking McCabe about his vote. Like Comey, McCabe also took contemporaneous notes of his conversations with Trump, which are reportedly now in the possession of Mueller's office.The New York Times reported on January 23, 2018, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was questioned the preceding week by Mueller's investigators. Trump previously expressed frustration that Sessions had recused himself from the investigation and not prevented a Special Counsel from being appointed, stating that he would not have appointed Sessions had he known that would happen. Multiple episodes have been reported in which Trump has threatened to dismiss Sessions, or Sessions has tendered his resignation. The Washington Post reported on February 28, 2018, that the Mueller investigation has been examining a period of time during the summer of 2017 when Trump seemed determined to drive Sessions from his job, to determine \"whether those efforts were part of a months-long pattern of attempted obstruction of justice\". Sessions' departure would allow Trump to appoint another attorney general who is not restrained by recusal. The New York Times reported on May 29, 2018, that the Mueller investigation is examining a previously unreported March 2017 episode when Trump attempted to persuade Sessions to reverse his recusal, suggesting that the investigation into possible obstruction of justice was broader than previously understood. The questions Mueller's office had previously provided Trump's attorneys for an interview with the president included, \"What efforts did you make to try to get [Sessions] to change his mind [about recusal]?\"USA Today and The New York Times reported on January 31, 2018, that Mueller's office is expected to question Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for President Trump's legal team, about his reported concerns that the president and his longtime aide Hope Hicks might have sought to obstruct justice. Corallo reportedly plans to tell investigators that Hicks told President Trump on a conference call that the Trump Jr. emails regarding his meeting with Russians \"will never get out\". Hicks' attorney denied the allegation. Mueller's investigators reportedly interviewed Hicks in early December 2017. Corallo had resigned from the Trump team in July 2017, reportedly because he became concerned that the president had obstructed justice.Bloomberg News reported on March 12, 2018, that the obstruction of justice aspect of the investigation is near completion and that Mueller may set it aside to conclude other aspects, such as collusion and hacking.\n\nThe New York Times reported on March 28, 2018, that in 2017, as the Mueller investigation was building its cases against Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, former Trump attorney John M. Dowd broached the idea of presidential pardons of the men with their attorneys. The Times reported this might have indicated concerns by Trump's legal team about what the men might reveal to investigators if they agreed to cooperate with the investigation in exchange for leniency. Although legal opinions vary as to whether this discussion alone would constitute obstruction of justice, prosecutors might present it as part of a pattern of activity that points to a conspiracy to thwart the investigation. CBS News reported on March 28, 2018, that Manafort is declining a plea deal and proceeding to trial because he is expecting a pardon from Trump, citing \"legal sources with knowledge of his strategy\". In May 2019, an unredacted version of a December 2018 government sentencing memo for Flynn showed that he advised investigators that both before and after his guilty plea \"he or his attorneys received communications from persons connected to the Administration or Congress that could have affected both his willingness to cooperate and the completeness of that cooperation.\"In a January 2018 letter to Mueller, Trump's attorneys asserted that Trump cannot unlawfully obstruct justice because the Constitution grants him full authority over all federal investigations and he can \"if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon\".Trump requested and received the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions the day after the 2018 midterm elections, following months of criticizing Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation, stating in July 2017, \"if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\" Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff since September 2017, as Acting Attorney General. While Whitaker was Sessions' chief of staff, White House chief of staff John Kelly described him as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ, which Trump considered hostile to him. Prior to joining the Justice Department, Whitaker had publicly criticized the Mueller investigation on several occasions, asserting it was \"going too far\", referring to it as a \"lynch mob\", and suggested it could be impeded by cutting its budget. Trump had seen Whitaker's supportive commentaries on CNN during the summer of 2017 and that July Whitaker was interviewed by White House counsel Don McGahn to join the Trump legal team as an \"attack dog\" against Mueller. During an interview with The Daily Caller on November 14, 2018, Trump was asked who he might be considering to assume the permanent attorney general position, mentioning Whitaker. Unprompted, Trump stated, \"as far as I'm concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought...It's an illegal investigation\".Days after Whitaker's appointment, Jerry Nadler, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asserted that Whitaker's appointment was \"part of a pattern of obstruction\" of the Mueller investigation and that Whitaker would be the first witness called to testify before the Committee. In an interview aired on November 18, 2018, Trump asserted he was unaware of Whitaker's previous criticisms of the Mueller investigation, later referring to one of Whitaker's previous statements, saying \"There is no collusion, he happened to be right.\" Trump added, \"I think he's very well aware politically. I think he's astute politically ... He's going to do what's right.\"According to a letter from Trump-appointed Attorney General William Barr, no conclusion was reached in the Mueller Report on whether or not Trump obstructed justice. As of March 24, 2019, the report itself has yet to be released.In May 2019, an unredacted version of a December 2018 government sentencing memo for Flynn showed that he advised investigators of discussions within the Trump campaign involving \u201cpotential efforts to interfere with the [special counsel's] investigation.\u201d\n\n\n=== Financial investigations ===\n\nThe Special Counsel investigation expanded to include Trump's and his associates' financial ties to Russia. The FBI is reviewing the financial records of Trump himself, The Trump Organization, Trump's family members, and his campaign staff, including Trump's real estate activities, which had been under federal scrutiny before the campaign. According to CNN, financial crimes may be easier for investigators to prove than any crimes stemming directly from collusion with Russia. Campaign staff whose finances are under investigation include Manafort, Flynn, Carter Page, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. At a New York real estate conference in September 2008, Donald Trump Jr. stated: \"And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\" McClatchy reported on April 6, 2018, that Mueller's investigators that week arrived unannounced at the home of an unnamed business associate of the Trump Organization who had worked on foreign deals for the company in recent years. The investigators had warrants for electronic records and to compel sworn testimony, and were reported to be particularly interested in transactions involving Trump's attorney Michael Cohen.Transactions under investigation include Russian purchases of Trump apartments, a SoHo development with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, transactions with the Bank of Cyprus, real estate financing organized by Kushner, and Trump's sale of a Florida mansion for $30 million over its appraised value to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev. The special counsel team has contacted Deutsche Bank, which is the main banking institution doing business with The Trump Organization. The Wall Street Journal reported on December 6, 2017, that Deutsche Bank received a subpoena from Mueller's office earlier that fall concerning people or entities affiliated with President Trump. The original Journal story incorrectly reported that Trump's records had been subpoenaed, which The New York Times reported on April 10, 2018 prompted Trump to tell his advisers \"in no uncertain terms\" that the Mueller investigation must be shut down, before Mueller's office advised his attorneys the report was inaccurate.\n\nKushner Properties\u2014from which Jared Kushner resigned as CEO in early 2017 to serve as a senior advisor in the Trump White House\u2014purchased the office tower located at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in 2007, just before Manhattan real estate prices fell in the Great Recession. The property has since experienced financial difficulties that the company has been attempting to resolve with new financing, without success, before the property's $1.2 billion mortgage comes due in February 2019. This effort has reportedly been complicated by Trump's election, which has caused potential lenders to avoid appearances of conflicts of interest. The matter has raised the interest of investigators who are looking at Kushner's December 2016 meeting with Sergei Gorkov, who said in a statement issued by his bank that he met with Kushner in his capacity as the then-chief executive of Kushner Properties, while Kushner assured Congress in a July 24, 2017, statement that the meeting did not involve \"any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind\". CNN reported on February 20, 2018, that Mueller's investigation has expanded beyond Kushner's contacts with Russia and now includes his efforts to secure financing for Kushner Properties from other foreign investors during the presidential transition. Kushner Properties sold the 666 Fifth Avenue building in summer 2018.Mueller took over an existing money laundering investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Manafort. On October 30, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Manafort and his associate Rick Gates on charges including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts, being an unregistered agent of foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, and false statements. Manafort's financial activities are also being investigated by the Senate and House intelligence committees, the New York Attorney General, and the Manhattan District Attorney.The Special Counsel will be able to access Trump's tax returns, which has \"especially disturbed\" Trump according to The Washington Post. Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, as presidential candidates normally do, has been politically controversial since his presidential campaign.The Special Counsel is also investigating whether the Central Bank of Russia's deputy governor, Aleksandr Torshin, illegally funneled money through the National Rifle Association to benefit Trump's campaign. On May 16, 2018, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report stating it had obtained \"a number of documents that suggest the Kremlin used the National Rifle Association as a means of accessing and assisting Mr. Trump and his campaign\" through Torshin and his assistant Mariia Butina, and that \"The Kremlin may also have used the NRA to secretly fund Mr. Trump's campaign.\" The NRA reported spending $30 million to support the Trump campaign\u2014triple what they devoted to backing Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. Most of that money was spent by an arm of the NRA that is not required to disclose its donors. Torshin, a lifetime NRA member, reportedly sought to broker a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in May 2016, but was rebuffed by Kushner. Torshin claims to have met with Trump at a Nashville NRA event in April 2015; he tweeted about the encounter in August, saying that Trump is \"a proponent of traditional family values\". Torshin spoke with Donald Trump Jr. during a gala event at the NRA's national gathering in Kentucky in May 2016, which Trump Jr.'s attorney Alan Futerfas characterized as \"all gun-related small talk\". Spanish authorities have implicated Torshin in money laundering and have described him as a \"godfather\" in Taganskaya, a major Russian criminal organization. On July 14, 2018, Butina was charged by the national security unit of the Justice Department with being an unregistered Russian agent who had attempted to create a backchannel of communications between American Republicans/conservatives and Russian officials by infiltrating the NRA, the National Prayer Breakfast and conservative religious organizations. On December 13, 2018, she pleaded guilty to conspiring with Torshin in this effort. The New York Times reported on July 17, 2018, that Torshin was scheduled to visit the White House in 2017, but the meeting was canceled after a national security aide noted Torshin was under investigation by Spanish authorities for money laundering.CNN reported on April 4, 2018, that Mueller's investigators have been examining whether Russian oligarchs directly or indirectly provided illegal cash donations to the Trump campaign and inauguration. Investigators were examining whether oligarchs invested in American companies or think tanks having political action committees connected to the campaign, as well as money funneled through American straw donors to the Trump campaign and inaugural fund. At least one oligarch was detained and his electronic devices searched as he arrived at a New York area airport on his private jet in early 2018; subsequent reporting by The New York Times identified the man as Viktor Vekselberg. Vekselberg was questioned about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments made to Michael Cohen after the election, through Columbus Nova, the American affiliate of Vekselberg's Renova Group. Another oligarch was also detained on a recent trip to the United States, but it is unclear if he was searched. Investigators reportedly have also asked a third oligarch who has not traveled to the United States to voluntarily provide documents and an interview.The New York Times reported on April 9, 2018, that the Mueller investigation is examining a $150,000 donation Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire, made in September 2015 to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in exchange for a 20-minute appearance Trump made via video link to a conference in Kiev. This transaction came to light in documents the Trump Organization provided to investigators pursuant to a subpoena earlier in 2018. The donation, the largest the Foundation received in 2015 other than from Trump himself, was solicited by his attorney, Michael Cohen. The Times reported that the subpoena had demanded \"documents, emails and other communications about several Russians, including some whose names have not been publicly tied to Mr. Trump\".Documents acquired by The New York Times in March 2019 showed that search warrants for Michael Cohen's emails were obtained by Mueller investigators in July 2017, with one warrant referencing a scheme \"to make an illegal campaign contribution in October 2016 to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump\". Nineteen pages of the documents relating to an \"illegal campaign contribution scheme\" were fully redacted.\n\n\n==== Cohen raids ====\nOn April 9, 2018, based on a referral to United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) from the special counsel, the FBI raided the New York City office, residence, hotel suite, and safe-deposit boxes of Michael Cohen, seizing records related to several topics. The FBI seized Cohen's computers, phones, and personal financial records, including tax returns, as part of the no-knock raid on his office in 30 Rockefeller Plaza. CNN cited unnamed sources saying the search warrant was \"very broad in terms of items sought\" and that it included bank records.The warrant was personally approved by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and carried out by the public corruption unit of the SDNY. Geoffrey Berman, the interim head of the SDNY, was recused from the matter; a Trump appointee, he had worked as a volunteer attorney on the Trump campaign. Further, due to the sensitive nature of the raid and the attorney\u2013client privilege, a special \"taint\" team is required to review the documents to carefully separate out privileged and protected documents that may have been seized in the raid to ensure those inadmissible documents are not passed on to investigators. Legal blogger and former federal prosecutor Ken White of Popehat published a New York Times op-ed giving some background on the DOJ procedures required to approve such a raid, saying the search \"suggests that the prosecutors believe they can convince a judge that communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen fall under the crime-fraud exception\" of attorney-client privilege. It called the raid \"highly dangerous\" for both Cohen and Trump. White posted further analysis on Popehat, citing section 9-13.320 [sic] [recte 9-13.420] of the United States Attorneys' Manual, which sets the guidelines and regulations for searches of attorney premises.\n\n\n=== Lobbyists ===\n\nIn August 2017, Mueller's team issued grand jury subpoenas to officials in six firms, including lobbying firm Podesta Group and Mercury LLC with regard to activities on behalf of a public-relations campaign for a pro-Russian Ukrainian organization called European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The public relations effort was headed by Paul Manafort, and took place from 2012 to 2014. The Podesta Group is run by Tony Podesta, and Mercury LLC is headed by Vin Weber, a former GOP congressman. Mueller is investigating whether the firms violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The Podesta Group announced in November 2017 that it would be permanently closing, with many of its employees moving to Cogent Strategies, a new firm founded by Podesta Group CEO Kimberley Fritts. Mueller's office later referred the matter to other federal investigators, who closed it in September 2019 without charges against Podesta or Weber.\n\n\n=== Trump as a subject of investigation ===\nFrom the beginning of his presidency Trump had requested assurances that he was not personally under investigation. FBI Director Comey told him so privately on three occasions but refused to make a public comment to that effect. In his letter dismissing Comey, Trump thanked Comey for \"informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation\". Comey later confirmed that this was true.In March 2018, Mueller's office reportedly informed Trump's attorneys that the president is not a \"criminal target\" but remains a \"subject\" of the continuing investigation. Trump's advisers were reported to be split in their interpretation of this, with some believing it was an indication that his legal exposure was low, while others expressed concern that Mueller was inducing him to agree to a personal interview, which his attorneys have discouraged him from doing for fear he might perjure himself and thus change his status from subject to target. The Post reported that Mueller also advised the attorneys that he is \"preparing a report about the president's actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice\". The Post referenced Justice Department guidelines, which explain:\n\nA \"target\" is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant.\nA \"subject\" of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation.\nTrump told reporters on January 24, 2018, that he was \"looking forward\" to testifying under oath to the Mueller investigation, perhaps in \"two or three weeks\", but added that it was \"subject to my lawyers and all of that\". The Wall Street Journal reported on February 25, 2018, that Trump's lawyers are considering ways for him to testify, provided the questions he faces are limited in scope and do not test his recollections in ways that amount to a potential perjury trap. Among options they are considering are providing written answers to Mueller's questions and having the president give limited face-to-face testimony. The Washington Post reported on March 19, 2018, that Trump's attorneys provided Mueller's office \"written descriptions that chronicle key moments under investigation in hopes of curtailing the scope of a presidential interview.\" In May 2018, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Politico that Mueller's team has rejected the proposal of providing a written testimony instead of an oral interview. Trump ultimately was not personally interviewed by the special counsel. In November 2018 he said he was preparing written answers to a set of questions, and in late November his legal team said he had submitted answers to the counsel's written questions about \"issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry.\"\n\n\n=== Other topics ===\nThe Intercept reported on March 2, 2018, that Jared Kushner and his father Charles Kushner made a proposal to Qatar's finance minister, Ali Sharif Al Emadi, in April 2017 to secure investment into 666 5th Avenue asset in his family's company's portfolio, when his request was not fulfilled, a group of Middle Eastern countries, with Jared Kushner's backing, initiated a diplomatic assault that culminated in a blockade of Qatar. Kushner specifically undermined the efforts by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to bring an end to the standoff.The New York Times reported on March 3, 2018, that the Mueller investigation had been examining possible efforts by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to buy political influence by directing money to the Trump campaign. Investigators had recently interviewed Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, and other witnesses, about this matter. Nader was reportedly a frequent White House visitor during 2017 and investigators have inquired about any policymaking role he may have had. Investigators have examined a meeting around January 11, 2017, in the Seychelles that was convened by the UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (known as \"MBZ\"), which Nader attended. Also present at that meeting were Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund, who is close to Vladimir Putin; and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, a major Trump donor and an informal advisor to the Trump transition. UAE officials reportedly believed that Prince was representing the Trump transition and Dmitriev was representing Putin. The Mueller report later found that Nader had represented Prince to Dmitriev as \"designated by Steve [Bannon] to meet you! I know him and he is very very well connected and trusted by the New Team,\" while Prince \"acknowledged that it was fair for Nader to think that Prince would pass information on to the Transition Team,\" although Bannon told investigators that Prince had not informed him of the Dmitriev meeting in advance. Prince testified to the House Intelligence Committee that \"I didn't fly there to meet any Russian guy,\" although the Mueller report found that he and Nader made significant preparations to meet Dmitriev. Although Prince characterized a second meeting between him and Dmitriev in a hotel bar as a chance encounter of no consequence, the meeting was actually pre-arranged after Prince had learned from calls back home that Russia had moved an aircraft carrier off Libya and he wanted to convey that the United States would not accept any Russian involvement in Libya.An aircraft owned by Andrei Skoch\u2014a Russian billionaire subject to U.S. sanctions\u2014arrived in the Seychelles a day before Prince himself did. The Washington Post had reported on April 3, 2017, that American, European and Arab officials said the Seychelles meeting was \"part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump\". Prince denied in November 30, 2017, House Intelligence Committee testimony that he had represented the Trump transition or that the meeting involved any back-channel. The Washington Post reported on March 7, 2018, that Mueller has gathered evidence that contradicts Prince, and ABC News reported on April 6, 2018, that Nader had met with Prince at a Manhattan hotel days before the Seychelles meeting and later provided him with biographical information about Dmitriev. CNN reported on March 6, 2018, that Nader had been detained and questioned by the FBI at Dulles International Airport as he returned from a trip abroad on January 17, 2018.Agents with search warrants copied the contents of Nader's electronic devices and served him with a subpoena to appear before a grand jury on January 19. CNN also reported that Nader had attended a December 2016 meeting in New York attended by MBZ; UAE ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba; and at least three Trump senior associates: Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner. The Wall Street Journal reported on April 2, 2018, that Mueller's investigators have inquired about the work done by a private consulting company, Wikistrat, on behalf of the UAE. One of the firm's co-founders, Joel Zamel, has reportedly been asked about his work with certain clients and his business relationship with George Nader. The Journal reported that, like Nader, Zamel had tried to forge a relationship with the new Trump administration.The New York Times reported on April 4, 2018, that Nader has a history of dealings with Russia dating back to at least 2012, when he brokered a $4.2 billion arms deal between Russia and Iraq, and attended an invitation-only conference in Moscow organized by close associates of Vladimir Putin. Nader has reportedly traveled frequently to Russia on behalf of the UAE, accompanying MBZ on many of those trips, and has had his photo taken with Putin. Nader has reportedly received at least partial immunity for his cooperation with the Mueller investigation. The Times also reported that Joel Zamel had been stopped at Reagan International Airport in February 2018, had his electronic devices briefly seized, and later testified before the Mueller grand jury about his relationship with Nader. The New York Times reported on May 19, 2018, that Trump Jr. met with Nader, Prince and Zamel in Trump Tower on August 3, 2016. Nader reportedly told Trump Jr. the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the election. According to Trump Jr.'s attorney Alan Futerfas, Zamel pitched a social media manipulation campaign from his Israeli company Psy-Group, although Zamel's attorney Marc Mukasey denied this. Trump Jr. reportedly responded favorably according to one source, although Futerfas denied this. Nader subsequently had frequent meetings with Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner. After Trump's election, Nader paid Zamel a large sum of money of up to $2 million. The Times reported that Prince had arranged the August 2016 meeting; Prince had stated in his November 30, 2017, testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that he had no formal communications or contact, nor any unofficial role, with the Trump campaign. The Times reported on October 8, 2018, that sometime after March 2016 Rick Gates had solicited Psy-Group to present proposals for social media manipulation and opposition research against Trump's primary opponents and Hillary Clinton. Gates reportedly was uninterested in the Psy-Group proposals, as social media strategy was being developed inside the Trump campaign, and there is no evidence the Trump campaign pursued the Psy-Group proposals. The Mueller investigation obtained copies of the proposals and questioned Psy-Group employees.Axios reported on March 4, 2018, that it had seen a grand jury subpoena that Mueller's office sent to a witness in February 2018. Axios did not name the witness. The subpoena reportedly demands all communications, from November 1, 2015, to date, that the witness sent or received \"regarding\" Trump; Carter Page; Corey Lewandowski; Hope Hicks; Keith Schiller; Michael Cohen; Paul Manafort; Rick Gates; Roger Stone; and Steve Bannon. A subsequent report by NBC News stated that the subpoena also encompasses \"work papers, telephone logs, and other documents\". On March 5, 2018, the witness was identified as Sam Nunberg, who served as a communications consultant on the Trump campaign until August 2, 2015, and later as an informal adviser. Nunberg stated that he had been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury on March 9, 2018, but he would refuse to appear or provide any of the subpoenaed documents. After multiple defiant television appearances on March 5, 2018, Nunberg indicated the next day that he planned to comply with the subpoena.The New Yorker reported on March 5, 2018, that Christopher Steele spoke with Mueller's investigators in September 2017. The magazine asserted that Steele discussed another document he had authored in November 2016\u2014after the Steele dossier\u2014that describes discussions \"a senior Russian official\" had heard inside the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: that the Kremlin had asked Trump \"through unspecified channels\" to not appoint Mitt Romney as Secretary of State. As a presidential candidate in 2012, Romney described Russia as \"our number one geopolitical foe\". After publicly considering Romney as Secretary of State, Trump ultimately selected Rex Tillerson, who has a long history of business dealings in Russia and was awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin in 2013.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on March 6, 2018, that Mueller's office had requested documents and interviewed witnesses regarding activities of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer. Investigators are reported to be interested in at least two episodes relating to Russian interests, including the proposed construction of Trump Tower Moscow and \"a Russia-friendly peace proposal for Ukraine that was delivered to Cohen by an Ukrainian lawmaker one week after Trump took office\". The New York Times reported, on January 10, 2019, that Mueller investigators, and other federal prosecutors, were investigating the activities of over a dozen Russia-aligned Ukrainian political and business figures who attended the Trump inauguration, ostensibly promoting a pro-Russian \"peace plan\" for Ukraine that included the lifting of sanctions against Russia. Andrey Artemenko, a Ukrainian politician who attended the Trump inaugural, was interviewed by the FBI and the Mueller grand jury, having met, days after the inaugural, with Trump attorney Michael Cohen and former Trump business associate Felix Sater, in New York, to present a proposal. Cohen hand-delivered Artemenko's proposal to Michael Flynn one week before Flynn resigned as national security advisor.The New York Times reported on March 7, 2018, that the Mueller investigation is aware of conversations Trump had with two witnesses regarding their testimony with investigators. In one conversation, Trump asked White House counsel Don McGahn to issue a statement denying a story The Times published in January 2018. That story reported that McGahn told investigators Trump had ordered him to direct the Justice Department to dismiss Mueller. McGahn never issued the statement and reportedly told Trump that the president had, in fact, told him to have Mueller dismissed. The New York Times reported on August 18, 2018, that McGahn had been cooperating extensively with the Mueller investigation for several months and that he and his lawyer had become concerned that Trump \"had decided to let Mr. McGahn take the fall for decisions that could be construed as obstruction of justice, like the Comey firing, by telling the special counsel that he was only following shoddy legal advice from Mr. McGahn\". Trump also asked his former chief of staff Reince Priebus how his interview with investigators had gone and whether they were \"nice\". The Times reported that although \"legal experts\" thought the conversations probably did not constitute witness tampering, witnesses and attorneys who became aware of the conversations reported them to Mueller.The New York Times reported on March 15, 2018, that the Mueller investigation had subpoenaed documents from The Trump Organization, including all documents related to Russia. Although the full scope of the subpoena was not clear, it was the first known time investigators demanded documents from Trump's businesses. The Los Angeles Times reported the same day that the special counsel's office had also subpoenaed the Trump campaign for documents.The Daily Beast reported on March 22, 2018, that Mueller had taken over the probe into Guccifer 2.0 from the FBI.NBC News reported on March 30, 2018, that Ted Malloch, a London-based American professor and author who worked with the Trump campaign, had been detained and questioned by the FBI two days earlier as he arrived at Boston Logan Airport after a flight from London. He was served with a subpoena to appear for questioning by Mueller's investigators on April 13, and presented with a warrant to have his phone seized and searched. Malloch told NBC in an email that FBI agents asked him a variety of questions, including about Roger Stone, author Jerome Corsi, and WikiLeaks. CNN reported that Malloch has written a forthcoming book alleging a \"deep state\" within the United States government fabricated the Steele dossier to destroy Trump. Corsi was subpoenaed for questioning by Mueller's investigators in September 2018, and by November he was facing perjury charges. That month, a draft court filing showed Corsi and Stone had exchanged emails in summer 2016 indicating their knowledge of impending email \"dumps\" by Wikileaks. In one email, Stone directed Corsi to contact Assange, which Corsi told investigators he had ignored, although investigators found he had passed the directive to an associate in London, whom Corsi later identified as Malloch.Michael R. Caputo, a former communications adviser for the Trump campaign, was interviewed by Mueller's investigators on May 2, 2018. Caputo was recruited to the Trump campaign by Paul Manafort and had previously worked with Russian politicians. A long-time associate of Roger Stone, Caputo stated after his interview, \"It's clear they are still really focused on Russia collusion. They know more about the Trump campaign than anyone who ever worked there.\"CNN reported on May 5, 2018, that Mueller's investigators had interviewed Trump's close friend and inaugural committee chairman Tom Barrack in December 2017, asking him primarily about his relationship with Manafort and Gates, although The Associated Press reported the interview was broader and included campaign finance matters.On May 9, 2018, CNBC reported that Mueller's office had contacted telecommunications giant AT&T regarding payments totalling at least $200,000, but possibly as high as $600,000, made to a company founded by Michael Cohen in order to gain \"insights\" into the incoming Trump administration. An AT&T spokesperson said that they had provided all the information requested by the Special Counsel in November and December 2017.Glenn R. Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on August 22, 2017, that the FBI told Christopher Steele\u2014and then Steele told Simpson\u2014that the FBI had \"a human source from inside the Trump organization\" (and, more specifically, \"an internal Trump campaign source\"). Simpson did not indicate when Steele received this information or when he conveyed it to Simpson. The Washington Post reported on May 8, 2018, that a longtime FBI and CIA informant had provided information about connections between Russia and the Trump campaign to FBI investigators early in their investigation. This sparked speculation that the FBI had planted a \"mole\" inside the Trump campaign, although it was not clear that the individual Simpson described was the same individual described by The Post. The Washington Post reported on May 9, 2018, that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes subpoenaed the Justice Department to provide him with all documents regarding the longtime informant; The Post quoted the subpoena as demanding \"all documents referring or related to the individual referenced in Chairman Nunes' April 24, 2018, classified letter to Attorney General Sessions\", although Nunes denied he had referred to any specific individual. The Justice Department resisted on the grounds that revealing the information could endanger the life of a longtime top-secret informant for the FBI and CIA, and the Trump White House\u2014with the president's agreement\u2014sided with the Justice Department. The New York Times reported on May 16, 2018, that at least one government informant had met several times with Trump campaign aides Carter Page and George Papadopoulos.The Washington Post noted on January 9, 2018, that the source Simpson had referred to may not necessarily have been an informant willingly or directly, or during the campaign, but rather may have become an informant as a result of later becoming implicated in wrongdoing. Natasha Bertrand, then with Business Insider, reported on January 3, 2018, that a source told her Simpson had been referring to George Papadopoulos, who had first been interviewed by the FBI seven days after Trump's inauguration and whose cooperation with the FBI\u2014to \"provide information regarding any and all matters as to which the Government deems relevant\"\u2014began with his arrest on July 27, 2017, and was not publicly known until his indictment in October 2017. The New York Times reported on May 18, 2018, that the FBI sent an informant to meet with George Papadopoulos in late-summer 2016, and to meet repeatedly with Carter Page over ensuing months, after the FBI had acquired evidence that the two men had suspicious contacts with Russians. The Washington Post reported the same day that the informant first approached Page at a symposium in Britain in July 2016, and in September 2016 invited Papadopoulos to London to work on a research paper. Late that summer, the informant also met with Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis in Northern Virginia. The informant was identified as an American academic who teaches in Britain, but both The Times and The Post declined to publish his name. NBC News identified him as Stefan Halper.The Washington Post reported on June 28, 2018, that the Mueller investigation, as well as British investigators, were examining relationships between the Brexit movement, Russia and the Trump campaign. The Post reported that Mueller's investigators had specifically asked two individuals, including former Trump communications official Michael Caputo, about relationships between Trump associates and Brexit leader Nigel Farage. Ted Malloch, who had worked with the Trump campaign and was later questioned by Mueller investigators, was reportedly close to Farage.ABC News reported on September 20, 2018, that Michael Cohen had been interviewed by Mueller's investigators multiple times since he pleaded guilty to charges a month earlier. The interviews covered a broad range of topics, including Trump's business dealings with Russians, alleged collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign and whether Trump or his associates had discussed a pardon of Cohen with him.In August 2018, a sealed court case was brought before Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the DC District Court, who oversees grand jury proceedings. The case bounced back and forth between Howell and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals over several weeks, as press speculation grew that the secret case was related to a witness challenging a Mueller subpoena. CNN reporters observed Mueller attorneys entering Howell's courtroom in September. CNN later confirmed that the case did involve a Mueller subpoena that was being challenged. The case was heard by a three-judge panel of the Circuit court on December 14, amid such secrecy that the entire fifth floor of the court building was cleared so reporters could not observe the proceedings or participants. Four days later, the judges ruled that the plaintiff, an unnamed foreign company, must comply with the subpoena. The company appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court on December 22, although the Court is not known to hear cases that are completely sealed. The Court denied the appeal on January 8, 2019.\n\n\n=== Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal ===\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on December 15, 2017, that Mueller's office had requested and received employee emails from Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that worked for the Trump campaign, earlier that year. The Washington Post reported on March 20, 2018, that Christopher Wylie, an employee of Cambridge Analytica until late 2014, said that former Trump campaign CEO and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon oversaw a 2014 effort at the company (which he co-founded) to gather Facebook data on millions of Americans and test the effectiveness of anti-establishment messages such as \"drain the swamp\" and \"deep state\", which became major Trump themes after Bannon joined the campaign in August 2016. Views of Russian President Vladimir Putin were also tested. The Associated Press reported on March 22, 2018, that the special counsel is examining the connections between the company, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, particularly how voter data may have been used in battleground states.Several news agencies reported on April 4, 2018, that the security of 87 million Facebook users' private data had been shared, without their consent, via Cambridge Analytica, influencing voters and helping Trump win the 2016 election. The New York Times reported on May 15, 2018, that the Justice Department and FBI were investigating Cambridge Analytica, although it was unclear if Mueller's office was involved in the investigation.\n\n\n== Cost ==\nBy December 2018, the investigation had cost approximately $25 million but gained approximately $48 million. More than half of the cost of the investigation was for personnel compensation and benefits. The gains were accrued primarily by uncovering unpaid taxes by targets in the investigation, seizing assets, and collecting fines.\n\n\n== Criminal charges ==\n\nThe Special Counsel indicted 34 people\u2014seven U.S. nationals, 26 Russian nationals, and one Dutch national\u2014and three Russian organizations. Two additional individuals were charged as a result of referrals to other FBI offices.\n\nCharges were filed against Trump campaign members George Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen. Charges were also filed against bank account seller Richard Pinedo, and lawyer Alex van der Zwaan as well as Paul Manafort associate Konstantin Kilimnik. Also indicted were Russia-based Internet Research Agency and related organizations and individuals directed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, and a group of Russian hackers referred to as Viktor Netyksho, et al. On March 16, 2020, the US government dropped the charges against Prigozhin-owned companies Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering.Following the guilty plea of Michael Cohen for lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee, ranking member Mark Warner stated the Committee had made multiple criminal referrals of individuals to Mueller and continues to examine witness testimonies for other false statements. The Democrat-controlled House Intelligence Committee voted in February 2019 to refer dozens of witness testimony transcripts and thousands of other documents to Mueller's office. Committee Republicans had blocked Democrat efforts to release the documents to Mueller's office when Republicans controlled the Committee in 2018.On January 25, 2019, Roger Stone, a long time advisor to Donald Trump, was arrested by the FBI at a pre-dawn raid in Florida. The indictment filed by the Office of the Special Counsel contained 7 charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding, witness tampering, and lying to congress in regard to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and his involvement with WikiLeaks. In the charging document, prosecutors alleged that, after the first Wikileaks release of hacked DNC emails in July 2016, \"a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign. Stone thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by [WikiLeaks].\" The indictment also alleged that Stone had discussed Wikileaks releases with multiple senior Trump campaign officials. By the time of those contacts, it had been publicly reported that the DNC emails had been hacked by Russians and provided to Wikileaks. Stone was convicted of all charges in November 2019, after the conclusion of the investigation.\n\n\n=== Indictments ===\nA total of thirty-four individuals and three companies were indicted by Mueller's investigators. Eight have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including five Trump associates and campaign officials. None of those five convictions \"involved a conspiracy between the campaign and Russians\" and \"Mueller did not charge or suggest charges for  [...] whether the Trump campaign worked with the Russians to influence the election\". The investigation was, however, more complex. On May 29, 2019, In a press conference, Mueller stated that \"If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime... A president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view \u2013 that too is prohibited.\"Dozens of ongoing investigations originally handled by the Special Counsel's office were forwarded to district and state prosecutors, other Department of Justice (DoJ) branches, and other federal agencies. The following (in alphabetical order) were indicted during the Mueller investigation:\n\n13 Russians implicated in election interference: Mueller's team indicted thirteen Russian citizens and three Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency (IRA), for conducting social media campaigns about the U.S. elections, and twelve members of the Russian GRU cyber espionage group known as Fancy Bear, for hacking and leaking DNC emails in June 2018. The other Russian indicted who was not a direct employee of Fancy Bear was Russian business tycoon Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was alleged to have served as the financier for the organization.\nMaria Butina, who had claimed to be a Russian gun activist, was investigated by the Special Counsel investigators and then prosecuted by the National Security Law Unit. She was imprisoned for espionage after entering a guilty plea.\nMichael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, pled guilty to making hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in violation of campaign finance laws, and was convicted for several unrelated counts of bank and tax fraud.\nLieutenant General Michael Flynn, who had been appointed as National Security Advisor by the incoming Trump administration, was dismissed from his position and later pled guilty to making false statements to FBI investigators about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition.\nKonstantin Kilimnik, Manafort's business partner in Ukraine, was indicted for witness tampering at the behest of Manafort; Kilimnik is suspected of working for Russian intelligence.\nPaul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman was found guilty on eight felony counts of tax evasion and bank fraud, pursuant to his earlier lobbying activities for the Party of Regions of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich. He later pled guilty to conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of justice; in total, he was sentenced to over seven years in jail in February 2018.\nGeorge Papadopoulos Trump campaign adviser was convicted for making false statements to the FBI.\nRoger Stone, a longtime Trump advisor who had met with a Russian person offering to sell derogatory financial information about Hillary Clinton, was indicted on seven charges of lying to Congress and witness tampering. He pled not guilty. The jury subsequently found him guilty on all seven counts.\n\n\n== Conclusions ==\n\n\n=== Report sent to Attorney General ===\n\nOn March 22, 2019, the special counsel's office concluded their investigation and sent a report to the Department of Justice where it was received by Attorney General William Barr. Barr, at Trump's nomination, had become Attorney General on February 14, 2019, gaining oversight of the investigation from Trump-appointed Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. Whitaker had assumed oversight from Rosenstein on November 7, 2018, after the resignation of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the investigation. Both Barr and Whitaker had been critical of the Mueller investigation before their appointments. Barr has faced bipartisan pressure to release the full report to the public, to the maximum extent permissible by law.On March 24, 2019, Attorney General Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress regarding the special counsel's findings regarding Russian interference and obstruction of justice. Barr said that on the question of Russian interference in the election, Mueller detailed two ways in which Russia attempted to influence the election, firstly disinformation and social media campaigns by the Internet Research Agency to cause social discord, and secondly computer hacking and strategic release of emails from the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and Democratic Party organizations. However, Barr quoted the report as saying: \"[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"On the question of obstruction of justice, Barr said no conclusion was reached by the special counsel, noting that Mueller wrote \"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him\". Barr and Rosenstein concluded that the evidence for obstruction of justice could not form the basis for a prosecution. On April 18, Barr and Rosenstein held a press conference ninety minutes before a redacted version of the report, titled Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, was released to Congress and the public. A less-redacted version is planned to be accessible to \"a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees\".\n\n\n=== Follow-up to Attorney General's letter ===\nThe New York Times reported on April 3, that some members of the special counsel had told associates that they believe Barr's letter did not adequately portray their findings, which they considered to be more troubling for Trump than reported. The next day, The Washington Post reported that members of Mueller's team, who spoke anonymously, reported that the evidence gathered on obstruction of justice was \"much more acute than Barr suggested.\" These members of Mueller's team revealed that they believed that the evidence showed Trump obstructed justice, but that the entire team could not draw a conclusion because they were split over the evidence and law. The Washington Post report did not explain why they believed their findings to be more serious than Barr's conclusions and it is unknown how many members of the special counsel hold these opinions.Barr's letter quoted Mueller's report as stating, \"the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\" leading Barr to write, \"the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\" and concluding, \"while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction.\" Some legal analysts challenged Barr's reasoning that Trump would not have intended to obstruct justice solely because he knew he had not committed a crime, noting that one can have intent to obstruct justice for other reasons, such as protecting associates from harm.\n\n\n=== Congressional requests for full report ===\nOn April 3, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee, which did not receive the unredacted report by its April 2 deadline, voted 24-17 along party lines to approve a resolution which authorizes subpoenas of the full report. The resolution also authorized subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump's former top advisers, including strategist Steve Bannon, communications director Hope Hicks, chief of staff Reince Priebus, former-White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Annie Donaldson.The Justice Department discussed the report with White House attorneys, and Barr discussed it in a April 18, 2019, press conference, a few hours before its release to Congress and the public later that day.On April 19, 2019, Nadler issued a subpoena for the release of the full unredacted report. On May 3, 2019, Nadler informed Barr that a subpoena had been issued giving him until May 6 to release the full unredacted Mueller Report to the House Judiciary Committee. On May 6, after Barr failed to meet the committee's deadline to release the full report, the committee agreed to hold a vote to start Contempt of Congress proceedings against Barr on May 8. A law issued in 1857 gives Congress the power to issue criminal charges for this matter. Trump's announcement of executive privilege came just hours before the House Judiciary Committee planned to vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt. On May 8, 2019, after Trump invoked executive privilege, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to reject White House's assertion of executive privilege and approve a motion put forward by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl) which states that a vote to hold Barr in contempt would not \"be construed as a directive for the Attorney General to violate Federal law or rules.\" In a 24-16 vote, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt.\n\n\n=== Release of redacted report ===\nOn April 18, 2019, a redacted version of the Special Counsel's report titled Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, was released to Congress and the public. About one-eighth of the lines in the public version were redacted. The report was in two volumes, the first about Russian interference in the election and potential involvement of Trump associates, and the second on possible obstruction of justice by Trump.\n\n\n==== Russian interference ====\nThe report concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election did occur \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" and \"violated U.S. criminal law.\"The first method detailed in the final report was the usage of the Internet Research Agency, waging \"a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\". The Internet Research Agency also sought to \"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\".The second method of Russian interference saw the Russian intelligence service, the GRU, hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign, including that of campaign chairman John Podesta, and also hacking into \"the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\". As a result, the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents, and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU's personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\"\n\n\n==== Conspiracy or coordination ====\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \"applied the framework of conspiracy law\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law\". They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.The report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\". The evidence was not necessarily complete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony.\n\n\n==== Obstruction of justice ====\nThe second volume of the report investigated the topic of obstruction of justice, describing ten episodes where Trump may have obstructed justice as president and one episode before he was elected, and analyzing each in terms of the criteria needed to constitute criminal obstruction. The investigation found both public and private actions \"by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations\". However, Trump mostly failed to influence it because his subordinates or associates refused to carry out his instructions. The Mueller team refrained from charging Trump with obstruction because investigators abided by a DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and they feared that charges would affect Trump's governing and possibly preempt a potential impeachment. In addition, investigators felt it would be unfair to accuse Trump of a crime without charges and without a trial in which he could clear his name. Since they had decided \"not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether to \"initiate or decline a prosecution,\" the special counsel's office \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct.\" The report \"does not conclude that the president committed a crime\", but specifically did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, because investigators were not confident that Trump was innocent after examining his intent and actions. The report concluded that Congress has the authority to take further action against Trump on the question of obstruction of justice, stating that no one is above the law.\n\n\n== End of investigation ==\nOn May 29, 2019, Mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and that the office would be shut down, and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time. Saying \"[t]he report is my testimony,\" he indicated he would have nothing to say that wasn't already in the report. On the subject of obstruction of justice, he said he had been prohibited by Justice Department policy from charging the president with a crime and that any potential wrongdoing by a president must be addressed by a \"process other than the criminal justice system\". This suggested that the investigation could now be picked up by Congress. He stressed that the central conclusion of his investigation was \"that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.\" He also stated: \"If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime\".The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees subpoenaed Mueller on June 25, 2019, with a letter saying that \"the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions.\" Mueller reluctantly agreed to testify publicly with a scheduled date of July 17. This date was later pushed back to July 24. During his testimony, Mueller answered Republican Representative Ken Buck that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after the president left office.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n== Investigations into origins of probes ==\n\nThere have been numerous calls and requests to open a counter-investigation into the origins of the FBI's Operation Crossfire Hurricane probe, with attention on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) documents against Carter Page and the Steele dossier.On April 9, 2019, Attorney General William Barr testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee. Barr announced that the Department of Justice will be \"reviewing the conduct\" of the FBI's Russia probe. \"I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016,\" Barr said. Barr also said that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz will be releasing a report on the FBI's use of the FISA process and related matters. The report is expected to be released in May\u2013June 2019. When asked whether he was suggesting that spying occurred, Barr said, \"I think that spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.\"During Attorney General Barr's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1, Barr again said he was looking into the origins of the FBI's Russia probe. \u201cMany people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant [referring to Stefan Halper] and a FISA warrant,\" Barr stated. \"I\u2019d like to find out whether that is in fact true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop a threat as it's being represented.\u201d When asked by Republican Representative John Cornyn \"Can we state with confidence that the Steele dossier was not part of the Russian disinformation campaign\u201d Barr responded \u201cNo. That is one of the areas that I am reviewing. I\u2019m concerned about it. And I don\u2019t think it's entirely speculative.\u201d When asked about FISA abuses by the DOJ and FBI during his testimony, Barr responded \"These are the things I need to look at, and I have to say as I said before, to the extent that there was any overreach, it was a few people in the upper echelons of the (FBI) and perhaps the department, but those people are no longer there\", Barr said.Barr appointed a federal prosecutor, John Durham, to assist in the investigation. On October 24, 2019, news media reported that Durham had opened a criminal probe into the matter, giving him the power to empanel a grand jury and to compel testimony.On May 7, 2020, the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released dozens of transcripts from the Russia probe.  Top officials from the Obama administration had testified that they had no empirical evidence of links between Trump associates and Russian officials.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNobody Is Above the Law, a nationwide protest held on November 8, 2018\nSpecial Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, a proposed law that sought to protect the investigation\nRussian espionage in the United States\nRussia involvement in regime change\nRT America, the American arm of the RT network\nRussian interference in the 2016 United States elections\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull redacted report from the Special Counsel.

It briefly served as the first location of Mercy Hospital in Des Moines.  In 1907 it became the clubhouse of the Des Moines Women's Club.  The Club added an art gallery, the first public art museum in the city. In 1923, a 1400-seat auditorium was completed for Club programs.In 1995, the Hoyt Sherman Place Foundation was founded by the Des Moines Women's Club.  Ownership of the house and all art and artifacts contained in it were given to the foundation by the Des Moines Women's Club.  The Club also provided an endowment, which was increased by the sale of the painting To the Memory of Cole by Frederic Edwin Church. In 2017 the Hoyt Sherman Place Foundation completed restoration of all major paintings in the collection.The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.  In 2015 Hoyt Sherman Place was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.hoytsherman.org \u2013 Official website\nwww.desmoineswomensclub.com \u2013 Des Moines Women's Club\nIowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame",

        "wiki": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Andrew Yang, an attorney, entrepreneur, and the founder of Venture for America, began on November 6, 2017, when Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic primaries. Yang suspended his campaign on February 11, 2020, the night of the New Hampshire primary. On March 10, 2020, Yang endorsed Joe Biden for president.\nIn April 2018, Yang released The War on Normal People, a book discussing job displacement, automation, and universal basic income (UBI), which are central to his campaign. Initially considered a longshot candidate, Yang gained significant support in early 2019 after appearing on the popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. He later appeared on numerous other podcasts, shows, and interviews during his campaign. Yang's rise in notability was accompanied by the development of a devoted online fanbase that was known as the \"Yang Gang\". In 2019, his campaign raised $1.7 million, $2.8 million, $10 million, and $16.5 million in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters, respectively. In 2020, Yang raised $6.7 million in January before suspending his campaign in February. Yang ultimately received about $41.6 million over the course of his campaign. Yang qualified for and participated in all six Democratic primary debates held in 2019. In 2020, Yang did not meet the polling requirement for the seventh debate, but he later qualified for and participated in the eighth debate.\nYang's campaign strongly focused on the displacement of American workers through automation, a problem Yang claims was a major reason Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. To remedy this, Yang proposed the \"Freedom Dividend,\" a monthly UBI of $1,000 to every American adult. Another key aspect of his candidacy was what he called \"Human-Centered Capitalism\", which would have replaced several traditional economic metrics with an \"American Scorecard\". Yang initially supported Medicare for All, but later proposed preserving private health insurance. On electoral reform, Yang supported ranked-choice voting and the implementation of \"Democracy Dollars\" to drown out corporate donations. Yang proposed a version of the Green New Deal that would reduce dependence on fossil fuels through policies such as a carbon tax and support for nuclear power. Yang's other policies included the decriminalization of opiates and legalization of cannabis, support for abortion rights and LGBT rights, and stricter gun control measures.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nYang graduated from Brown University in 1996, concentrating in economics and political science. He then attended Columbia Law School, earning a Juris Doctor in 1999. In 2011, Yang founded Venture for America (VFA), a nonprofit organization that encourages entrepreneurship by matching recent college graduates with startups in various cities across the United States. In 2012, President Barack Obama recognized Yang as a \"Champion of Change\" for his work with VFA. In 2015, Obama further recognized Yang as a \"Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship\". Yang stepped down as VFA's leader in March 2017.Yang has stated that he first took an interest in universal basic income (UBI) after reading Martin Ford's book Rise of the Robots. Andy Stern's book, Raising the Floor, further persuaded Yang to support UBI.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\n\n\n=== 2017\u201318 ===\n\nYang's candidacy began on November 6, 2017, when he filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic primaries. Andrew Yang was the second Democrat to announce his candidacy for the presidency. The campaign began with a small initial staff working out of an apartment owned by Yang's mother. He is running on the slogans \"Humanity First\" and \"Make America Think Harder\" (MATH). According to BBC, Yang \"is one of the first and most recognizable East Asian-Americans in history to run for president\". He has stated that he hopes his \"campaign can inspire Asian Americans to be engaged in politics.\" Had he been nominated, he would have become the first Asian American to serve as any major party's presidential candidate, and had he been elected, he would have become the first Asian-American president.On April 3, 2018, Yang released The War on Normal People, a book discussing technological change, automation, job displacement, the economy, and the need for a UBI. In a press release on April 19, 2018, he announced that he would be personally giving one resident of New Hampshire $1,000 per month in 2019 to show the effectiveness of his UBI policy, the \"Freedom Dividend\".

He said that his supporters had gathered three times the required signatures, but \"because of a bureaucratic paperwork issue caused by an awkwardly-worded law, nearly 3,000 Ohioans' First Amendment rights have been denied.\" According to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, \"when Ohioans sign a petition, they deserve to know what they're signing. This is why petition forms must be submitted, complete with a statement from the candidate stating their intention to run. By their own admission, the Yang campaign failed to do that.\" On January 7, Yang's campaign staff unionized. On January 15, Evan Low, a member of the California State Assembly, became a national co-chair of Yang's campaign.\n\nOn January 23, former Democratic candidate Marianne Williamson announced that she would support Yang in the Iowa caucuses, but noted that it was not an endorsement.

Yang commented: \"I feel for the Democrats and the people of Iowa, but the fact is this was really an avoidable error that shot the party in the foot, and it's going to be harder to convince Americans that we can entrust massive systems with government if we can't count votes on the same night in a way that's clear, transparent, and reliable.\"Yang received 8,914 votes in the first alignment in Iowa, which was 5.1% of all votes cast.

A spokesperson for the campaign stated that the layoffs were unrelated to negotiations between the campaign and its unionized workers.\n\n\n==== End of campaign ====\nYang suspended his campaign on February 11, the night of the New Hampshire primary. Zach Graumann, Yang's campaign manager, stated that Yang no longer believed he had a \"real chance to win the nomination\", but wants to have a future in politics.

On April 27, Yang opened a lawsuit against the New York State Board of Elections for removing him and every other inactive candidate from the ballot and effectively canceling New York's primary. Yang praised a federal judge's order to reinstate the primary, saying \"I'm glad that a federal judge agreed that depriving millions of New Yorkers of their right to vote was wrong. I hope that the New York Board of Elections takes from this ruling a newfound appreciation of their role in safeguarding our democracy\".\n\n\n== Fundraising ==\nOn March 11, 2019, Yang announced on Twitter that he surpassed the fundraising threshold of 65,000 donors, which qualified him to participate in the first round of Democratic primary debates. On June 28, Yang announced that he reached 130,000 donors, which met the fundraising criterion for the third round of Democratic primary debates. By November 30, Yang had over 300,000 donors according to his campaign.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2019, Yang raised $1.7 million, of which more than $250,000 came from \"the last four days of the quarter\".

In the 72 hours after the third debate (held in mid-September), Yang's campaign raised $1 million, suggesting that it \"is on track to raise significantly more in the third quarter\" than in the second quarter, according to Politico.In the third quarter, Yang's campaign raised $10M, representing a 257% quarterly increase\u2014the largest growth rate among the fundraising numbers of all candidates.

According to The Washington Post, the campaign has raised a total of $15.2M and ranks first among all candidates \"in percent of money coming from small-dollar donations\".In mid-October 2019, the creators of a new super PAC, called Math PAC, announced that they would be spending over $1 million to back Yang's campaign \"so that a first-time candidate's voice isn't drowned out\". Vox noted that it will be \"a test for the candidate, who says he wants to eliminate super PACs\".On January 2, 2020, Yang's campaign reported that it had raised $16.5 million in the fourth quarter, representing a growth of 65%. On December 31, 2019, the final day of the quarter, the campaign raised $1.3 million in donations, which was its most lucrative fundraising day to date.On February 1, 2020, the campaign announced that it had raised over $6.7 million in January, including $1.2 million raised on January 31 alone.Yang ultimately raised about $41.6 million over the course of his campaign. Of this amount, about $39.8 million was raised by Yang's campaign committee while the remainder came from outside groups.\n\n\n== \"Yang Gang\" ==\n\nFollowers of Yang's campaign are collectively known as the Yang Gang or #YangGang. They have brought attention to his campaign on Reddit, 4chan, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other social media platforms, through the use of Internet memes and viral campaigning. Media outlets have noted that much of the content circulated through these platforms\u2014including memes, GIFs, podcasts, and Twitter tweets\u2014have been instrumental to the campaign. According to Mother Jones, Yang's supporters have coordinated on platforms such as Discord and Reddit in order to boost Yang on online surveys hosted by various websites, including the Drudge Report and Washington Examiner. According to Iowa Starting Line, Yang has been able to attract former Republicans, Independents, and Libertarians, and Yang believes that \"he could build a much broader coalition to beat Trump in 2020 than anyone else in the field\".On October 26, 2019, a march for UBI took place in New York City, and many of Yang's supporters attended. In South Carolina, there are more than 30 organized supporter groups, according to CBS News. In California, students and alumni from San Diego State University, University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Diego have participated in canvassing events for Yang's campaign. In addition, students from the University of California, Berkeley's Forward club, mobilized over 290 students to phone bank, canvass, and spread awareness for Yang's campaign.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\n\nOn multiple occasions, Yang's campaign and supporters have criticized media outlets, such as MSNBC and CNN, for their coverage of Yang. Incidents include cases of news outlets excluding Yang from lists of 2020 Democratic candidates or failing to mention Yang completely. On August 29, 2019, Yang supporters prompted the hashtag #YangMediaBlackout to trend on Twitter after a CNN infographic displaying the results of a poll included Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke but not Yang, even though the poll showed Yang polling three times higher than O'Rourke. Yang supporters have also criticized media outlets for providing disproportionately low coverage of Yang, pointing out that according to The New York Times, he has received some of the least coverage in cable news among the candidates, even though he was polling better than most of the field.On September 5, Yang tweeted that \"Sometimes honest mistakes happen. But NBC and MSNBC seem to omit me on the regular.\" He also provided several examples of omissions. In an evening broadcast on September 9, MSNBC misidentified him as \"John Yang\". The next day, Yang responded on Twitter, saying \"John Yang? That's a new one.\" The incident prompted the hashtag #WhoIsJohnYang to trend on Twitter. In early October, Yang called out CNN and MSNBC for excluding him in two fundraising graphics.\n\nIn early September, Yang's media coverage discrepancy was reported by several media outlets, including CNN. Axios noted that while Yang polling in the top six of the Democratic primary and \"getting plenty of online attention\", he was \"being treated by the media like a bottom-tier candidate\". Krystal Ball of The Hill observed that there was \"a persistent pattern of ignoring Yang's candidacy\" among media outlets such as CNN. Ball further noted that Scott Santens, one of Yang's supporters, \"has been keeping track of the apparent slights via Twitter\". On October 23, 2019, Santens released an article compiling the mainstream media's exclusions of Yang. In November 2019, Yang's campaign manager dismissed an apology by MSNBC for leaving Yang off of an infographic, which according to Santens's compilation, was the 15th time in the campaign cycle MSNBC or its related networks had wrongfully excluded Yang.On November 23, 2019, following the MSNBC-hosted November debate in which Yang received the least speaking time and was not called upon for the first 30 minutes of the two-hour debate, Yang publicly rejected a request to appear on MSNBC unless the network would \"apologize on-air, discuss and include our campaign consistent with our polling, and allow surrogates from our campaign as they do other candidates'\" An analysis from Business Insider found that Yang received significantly less speaking time at debates than would be expected by his polling numbers, and that Yang had the highest deficit between actual and expected speaking time of any candidate during any of the democratic debates. In November 2019, Business Insider reported that Yang is faring significantly better than many other Democratic candidates despite a lack of mainstream media coverage. In a December 2019 interview with NBC News, Yang suggested that him being Asian American may have played a role in the lack of media coverage. According to NBC News, some Yang supporters have \"resorted to harassment\", including targeting \"reporters who have written about or addressed criticisms of Yang\", but Yang has said that he does not agree with such behavior. In late December 2019, Yang ended his boycott of MSNBC stating that he prefers to \"speak to as many Americans as possible.\"In January 2020, MSNBC incorrectly referred to Yang as a \"billionaire\", and in the same month a CNBC graphic used a picture of Geoff Yang instead of the presidential candidate, also using a picture of Kirsten Gillibrand for Tulsi Gabbard. On February 7, The New York Times published an article based on some of the experiences of Yang's former employees, which Fox News describes as a \"hit piece\". It alleges Yang's insensitivity toward race and gender while discussing issues of racism and sexism, and circumstantial evidence for his social awkwardness, such as his having pressured employees to participate at company karaokes.\n\n\n== Democratic primary debates ==\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n==== First debate ====\n\nIn qualifying for the first Democratic primary debate, Yang met the 65,000 donor criterion on March 11, 2019. He also met the polling criterion, with 18 polls at 1% or higher.The Democratic National Committee determined at random that Yang would participate in the second night of the first debate, which took place in Miami on June 27. During the debate, Yang was asked only two questions. He had the least airtime of any candidate on both nights, speaking for a total of only two minutes and 56 seconds, which was less than one-fourth that of former vice president Joe Biden.After the debate, Yang, along with fellow candidates Marianne Williamson and Eric Swalwell, complained of microphone issues not allowing them to speak unless called upon when other candidates seemed to be able to freely interject at all times, though NBC denied the claim. The issues spurred frustration from Yang supporters and prompted #LetYangSpeak to trend on Twitter much of the following day. An NBC spokesperson said, \"At no point during the debate was any candidate's microphone turned off or muted\", but Yang and his supporters have provided video evidence they claim shows Yang speaking up but not being heard.\n\n\n==== Second debate ====\nThe criteria for qualifying for the second debates were the same as for the first debates. Yang was assigned to participate in the second night of the second debate, which took place in Detroit on July 31.During the debate, Yang answered questions on topics including civil rights, health care, immigration, party strategy, climate, and the economy. Yang spoke for a total of 8.7 minutes, which was again the least time of any candidate on both nights. He was the only second-night candidate who did not spend any time in \"back-and-forths\" with other candidates. Yang drew attention for his decision to not wear a necktie in either debate. In his closing statement, Yang called out the media and the debate format, saying:\nYou know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate? It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on the stage in national polling. It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs\u2014hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan\u2014we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show. It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president! We need to be laser-focused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common jobs in America may not exist in a decade, or that most Americans cannot pay their bills. My flagship proposal, the Freedom Dividend, would put one thousand dollars into the hands of every American adult. It would be a game-changer for millions of American families. If you care more about your family and your kids more than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com and see what a thousand dollars would mean to your community! I have done the math. It's not left, it's not right, it's forward\u2014and that is how we're going to beat Donald Trump in 2020.\nIn a September interview with Politico, Yang further clarified his stance on candidates attacking each other at the debates. According to Yang, there \"is this sense of manufactured outrage and rehearsed attack lines\", and as \"a proxy for the American public\", he finds \"the process to be very false and somewhat misdirected\".\"It's not left, it's not right, it's forward\" has been compared to a similar slogan used by the Green Party of Canada and the Dutch political party National Alliance.\n\n\n==== Third debate ====\nTo qualify for the third round of debates, \"candidates are required to both have 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent support in four polls\". On June 28, Yang reached 130,000 donors, thus meeting the fundraising criterion.After Yang had received what he considered to be his fourth qualifying poll, the DNC revealed that qualifying polls conducted by different organizations would not be counted separately if they were sponsored by the same DNC-approved sponsor. The ruling was controversially disclosed by the DNC on July 30, less than one day after Yang had obtained 2% in four polls, rather than on July 19 when the second of these polls had been completed. In spite of this, Yang qualified for the third debate after receiving 2% support in his fourth qualifying poll on August 8.The third debate was held in Houston on September 12. In his opening statement, Yang promised to \"give a Freedom Dividend of $1000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families\". During the debate, he addressed topics including health care, immigration, foreign relations, the War on Terror, corporate lobbying, and education and charter schools. Yang spoke for a total of 7 minutes 54 seconds, which was again the least time of any candidate.Some campaign-finance experts have questioned using campaign funds for payments such as those Yang promised in his opening statement, on the grounds that federal law bars personal use of campaign funds. However, Yang has said he has consulted lawyers about the proposal and that \"he would not gain the same scrutiny if he gave money to a media company or consultants\" instead of directly to Americans. On September 12, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian announced on Twitter his support for Yang's proposal and offered to finance it. On September 13, tech entrepreneur Justin Sun pledged to give $1.2 million to 100 Americans in 2020, saying that he wanted \"Yang to help him select the recipients\". In the 72 hours after the debate, Yang's campaign raised $1 million and collected \"more than 450,000 email addresses from people who entered the online raffle\", of which over 90% were new email addresses.\n\n\n==== Fourth debate ====\nThe qualification requirements for the fourth debate mirrored those of the third debate, and Yang qualified before August 22. The debate was held on October 15 in Westerville, Ohio. During the debate, Yang stated his support of impeaching Donald Trump, but that it would not solve the issues that got Trump elected, such as job displacement through automation. He also discussed the economy, taxation, foreign policy, the opioid crisis, big tech, and personal data as a property right. Yang spoke for a total of eight and a half minutes, which was the fourth-least time of all candidates.During the debate, Yang proposed decriminalizing opioids, a stance that candidate Beto O'Rourke agreed with. Candidates Julian Castro and Tulsi Gabbard said that Yang's Freedom Dividend policy \"was a good idea, and something they would consider if elected president\", while candidate Cory Booker argued for a $15 minimum wage over UBI. Vox called UBI one of the winners of the debate, saying that Yang's campaign \"has already elevated the idea in [American] policy discourse\". Chris Cillizza of CNN called Yang one of the winners of the debate, observing that Yang has had a \"remarkable rise in this race\" and \"is already having a significant impact on the conversation within the Democratic Party\". The New York Post similarly labeled Yang a winner, saying that he \"knows how to break through by speaking like a regular person\". On Twitter, Meghan McCain praised Yang for starting the conversation on automation, calling it \"incredibly impressive\".\n\n\n==== Fifth debate ====\nThe fifth debate was held on November 20. Yang spoke for a total of 6 minutes 43 seconds, the least time of any candidate. He discussed topics including artificial intelligence, foreign policy, child care, and combating white supremacy.Critics of the debate noted that it took over 30 minutes for the moderators to let him speak. Yang's short total speaking time and the long period of time before he was brought in sparked accusations from critics, including fellow candidate Tulsi Gabbard, of debate hosts MSNBC and The Washington Post suppressing Yang's speaking time. The incident sparked protests outside of the debate studio from Yang's supporters, who chanted \"M-S-N-B-C, hands off our democracy!\".During the debate, Yang said that climate change and artificial intelligence were among his top priorities. One notable moment was when Yang was asked what he would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin if he was elected President of the United States, and Yang responded that he would tell Putin, \"Sorry, I beat your guy.\"  On Twitter, Glenn Greenwald said: \"Yang's answer about the actual threats of the 21st century was way too smart, thoughtful and substantive for cable news and presidential political generally. Few things will affect humanity more than Artificial Intelligence in this century.\" CNN's Chris Cillizza listed Yang as among the debate's winners, saying that he \"came across as, by far, the most relatable candidate on the stage\". Chris Churchill of Times Union wrote: \"The other candidates blabbered on about millionaires and billionaires or the bad man in the White House while Yang, bless his heart, repeatedly turned the focus to families and children.\" Dana Brownlee of Forbes called Yang's closing statement a \"Mic Drop Performance\" and \"refreshing and riveting\".\n\n\n==== Sixth debate ====\nIn qualifying for the December debate, Yang met the donor requirement prior to August 15. By December 10, he had received the four required polls, becoming the seventh candidate and the only nonwhite candidate to qualify for the debate. Yang criticized the lack of minority participation during the sixth debate, and he later questioned a December 23 DNC fundraising video that excluded Tulsi Gabbard.The debate was held on December 19 in Los Angeles, California. Yang spoke for 10 minutes 56 seconds, the least time of any candidate. He discussed issues including foreign policy, the economy, climate change, impeachment, immigration, human rights, and racial equality. CNN's Chris Cillizza named Yang one of the winners of the debate, saying that \"Yang's answers on any question he was asked were miles away from how his rivals answered them\". Dylan Scott of Vox praised Yang's performance, saying that he \"nailed his answer on being the only nonwhite candidate on stage\" and that he \"made a short and eloquent case\" for the Freedom Dividend.\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n==== Seventh and eighth debates ====\nYang met the donor threshold, but did not meet the polling requirement to qualify for the seventh debate, which occurred on January 14, 2020. Yang suggested that the DNC commission additional polls in an attempt to increase the diversity of candidates, but the committee responded that it would \"not sponsor its own debate-qualifying polls of presidential candidates during a primary\", citing the established practice of using independent polling for qualification.On January 26, Yang qualified for the eighth debate, which was held in New Hampshire on February 7. According to editors of The New York Times, Yang gave the second-worst performance of the night. Jamelle Bouie said he \"knows how to turn a question to his priorities,\" but \"doesn't have anything to say beyond his pitch for a cash giveaway.\" Elizabeth Bruenig said he \"seems like a cool guy, and perhaps like the ideal candidate ... in a parallel universe where capital and labor cooperate with kindly comity.\" Will Wilkinson said, \"Yang has brought a welcome fresh perspective to the race, but he didn't have his best night.\"\n\n\n== Policies ==\n\nYang's platform has three main aspects: UBI, \"Human-Centered Capitalism\" and \"Medicare for All\", which he \"supports the spirit of\", but does not commit to. His platform also includes numerous other proposals; more than 160 policies are listed on his campaign website. Equal Citizens has given Yang's democracy reform policies an \"A+\" rating, the highest ranking also received by fellow candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard.Yang claims the problem of job displacement through automation is the main reason Donald Trump ended up winning the 2016 presidential election, stating that based on data, \"There's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in a community and the movement towards Donald Trump.\" Many of his policies, including the Freedom Dividend, are structured as a response to this issue.\n\n\n=== Freedom Dividend (UBI) ===\nYang's signature policy is the \"Freedom Dividend\", a $1,000-per-month universal basic income to all US citizens age 18 or older, regardless of employment status. Yang has stated that this will help compensate for the loss of jobs to automation and   artificial intelligence and that it will foster \"healthier people, less stressed out people, better educated people, stronger communities, more volunteerism, [and] more civic participation\". Citing forecasting by the Roosevelt Institute, Yang stated that the dividend \"would create up to 2 million new jobs\" in the US. The dividend is opt-in, and would not be given to those who choose to remain in certain welfare programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, WIC, and Supplemental Security Income. Other programs would stack on top of the dividend, including Social Security, unemployment insurance, housing assistance, and veteran's disability benefits.Yang proposes funding the dividend\u2014estimated to cost $2.8 trillion a year\u2014through several avenues, including a 10% value-added tax on business transactions, a 0.1% tax on financial transactions, taxing capital gains and carried interest at normal income rates, a $40/ton carbon tax, and removing the wage cap on Social Security payroll tax. According to Yang, a value-added tax is necessary to combat tax avoidance by major technology companies like Amazon and Google, which routinely use accounting tricks to pay little in income tax. Yang expects \"hundreds of billions in new economic growth and value\" to be generated through the dividend and that it would save billions of dollars on incarceration, homelessness services, and emergency room health care. On the topic of whether the dividend should include the wealthiest citizens, Yang stated that it should be universalized \"so it's seen as a true right of citizenship, instead of a transfer from rich to poor\". Yang does not support raising the federal minimum wage but supports each state's right to do so, citing his belief that the Freedom Dividend renders a federal minimum wage increase less necessary.Fellow 2020 Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren, Tulsi Gabbard, and Julian Castro have stated their openness to UBI.\nAt a 2019 conference organized by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, economist and Harvard professor Greg Mankiw said of the Freedom Dividend:\n\nI am attracted to something along the lines of the policy now being championed by Andrew Yang ... It's pretty easy to see how this idea would work. Value-added taxes are essentially sales taxes; they're used in a lot of European nations, and they've proven remarkably efficient ways to raise revenue, and because the dividend is universal, it would be simple to administer.\nSkeptics of UBI cite a decrease in the growth of automation and doubt that the impacts of new technology will be negative; according to Rich Lowry, \"as technology makes some jobs obsolete, it creates the space for new ones\". Contrarily, Yang has cited studies demonstrating that the retraining of displaced manufacturing workers had success rates of 0\u201315%. The National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that the dividend would cost over $3 trillion annually (more than three-fourths of the federal budget). Some UBI advocates believe that the Freedom Dividend would negatively affect low-income citizens; Yang's campaign clarifies that the cost of basic necessities would not increase significantly, while the cost of luxury goods would, and also that the dividend would decrease the amount of time spent \"interacting with an unwieldy bureaucracy\". Economics professor Melissa Kearney opines that UBI would not significantly reduce inequality, and that she has found \"no compelling evidence that ... giving people money will generally lead to any appreciable increase in work or successful business creation\".\n\n\n=== \"Human-Centered Capitalism\" ===\nYang has criticized several commonly cited economic metrics as misleading; for instance, he prefers labor force participation rate to the unemployment rate and believes that median income and life expectancy are more accurate at measuring the health of the economy than GDP. According to Yang, the economy \"systematically tends to undervalue many things, activities, and people, many of which are core to the human experience\". His proposal, Human-Centered Capitalism, will include \"measurements like Median Income and Standard of Living, Health-adjusted Life Expectancy, Mental Health, Childhood Success Rates, Social and Economic Mobility, Absence of Substance Abuse, and others\". The policy aims to make \"the economy work for Americans, not the other way around\", direct \"capital to investments to improve human welfare\", and create \"measurements around people, not dollars\".In response to GDP having little or no influence on each citizen's well-being, Yang has proposed to create an \"American Scorecard\" to capture \"the actual economic/well-being of the American people\". He has listed several measurable indicators of well-being, including \"Quality of life and health-adjusted life expectancy\", \"Happiness/Well-Being and Mental Health\", \"Environmental quality\", \"Income Inequality\", and \"Access to education\". According to Yang, the American Scorecard will help set \"policy goals against measurable indicators of well-being\" and \"measure progress on these goals\".\n\n\n=== Economy ===\nYang promotes equal pay for equal work and wants to alleviate the racial discrepancies in pay. He has also proposed to implement a mandatory paid-leave policy, which includes a minimum-leave policy for full-time workers and paid time away from work for contract workers. According to Yang, \"Americans often want to move for better job prospects but can't afford the costs.\" He wants to make it easier to move for work, and has proposed for the IRS \"to create a program to refund up to $1,000 of moving expenses for any American relocating for work\".Yang has proposed for personal data to be treated as a property right, saying: \"Data generated by each individual needs to be owned by them, with certain rights conveyed that will allow them to know how it's used and protect it.\" He opposes the deregulation of Wall Street, supports regulating social media as a public utility, and promotes a ban on robocalls. Yang has proposed a new type of credit system designed to incentivize traditionally unpaid caregiving contributions. He supports free financial counseling, stating that \"it's important to ensure Americans have the knowledge they need to save and invest properly\".\n\n\n=== Electoral reform ===\n\n\n==== Democracy dollars ====\nYang supports the implementation of what he calls \"democracy dollars\", where voting age citizens receive a $100 \"use it or lose it\" democracy voucher each year to give to candidates. The policy aims to drown out corporate money resulting from political lobbying and the decision of Citizens United v. FEC. According to Yang, democracy dollars would drown out corporate money from organizations, such as the NRA, by a factor of eight to one.\n\n\n==== Partisan gerrymandering ====\nYang proposes to end partisan gerrymandering. According to Yang, gerrymandering \"undercuts the basis of our representative democracy, and it causes people to believe their vote doesn't count\". He aims to promote the use of \"the efficiency gap to measure partisan gerrymandering when evaluating and drawing district maps\". He also wants to use independent redistricting commissions and appoint \"Supreme Court justices who support the use of sociological tools such as the efficiency gap to help end partisan gerrymandering\".\n\n\n==== Ranked-choice voting ====\nYang supports ranked-choice voting: \"each voter ranks their top three candidates. ... If one candidate received over 50% of the vote, they win the election. If no candidate hit the majority threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Then, everyone who listed that eliminated candidate as their first choice has their second choice considered, a process which continues until someone breaks 50%.\" Yang claims that ranked-choice voting will lead to higher voter turnout, better capture voter preferences, allow for more moderate candidates, and lower levels of negative campaigning. His policy aims to adopt a voting system that combats partisanship and \"better captures the will of the majority of voters\".\n\n\n==== Voting age ====\nOn April 3, 2019, Yang came out in favor of lowering the national voting age to 16. While other candidates have expressed openness towards the idea, Yang was the first to make it an official part of his platform. Through lowering the voting age, Yang aims to increase civic engagement and allow citizens \"to influence policy that impacts their economic futures\".\n\n\n=== Energy and climate change ===\nOn August 26, 2019, Yang released his climate change plan, which involved nuclear power, zero-emission transportation, geoengineering, a carbon tax, and a renewable electric grid. Yang supports a Green New Deal and favors a reduction in carbon emissions with an emphasis on climate engineering. In addition to revitalizing the Environmental Protection Agency, his platform calls for a Global Geoengineering Institute to form inter-governmental partnerships. Yang is a proponent of bringing the United States back into the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n\n==== Nuclear energy ====\nYang is a supporter of nuclear energy. He believes that the US should invest more in nuclear technologies like thorium-based nuclear power and generation-IV nuclear reactors since they are safer and produce less waste than uranium-based nuclear energy and are not capable of being weaponized. In his plan for energy transition to low-carbon sources, he plans to invest $50 billion in research and development and expects the first reactors to be connected to the grid by 2027. He has also stated that he wants to make it easier for nuclear power plants to open up and wants to increase the amount of nuclear energy used in the US.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nIn addition to UBI, single-payer health care used to be a fundamental aspect of Yang's platform. However, his policy proposal released in December 2019 eschews from it in favor of a plan that focuses more on lowering costs and expanding coverage. Prior to releasing the proposal, Yang clarified that while he supported Medicare for All, he \"would keep the option of private insurance\". He stated his goal was to \"demonstrate to the American people that private insurance is not what [they] need\" and that Medicare for All is \"superior to [their] current insurance\". He believed that such an approach will make holistic and preventive care more feasible. He also used to support free marriage counseling.  His policy proposal does not contain a public option. HuffPost described it as \"the most conservative health care plan in the Democratic Primary\".He has stated that the doctor shortage can be attributed to inadequate investment in patient care technology and an overemphasis on medical careers that require individuals to go through medical school.Yang has proposed increasing funding for the suicide prevention efforts of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He supports the creation and funding of mindfulness programs in schools and correctional facilities.\n\n\n=== Abortion ===\nYang is pro-choice. He supports \"the right to privacy of American women\" and the right for women \"to choose in every circumstance and provide resources for planning and contraception\". He has said that he would nominate pro-choice judges who \"support a woman's right to choose\". He also believes that UBI will reduce abortions being performed for financial reasons.\n\n\n=== Circumcision ===\nIn March 2019, after an anonymous Twitter user asked Yang if he had an opinion on routine infant circumcision, Yang responded that he was against the practice. Yang later called himself \"highly aligned with the intactivists\" (\"intactivists\" referring to opponents of the practice) and stated that \"history will prove them even more correct.\" Yang called the evidence for circumcision being medically beneficial \"shaky\" and suggested that as president, he would support giving new parents more information about this decision. However, Yang did not support a ban on the practice and later clarified that he supported the ability of parents to make this choice for religious or cultural reasons. Intactivists described this position as incompatible with their movement, with Intact America's Georganne Chapin describing his statement as backtracking and suggesting that it was simply due to political pressure. Major politicians commenting on infant circumcision has been rare, with Yang being the only candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination to discuss the issue.Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, himself an Orthodox Jew, disagreed with Yang's stance against circumcision. Yang invited him to talk further, and some outlets reported that Yang and Shapiro were going to have a public debate on the issue. However, Shapiro clarified that he and Yang were having a discussion rather than a debate and that their conversation would cover other issues rather than solely focusing on circumcision.Though white nationalists and anti-Semites also voiced agreement on online forums with Yang on his anti-circumcision stance, Yang rejected their support.\n\n\n=== Corruption and bureaucracy ===\nIn a New York Times article about his campaign, several of Yang's policies about corruption and the federal bureaucracy are detailed, such as the creation of a \"Department of the Attention Economy\" that would focus on regulating the addictive nature of social media, the hiring of a White House Psychologist to focus on mental health issues, making Tax Day a national holiday, and, to stem corruption, increasing the salaries of federal regulators but limiting their private work after they leave public service.\n\n\n=== Drug policy ===\nYang supports the legalization of cannabis and the decriminalization of opioids (including heroin) for personal use, but he does not support legalizing or decriminalizing cocaine. He cited the drug policy of Portugal, which he believes to be similar, as evidence of the potential effectiveness of his drug policy. If elected, he plans to pardon all prisoners serving sentences for low-level, non-violent marijuana offenses, and \"would high five them on their way out of jail.\"\n\n\n=== Gun control ===\nYang supports \"common sense licensing policy\" for firearms, the restriction of the ability of people with a history of violence, domestic abuse, or violent mental illness to acquire firearms, and the grandfathering of current gun owners and the offering of a one-time \"Good Gun Owner\" tax credit. He also supports the prohibition of the manufacture and sale of assault weapons, bump stocks, suppressors, incendiary and explosive ammunition, and grenade launcher attachments, the implementation of a perpetual voluntary federal buyback program, and a tax credit for gun owners to upgrade their guns to personalized guns so children and teenagers do not potentially harm themselves or others with the gun. Yang supports law enforcement training that emphasizes the de-escalation of situations involving firearms.Yang has advocated for gun companies to \"pay a fine when their product is used to kill an American\" in order to realign incentives to deal with the problem of arms manufacturers' stocks going up after mass shootings. He supports \"an increase in the availability of mental health resources\". Yang calls the act of buying a gun and using it in a mass shooting \"the last two steps\" for a mass shooter and says we must also tackle the various steps that cause a shooter to buy and use a gun in a mass shooting in the first place.Yang has proposed ending active shooter drills in U.S. schools, or making them optional. He has argued that \"the trauma and anxiety the process causes far outweigh the likelihood of a real-life shooting\", citing a statistic that \"the likelihood of a public school student being killed by a gunman is 'less than 1 in 614 million'\". He has also \"criticized several school districts across the country which use theatrical recreations including firing blank rounds at students and using fake blood to imitate a real mass shooting\".\n\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\nYang supports American international alliances such as NATO. He has pledged to return the power to declare war to Congress if elected. He would also create a position for secretary of cybersecurity. In regard to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Yang wants a \"two-state solution that allows both the Israeli and Palestinian people to have sovereign land and self-determination\". He called Iran a \"destabilizing force in the region\", while also stating that leaving the JCPOA was a \"strategic mistake\", and he is opposed to engaging in an armed conflict with the country because it would have \"no clear benefit for the American people\". Yang has backed a more aggressive policy toward Russia, saying that \"Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat, because they've been hacking our democracy successfully.\" He wrote to the Council on Foreign Relations:\n\nRussian aggression is a destabilizing force, and we must work with our allies to project a strong and unified face against Russian expansionism ... we need to expand sanctions against Russia, and Putin and members of his government specifically through the Global Magnitsky Act, in order to pressure the country to play by international rules.\nYang also wants a \"reset of the relationship with Saudi Arabia\" due to the country's actions in Yemen and the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nYang does not support making public colleges tuition-free, but does support investing in community colleges to drastically reduce their tuition. Yang proposed forgiving some student loan debt, improving efficacy of funds invested in education, and increasing the accountability of educational institutions. He supports affirmative action, believing that there has \"never been a truly objective process\" for college admissions, owing to \"preference for legacies\". He has said that he views the rising cost of tuition as one of the greatest issues facing higher education today. He identifies an increase in administration staff as the cause of the rising cost, and supports tying federal fund access to affordability and accessibility to curb the excess.Additionally, he is in favor of promoting vocational education and technical training as an alternative for college, saying \"College is being over-prescribed in this country. ... Georgetown has estimated that there are 30 million good-paying jobs out there that don't require a college degree. Most require some type of specialized training.\"\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nYang is a supporter of the DREAM Act, a bill that would protect migrants who entered the United States illegally as minors. He would create a new category of residency that would allow certain undocumented migrants to gain citizenship after 18 years in the country. He would implement new technology to secure the Mexico\u2013United States border, and increase financial support for ports of entry and environmental protections around the Rio Grande. Yang claims that immigrants are being scapegoated for the problem of job displacement through automation, stating that \"If you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants, you will find wall to wall robots and machines.\"\n\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nYang has promised to enact legislation that prevents discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. He believes that \"the protections of the Civil Rights Act should apply to LGBTQ+ Americans\".\n\n\n=== Miscellaneous policies ===\nYang has proposed to eliminate the penny, reasoning that pennies \"are expensive, environmentally damaging, and cost businesses time\". He also wants to extend daylight saving time all year, which, according to Yang, will decrease \"traffic accidents, heart attacks, and crime\" and increase \"exercise and economic activity\". Yang also believes that NCAA athletes should be paid, which will enable \"college athletes to participate in the massive wealth creation they enable for their institutions\". He supports legalizing online poker in all 50 states, the \"first legitimate candidate\" to do so according to Card Player.\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\n\nYang has received endorsements or explicit expressions of support from officials such as Steve Marchand, Mike Honda, and Teresa Keng, as well as individuals including Elon Musk, Casey Neistat, MC Jin, Anita Baker, Sam Altman, Tony Hsieh, James Felton Keith, Eliot Horowitz, Ethan Klein, Kirsten Lepore, Stephen Sean Ford, Greg Ellis, Marcellus Wiley, Simu Liu, Joe Wong, Daniel Negreanu, Faraz Jaka, Andy Stern, Tommy Chong, Dominique Wilkins, Eugene Gu, Bobby Kim, Mark Schultz, Adam22, Christina Hoff Sommers, Peter Boghossian, Lloyd Ahlquist, Ken Jeong, Steven Yeun, Chris Jericho, Penn Jillette, Dane DeHaan, Teri Hatcher, John Leguizamo, Ken Bone, and Dave Chappelle.Yang has received campaign donations from Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, actors Nicolas Cage and Noah Centineo, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, and Internet personality Ryan Higa. Whoopi Goldberg has mentioned him several times on The View, saying that she loves his ideas.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nUnofficial aggregate of relevant links called \"YangLinks\"\nUnofficial Yang Gang News Feed\nUnofficial free images for yang supporters",

Trails connect the Court Avenue District, CBD, East Village, Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden, Iowa Events Center and Gray's Lake with other metro area recreational trails. A landscaped promenade along the street level connects the riverfront amphitheater and several plazas, including an outdoor ice skating rink and summertime fountain plaza.

          "If you want to go to a place where kids can spend their time doing hands on activities, this is a great choice. There is activity after activity to be involved in.",
          "Interesting place to take your kids. Lots of variety and they change up certain areas so it is not always the same.",
          "We visited with our 4 kids (ages 15 to 7) and everyone was engaged and having fun. We spent there around 3 hours and felt that we could come back and still have things to explore. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the exhibits were well designed and maintained. My wife",

          "The Science Center is a great place to spend the day with kids. It has fun things to do for both kids and adults. I really enjoy the Lego sculptures of the St. Louis Arch, the Pyramids, Golden Gate Bridge, Hoover Dam and others. The are many interactive things for the kids,",
          "The science center has something for everyone. They had a really neat mental health exhibit while we were there and a neat exhibit of famous buildings made out of legos. There are a ton of interactive activities! There is a parking ramp right across the street.",
          "Though it is a bit crowded when we went, it was a very fun and interactive experience to bring the grandkids! I was thoroughly impressed. I hope to bring the littlest when she is older. I even had fun playing with the weather channel monitor as an adult. Deliteful.",

          "Lots to see and do. So nice that the kids can keep doing the action exhibits in the room upstairs for what seems like hours giving a break from \u2018leashing\u2019 the kids while still being educational. Great for the whole family!",
          "Our 5 year old daughter had fun but the older children seemed a little bored. In general, the activities are attractive but they\u2019re nothing more than any other science museum offers. We were disappointed to find out that IMAX had been closed for two months and the giant model of",
          "This is a great place for adults and children to get hands on experience in science. The egg drop was great along with the making of a rocket out of paper and shooting it to see how far it would go. We attended most of the interactive shows and were not disappointed. We even",

          "We visited here on a frigid -23 F day and thought it would be overcrowded, but the center is so large that this was not a problem. Wide range of activities for all ages, and there were so many favorites that we will keep going back. Great job to all who developed this center!",
          "My children and grandchildren and I spent an afternoon here over the Christmas holiday. It was a very busy place which, to me, meant it was popular for families. Granted, it seemed to be directed mainly at children but the adults in our group loved watching the children play",

          "We visited on a very hot Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. There's many interactive exhibits geared towards kids, but as adults we had a great time as well. Highlights include building and launching paper rockets, don't break the egg drop, building a keystone arch,",
          "For what it cost it was pretty small. Other science centers we have visited have had a lot more activities. But our son had fun so that's all that matters",
          "I love a good science museum and have been to a number of them, but this is a real gem. Kids were everywhere doing hands-on things. Very educational, entertaining, and a safe environment. The I-Max has several shows from which to choose every hour. The restaurant had good",
          "The 2nd Friday of the month is family day with $5 admission to the museum or $5 admission to the Imax theater. I choose the movie and $5 is less than a matinee at a regular theater. Great deal!",
          "There are some really solid exhibits for kids, plenty of hands on activities. Even though this place is clearly geared towards kids, adults can find some enjoyment for special showings of movies in IMAX theater. Have to pay for parking which I think should be at least validated",

          "We used our ASTC reciprocal pass, and still had to pay for one child. There are some great exhibits in the museum, especially on the second floor where you can create your own air rocket (and launch it) as build cars out of legos and race them down a track. My son spent a good",
          "SC of I could do with little lowering of its prices otherwise this is a good place to spend a day with kids. The IMAX Dome is spectacular but the seating needs upgrade.",
          "I went here with my daughter and she really enjoyed it. We went during the week and there was not a lot of traffic. Some of the exhibits were needing some upkeep and repair, but overall a decent way to spend a few hours.",

          "Not much to do and most activities were broken and worn. Staff were slow and minimally tolerant of guests. So much empty space with nothing to see or do. I don't understand why anyone is paying to come here! On a positive note, there were lots of hand sanitizer stations, in",
          "Kids will love it. Very interactive and fun. Great demonstration. Parking is an issue and a bit difficult to get there. Food court is good but spendy. Storage lockers for coats etc. are only 50 cents.",
          "Great place. Most exhibits are for middle school or younger but today we were here from Arizona and they had 2 great IMAX movies. Dream Big and National parks adventure and my 16 year old and I loved.",
          "This was my family's first visit to the Science Center. The lack of parking was almost enough to keep us from entering. The admission I thought was high especially when you have to pay for parking. Hopefully the parking problem is a temporary issue bc of all the construction",
          "IMAX tickets are expensive now, but the experience is worth it. No other movie experience, including traditional IMAX theaters, are as immersive as what you'll have in this dome. Don't be fooled by Omniplexes - they aren't the same thing. Take advantage of sale days and SCI",
          "I think it goes without saying: don't go during Spring Break. However, I'm saying it. I went during Spring Break for some reason. The place is kind of a nightmare with the amount of kids. Also, with construction going on on condos and a new Hy-vee, parking took about 20+",
          "This is a very interesting and educational place to visit and good place to take your children for the education it has so many different exhibits",
          "Been going for years, but no more. Way over priced, over crowded, and lousy parking situation. Value here has diminished over the years, especially with their \"alacarte\" pricing on many things. They have some cool stuff on occasion, but mostly disappointing.",
          "Went with a friend and our children. Great fun for our toddlers! And, we had fun too! Lots to do and great fun learning! The cafeteria is nice too! Next time, I want to do the imax too.",
          "Just can't say enough about the wonderful opportunities for all ages to experience science in a positive educational environment!!!",
          "We've been members of the science center for a few years, and my daughter absolutely loves coming here. The planetarium was recently remodeled and offers a lot of great features throughout the day. They also have traveling exhibits that go through the science center, so things",
          "We had 3 grandkids with us for our visit here. What a fun place with many different experiences, all hands-on. The ages ranged from 5 to 12 and we all really enjoyed it. There were activities for all of us, including the adults.",
          "We have a relatively new building for our Science Center which is South of the center of downtown. There is a parking garage across the street. There are special exhibits and special programs advertised monthly. There is an Imax theater. I take my relatives there when they",
          "An amazing venue for children and adults alike! I know my level of anticipation equals the 5 grandkids 6-11 (I'm early 70's); have attended four years straight. We usually stay around two hours though could easily double that. Attending presentations are a highlight though",
          "Very nice place and lots of activities. After visiting with my teen, we realized she enjoyed it much more when she was younger. The new music area was enjoyable.",
          "My wife and I went to visit the museum as new arrivals to Des Moines. The museum has great interactive exhibits for younger children (3-12, in my estimation), but is lacking anything for adults. Once we get some grandchildren, we will bring them to see.",
          "We arrived at the Museum 15 minutes after they opened. The young man at the entrance was very polite and patient with us. Our children, ages 14, 10 and 5 enjoyed the exhibits and shows very much. Andrea did a wonderful job with her show about the digestive system and with",
          "I spent a full Saturday here with four grandchildren aged 3 to 9. We were not in a hurry, so we enjoyed every room and exhibit for as long as the kids wanted. It was very interactive and interesting for them. Just large enough to have plenty of variety. We broke up the day",
          "Great experience, the staff went above and beyond today, especially Renee and Laura! Wonderful place for kids of all ages!",
          "We were in Des Moines for only one day. Went to The National Park Adventure movie, narrated by Robert Redford, which was playing at the IMAX Theater. What a fabulous show. You will fall in love with the National Park system and be beguiled by Mother Nature. We did not visit",
          "I loved going here when I was a kid I love going their now. We have not been there since I was 11. I think they need more older kid activities to allow more aged families enjoy it to. The year I went s not on here so I picked the only one close enough. I'm 14 now to give you a",
          "There were all ages for children to delight in. I went with the 10 year old with the electrical things. The 1 and 3 year old had an area of their own. It is well worth it to see!!!",
          "We started with the IMAX Beautiful Planet show which was exciting and informative. Headed to the hands on tool area and then Legos. After to the activity area which included building Lego race cars with a 4 car racetrack, building a rocket and a dam to control the flow of water.",
          "Contacted SCI about a HUGE safety concern on 8/30. As of 3 weeks later, they haven't bothered to look into it nor reach back out to me at all. Parents with disabled children: they don't accommodate them. Parents with children who have allergies: they allow free grazing",
          "We had a free afternoon in Des Moines over the holiday weekend, and decided to take our 3 kids to the science center. I really wish we had more time to spend here, there was so much to do and our boys (ages 4, 10, 12) loved it. There were exhibits that were suited for our older",
          "It's a really educational place for (kids) lots of activities but I do not recommend this place just for adults or teens",
          "Adults and parents who wish to instill a growing and lifelong interest in science will take their own children and classrooms to the Science Center of Iowa throughout grade school and into middle school.",
          "For my visit I would give it 3 stars. It is not really the kind of place for adults without children. I did give it 4 stars because it is a great place to go if you take children of any age. There is so much to explore in space, energy, geology, most areas of science. For",
          "We have been family members of the Science Center for two years now and we visit at least monthly for about two to three hours, typically late in the afternoon to just run around and blow off steam. My boys always visit the same places and love them. We go to the \"grocery area\",",
          "Lots of hands on activities for all ages and good temporary exhibits that change every few months. My 9 year old could spend hours at the ball wall and in the town simulation. Also great Star theater where we can lay on the floor and watch shows about various topics. Lots for",
          "Been here a couple times with the kids. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. Plenty to keep kids going for a whole day.",
          "This is a great discovery place for children. I recommend going in the middle of the week. It is also nice for raining summer days.",
          "We spent about 2 hours in the Science Center and found plenty of activities geared for the young child. 3-10 but there is a center just for the toddler age child. Good hands on activities and learning centers. Nice place to visit on a really hot or rainy day.",
          "The Science Center offers so many interesting things to do for children/families. There are many inter-active features and learning opportunities that are most interesting and educational. The IMAX theater also offers a fun experience no matter what the movie playing at the",
          "This is a SMALL science center. If you've never visited before it will be fun for about two hours at most. We have season passes and stuff never changes. There is maybe one or two floating exhibits but they are fare and few between. We just went this past weekend and there",
          "We went here with our son and daughter-in-law and 18-month-old granddaughter and had a wonderful time! There was plenty for our toddler to do and see. This would be a great place to visit with children of all ages, but would probably appeal most to pre-teens. We loved the",
          "Being a grown man that loves IMAX I was not disappointed at all. We went to go see Born to be Wild and took our 6 year old daughter. It was great and actually kept her attention which is not easy to do. The facilities were very clean and the theater is awesome.",
          "This is not a very big science museum. It is ok for small children, but it does not have very much attractions, the ones thy do have are small.",
          "My boys are 4 & 6, they had a fabulous time at the Science Center of Iowa! They learned new things too. They have a few shows during the day, we saw the fire show.....it was very neat and educational!! The boys are still talking about when we go back they are going to build a",
          "Really enjoyed our time at the SCI. Various attractions and some added \"shows\" we could see. We went to one called \"Fireworks\" and learned about fire and combustion which our girls really enjoyed. Lots of hands on opportunities for the kids and adults alike. Visited the Dome",
          "This place more than rocked! From the globe IMAX to the green weather screen to the geometry room, it was great fun for hours! Highly recommend it. It was worth the money.",
          "SCI has many activities to entertain everyone for ages. There are live shows with a science theme, great IMax movies, and many hands-on activities that delight everyone who walks through the door. The ball wall, egg drop, and paper rockets are favorites of everyone. The only",
          "There are a lot of fascinating exhibits at the DSM Science Center. Many are hands on and the kids don't even realize they're doing engineering. Special exhibits can be great also.",
          "I'll admit that I have been here for a while. But I know family that has and this is a great place to go.",
          "So much more space and the Foucault pendulum is still there. I'm not sure when it moved to the new, much larger location, but so glad they moved. My 3 and 5 year olds had a blast in various parts. I will definitely go back!",
          "We visited on our way through Iowa using our reciprocal program. They charge you extra if you have more than 2 children! We have visited 20 museums with the program and not had this happen before! I paid it thinking this must be a very good museum and must be worth it! It was",
          "One of the greatest things that is the use and acknowledgment of the reciprocity program. There is an entire network all over the US where you can go and enjoy what these places have to offer for free or a discounted price. Des Moines Science Center did not disappoint by",
          "We drove from Texas to visit my dad over spring break. Turns out our spring break was a week earlier than Iowa, which made it the perfect time to visit the Science Center! We had such a lovely afternoon...with minimal crowds, the kids were able to do all of the hands-on",
          "SCI has many activities to entertain your family for 4 or more hours. There are live shows with a science theme, great IMax offerings, and many hands-on activities that delight kids of all ages. The ball wall, egg drop, and paper rockets were favorites of the 6 year-old that",
          "Clean & good food The Imax dome theatre is wonderful! Best way to watch a movie. Worth every pennies!",
          "Interactive exhibits for all ages make the Science Center of Iowa a great place to spend a chilly afternoon, especially if entertaining school age children.",
          "We \"only\" had 3 hours to spend here and that wasn't nearly long enough....especially for a first visit. This is a great space with a lot of room. I brought my teenager and my two younger sons and they all had stuff to keep them busy. The little kids got a lot more out of it",
          "There are so many interesting things to see and do one can't get bored even young children. The IMAX is a great experience also.",
          "Really fun place to take the family there is something for every age person! The theater is something worth going to! Go back every couple of months as it is always changing.",
          "I hoped the science center would be similar to the science museum in Chicago (geared toward everyone of all ages), but it wasn't. However, my husband and I had a nice time just walking around and playing with some of exhibits. The kids we encountered there seemed to have a good",
          "This particular Science center has one of the better IMAX theaters that I've been to. It also has a ton of seating but I would strongly recommend you get there early to find the seat you would prefer. As for the Science Center itself, I have always been impressed with the ever",
          "We were there for a wedding reception and it was very nice. It was great the young people and children could entertain themselves with all of the fun stuff at the center",
          "My husband had not seen Star Wars yet so we thought we would spend the extra money and go to IMAX. If you buy your tickets on line make sure to stop off at the desk and get your ticket/receipt as they have no way to give you a ticket when you go into the theater. We went early",
          "What a great place to see Star Wars the only problem was the stopped the film in the very beginning probably to let the rest of the people get seated.",
          "I saw Star Wars at the IMAX there. We sat in the front row. You could only see the characters necks and part of their chin from there. Being a 4 year Iraq war disabled vet who walks with a cane I would have liked to walk down the 4 steps to get out when the show was over.",
          "My kids are 8 and 7, both of them loved this place. The staff was friendly and it provided a great place to learn things about how things work.",
          "This is a nice Science Center/Children's Museum. I took my 5 yr old son there Friday night and the place was near empty. He talked me into taking him back on Saturday and it was packed because of a lego building contest going on. Still a very nice visit and large/open enough",
          "visted the Center for the 4th or 5th time and still find it to be a great time and good value. The Center brings in new exhibits on a regular basis and maintain their long running exhibits. I always see families enjoying themselves and packaged with other close attractions you",
          "Love love love this place, great place to take the kids for a day full of fun and learning. New stuff to do every time",
          "Our family found the Science Center of Iowa worth the trip. We've been to a large number of science museums and children's museums and this was certainly above average. Our kids really enjoyed the aerodynamics experience of building an air-powered rocket and seeing how far it",
          "We had a great time at the Science Center. The kids loved the demonstrations and hands on activities. There were exhibits for all interests, from space to atoms, from chemistry to genetics. This is a place we will surely visit again.",
          "The Science Center of Iowa is one of my favorite, if not the favorite, place to take my family. We make the drive from Fort Dodge at least twice a year. There is always something fun and engaging for all ages. No fuss over being bored. My husband, being the science lover that he",
          "The Science Center offers a lot of fun activities designed to encourage interest in science, and kids love it. I'm not going to talk about any of that. IMAX all the way. The center houses an exceptional IMAX theater that plays a lot of informative documentaries, but also plays",
          "The Science Center is somewhere I used to go all the time as a kid. Lately though, I have been attending their mixology nights, and even a few times as a field trip with my preschool class. They have really stepped up their game as of late, and have been offering programs that",
          "Fun for all ages. The interesting solar system display. Many activities - rockets, race cars and dominoes were th he favorite.",
          "This was great for our pre-school kids, and I would imagine elementary school students would be amused as well. We went on a Thursday morning in the summer and had the place to ourselves.",
          "So we went when they had the dinosaur displays. They don't always have them. My boys had a pretty good time there but it would not be worth the huge price to get in without the dinosaurs for sure. I would never recommend going there unless you are seeing a special limited time",
          "Good for little kids. We made the mistake of thinking it was larger than it was. Admission was 20 dollars for two people with a coupon off the travel Des Moines site. We took note this is an extremely interactive place for children and could keep them entertained for hours.",
          "The kids love the hands on activities, the star theater and play area. We have had memberships that are great for going for a few hours especially on a raining day.",
          "There are only a few rooms of activities at the Science Center. And there is a lot of open space in the middle of it all. The kids think it's fun but we only go once a year. We visit other cities and go to their Science Centers and wonder why ours is so lame.",
          "Very nice place to spend the day with grandkids they have decent prices only thing that I wasn't please about was street parking otherwise fun place great staff",
          "We bought a membership again this year for the Science Center and need to use it more. Stopped in to watch the original Jurassic Park in the IMAX theater and kids really enjoyed the experience. Pretty neat and scary on the big screen! Spent an hour beforehand letting the kids",
          "Been there many times with the grandkids and they always enjoy it. We went in July and I actually though they would be to big (ages 11 and 13) and they enjoyed it just as much as they did when they were younger.",
          "Not a lot of street parking near by. Prices are pretty good. The kids had a great time and we stayed several hours. The demonstrations and iMax are also worth seeing.",
          "My wife and I cam specifically to see the planetarium show. On arrival we were told the facility was broken and there was no repair date. I asked to see the director and was told the director doesn't work weekends (when most of the visitors show up and parents bring their",
          "Hours of unique fun for kids of all ages. The Imax was fun I loved the dome room. This place is a must see for parents looking to entertain children.",
          "My two (almost three) year old could have stayed here all day I'm pretty sure. They have a fantastic offering of activities for anyone from probably age 2-8. Up to age 12 would probably have fun for an hour or so...anything beyond that, it's probably hit and miss (depending on",
          "There were 2 levels of exploring, live educational talks/demonstrations. A build it/test it/STEM area for 'scientific play' that my kids loved. There was a nature area which displayed live snakes and frogs. There were some stuffed birds and animals. It is very similar to the",
          "Getting in the door was a hassle. Showed pass ID . Girls were not very friendly. Kids said it was ok nothing special. Probably wouldn't go back.",
          "This should be top 3 in your itinerary!! I went with a 3 year old, 4 year old, husband, and senor citizens and I believe that ALL of them found it enjoyable. This is a suitable location to visit for a few hours (4-5) the kids especially loved the rocket launcher.",
          "My nephew (7) loves coming here when he is in town. Lots of hands on for an energetic mischief maker. Unfortunately the exhibits do not change & there aren't as many as one might expect based on the size of the building. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to walk through the last time",
          "We went for the IMAX (saw the Lemur film), but stayed for lunch and some exploration. The film was great, with a fun and informative short on how the IMAX screen & surround sound works showing before the feature. The cafeteria was expensive, as cafeterias are; but the pizza was",
          "My husband and I drove 2 hours to check this place out and spend some time in Des Moines and boy was I disappointed. We went without kids and there wasn't much to see. Even if I had kids, I don't think we would have spent that much longer there. The place is pretty big, but",
          "Not worth visiting, unless you have small children. Everything is broken! There are no attractions that amuses the adult or older teens. Everything is for small children. They need to learn from the pro science centers like Phoenix. Place should be renamed as Des Moines Small",
          "We were here from 9:30-4:00. The planetarium was closed which was disappointing, but it was advertised as closed so we knew in advance. Lots of hands on things, even for a teenager. One issue: the 'programs' changed locations from what the daily program stated and we missed the",
          "We took the kids to the Science center, they had alot for them to do and it was a blast. It was right in the center of downtown des moines the city is alot nicer from the last time I was here. Would def come again if the family comes again!",
          "We paid 20 dollars for my son and I to get in the science section only. We did not watch any movies. It took about 1.5 hours to complete the whole thing. My 6-year-old son was interested in the bubbles and playing with the fake fruits. I don't understand the reasons for all",
          "It's good but pretty quickly can be gone through. If it had the same approach like the science center in Omaha it would be better. It's a one and done type place.",
          "really full of very interesting science items laid out so you can understand how they work in laymans terms. this is well worth the visit as there is so much to see. you will like this venue as they took a lot of time and effort to put on a good program. Anyone will have a good",
          "I have children from 16 to 6. The youngest one still enjoys the Science Center, but the rest don't even want to go. We usually are completely done in 1.5 hours so the admission fee feels pretty steep. IMax was extra and the movie was ok. Gift shop is fun, you do not need to",
          "Was great for our kids (ages 10 & 6) and they enjoyed the IMAXX theater. Not over priced but not cheap either once you get through the gift shop on the way out.",
          "Two of us went - adults - and found out quickly that it's geared towards kids. We still had a good time, but it was a little boring for adults. Lesson learned :)",
          "They have an IMAX theater which is great. A decent gift shop. Regular exhibits as well as traveling exhibits. One of their most memorable traveling exhibits was Sue, the T-Rex. Great for the family.",
          "This was a great science center with lots of interactive activities for kids of all ages. They also have an IMAX theater (additional cost). We opted to do the space exploration movie. It was very educational. There is something for everyone here - dinosaurs, weather related,",
          "Great place to explore silence. Lots of hands on exhibits. More to do than you might think. We took 10 people and the cost was still very reasonable.",
          "This is a great place to take your kids on a rainy afternoon. Great exhibits! My kids had a blast and didn't want to leave!",
          "I was impressed by the interactive space-related activities available for kids. Astronaut suits, a replica of the rover...The IMAX theatre is expensive but worth visiting at least once. Highly recommended.",
          "This is definitely a place to take the kids. Lots of opportunities to experience scientific principles in a fun atmosphere.",
          "The center has a number of great displays. You might see anything from a complete display of the human body exposing all of the veins, blood vessels, ligaments muscle groups in detail to science displays and even a huge cinema surround dome theater. A great place for children",
          "Nice place to visit but I thought Iowa City children's museum was more engaging. Most fun I had was with the spinning table in which you try to spin an objects on the table while the table also spins.",
          "This focuses on science of interest to kids... lots of interactive stations, dinosaurs, and space exploration exhibits. We were disappointed th ific is designed primarily for families at the planetarium was closed during our visit. The IMAX theater has educational films of",
          "We took our grandchildren, 27 months and almost 5, to the Science Center on a recent Saturday. A dinosaur traveling exhibit is there now, and it was an attention-getter for our five-year-old grandson. Then we explored, and there's lots to see. Special care has been invested in",
          "Our family has been to many different science museums in other cities and this one is very good. The exhibits are spaced nicely so that they are not over crowded. The dinosaur exhibit was quite interesting and informative but still brief to keep the children's attention. The",
          "What a great way to spend a day. There are lots of fun exhibits that are mainstays with one large exhibit that is featured and changes. They also have an Imax theater. it's one of the smaller ones but still an Imax movie is like nothing else you'll see. There is parking on the",
          "The movie was great on the dome, because it was a space movie. I didn't get to see the museum, but it looked great for kids and they do things for adults too.",
          "We like the science center anyway, but the new dinosaur exhibit is great. It is engaging for the kids and for adults. I would encourage anyone to visit and check it out and of course there are all the other excellent exhibits to take a look at as well.",
          "I wouldn't call it a 'must see' if you're visiting Des Moines, but it's definitely a quality family attraction. Personally, after having been there a few times, I'm more likely to go when there is a special exhibit. The permanent exhibits are best for younger children, and there",
          "Each of our 3 grandsons spends 1 wk with us and a visit to the Science Ctr is a request we get by all 3 every year. Parking ramp nearby for easy access. Wish some exhibits would be updated and/or changed out more often.",
          "We had attended the Science Center through the years, but it didn't hold our kids attention long enough. We thought it was too expensive for a family activity for the regular exhibits. They just held their first Mini Maker Faire, we used a GroupOn coupon, so it was 1/2 off",
          "Saw a lot of original ideas. A lot of hands on stuff for kids. It was a little crowded. There was an awesome laser light show and Lego activities.",
          "We all learned something and had a great time. It is very informative and an amazing time for kids and parents to have together.",
          "We had a good afternoon here, even kept the teenagers interest. The IMAX movie was my first and very cool. I would have thought that they would have more exhibits because they did not lack space. And the parking situation could be improved.",
          "As our children are getting older (ages 8 & 9) we have started relying more on Science Centers and less on Children's Museums as a form of hands on fun and education. This facility was large and many exhibits looked brand new so we were initially excited when we walked in. But",
          "We enjoyed our time doing \"science-y\" things and learning more about the experiments, interactive stations and watching the movie one the big screen. There is something there to entertain almost everyone.",
          "This is by far one of the best science centers I have been to. I would recommend you have at least 3 hours. The cost is $11.00 for adults and children 2 to 12 and under are $7.00. You have to pay for parking and it runs $3.00 for the first hour and then $1.00 each additional",
          "This was the last stop on our weeklong vacation. It surpassed my expectations. The interactive exhibits were fun and interesting to the kids. They were learning and having fun at the same time. It was not crowded so they could take their time and tweak their projects and try",
          "We went here as we were visiting for a week while my husband worked in Des Moines. We came on a Monday because I saw on their website that they have story time at 10:30am. The story time was fun, as the gal read a few books on the screen & all around the rest of the",
          "Exhibits and activities get changed several times a year. I like that SCI meets the educational needs of toddlers. The small discoveries space is great and not very busy during the week.",
          "It's not often you find something that is truly interesting and enjoyable for the entire span of age groups, but the Science Center of Iowa surprised us. Even my 11 yr old said \"I thought it was going to be boring--reading lots of cards about stuff but it was really fun!\" Many",
          "We were looking for something to do while my husband had meetings (we came in from out if town). We arrived right as they opened, and really enjoyed very low crowds for the first hour. After that, the place filled up very quickly with a couple of school groups and several",
          "Great place for a wedding reception, roomy and open, parking is convenient. Patio available for music and dancing.",
          "we took my 19 month old daughter with us thinking if nothing else she might like the stars when we got there we found that there is a great area for kids under 5 though there isnt really any folks on staff to explain the science behind it so I kinda felt like a teacher than a",
          "They have Blank cinema, facilities, souvenir shop, and exhibits that kids, family will certainly enjoy.",
          "The Science Center was fun. My daughter loved that you could forecast the weather here and have fun with a green screen. They also had an awesome Space exhibit and theater. Where we spent the most time is the room with all the stations where you could create a car with legos",
          "Our family spends at least 1-2 weekends a month there and they love it. It's perfect-sized for a few hours on a weekend, and the shows are fun.",
          "So much to do and see, even for a 3 year old. We enjoyed learning about \"One World, One Sky\" with Sesame Street characters in the Star Theatre during our visit. Small Discoveries is always our first stop. This is a wonderful place to spend several hours on a rainy day!",
          "This is for elementary school children. They don't tell you that. They just take your $11 and hand you a map. There is little to interest adults. I see no reason for an adult to visit unless it is with family or as a chaperone for school events. There is nothing of museum",
          "Looking for fun and education? Or even just something to do that doesn't require a parka and snow boots in the winter? This is a great attraction.",
          "We have taken our grandkids and have gone on our own, and both experiences have been wonderful. The exhibits and activities are varied enough to tickle the imagination and broaden the mind of any age group.",
          "While visiting friends, our two families spent an entire afternoon at the science center. The kids were aged 4, 5, 6, and 8. The highlights for our group was the \"make your own rocket\", the snakes/weather broadcasting, and the imax movie. The facility was very clean, laid out",
          "The grandchildren AND Grandparents were thrilled! The dinosaurs were huge. There was an excavation area and the children learned to brush and excavate a site appropriately.",
          "I brought my six year old here for half a day and she had a blast. There are a number of exhibits all of which are appropriate for younger children. There were also a few presentations (toys in space was one) that held the interest of my daughter. I don't think there would be",
          "We were there when the Da Vinci exhibit was on display, and a fine one it was. We enjoyed all of it! There are some interesting interactive things to do also. We were there on off hours, when kids were in school. It was not too croweded when we first got there, but before we",
          "My son is 5 and loves the Science Center. I think he would go every week if we could. I'm not sure how older kids would like it, but for preschool and elementary aged it's great. They also have excellent travelling exhibits, like the T-Rex.",
          "Nothing to brag about, your average science center. But as a ASCT memeber I get to go into free so why not!",
          "I would recommend taking children to the Science Center, there is so much to see and do, they really liked it. There is a lot of hands on craft things, it was a lot different than I had expected, the kids love it. Yes, go see it for yourself, nice on a rainy day. Carolyn H",
          "We have 3 kids (5, 8 & 10) and we managed to see and do it all in less than 2 hours and we were all a little bored. We live in MPLS so we have a large Science Museum here so hard to compare to that. Just glad that we went on the Family Friday night while we were in town so it",
          "This was our first visit and we loved it! They have areas for kids of all ages (including a special toddler room) with tons of hands on activities. Also their free shows are a MUST SEE! Iowa Skies and Deep Freeze were really cool.",
          "This was our second visit, we purchased a membership the first time knowing we would be back in town visiting family throughout the year. I like that they rotate in new displays on the bottom floor. I am afraid that the kids will get bored with the upstairs areas after a couple",
          "Our kids (ages 4,6,8) had a great time at the Science Center. We stayed about three hours and the kids were interested the whole time. The museum is interactive with lots of different experiments and ideas. I like that several of the exhibits could be manipulated by all three",
          "This is a great place to spend a day with the kids or grandkids. There are many hands on displays for the children to do and learn from. Also many displays to read and learn from. Not only is this place entertaining but very educational. Adults will also find this place",
          "Great lectures made fun ! kids loved+want to go back again,I'm sure we will! Probably a better fit for kids a little older,there seemed to be a lot of babies getting in the way. If your kids can't say+ spell Science,they are too young. Take them when they are older+ can get",
          "We spent the day from open to close here. A t-rex named sue exhibit was there along with the iowa state science team. My kids learned about dinosaurs, nano science, they did a ton of experiments. They enjoyed the acting out being a weatherman with the green screen. They got",
          "So fascinating! Educational! Fun things to do! A lot of hands on learning for the kids and everyone else. Loved the IMAX movie! Wish I could go more often.",
          "We went here and I guess we were expecting alot more then it was? I think kids would enjoy it alot more then we did.. the best part of the whole center is the sky dome. other then that it's completely forgetable. boring and has about 4 rooms.",
          "Would be good for 3-7 year old. Not much for older 10+ kids to do. Loud and not very well kept up. Carpets could use a good cleaning, and bathrooms not well stocked.",
          "It is very pricey for the little bit it is. It really does not have that musch at it. The exhibits and Imax theater cost extra.Not suitable for children under 4",
          "The science center offers fun activities for the kids. We have a membership and have gone frequently so I can say that as an adult I am worn out with it. But they get a new themed exhibit a couple times a year that we go check out. They have food which is actually pretty",
          "Location is easily found and parking most times is easily available. With kids, the entrance time can seem very long. It will be difficult to get close up to exhibits during busy times. Encourage them, however, to work hands-on as the exhibits will be more meaningful. It's",
          "Over-priced - not sure how the average Iowa family with kids could afford it - too crowded with children, definitely NOT for adults who love science looking to learn more. I miss the old Science Center; it was less Disneyfied.",
          "We spent a Saturday afternoon here with out 7-year-old daughter who is very interested in science. We had a lovely time as a family! We saw the T-rex exhibit (it is a traveling exhibit, not permanent). Upstairs was by far the best part of our visit. The star room where they",
          "Our extended family visited the museum on Easter Saturday, a very busy day. The museum is perfect for children of many ages. The staff were attentive, and despite a large number of attendees, one did not feel crowded or pressured. The ZAP show involved the children and was",
          "We spent two lovely days at the science center with a 3 year old and a 5 year old. The 5 year old really enjoyed the presentations on the great hall. The speakers are very engaging and describe the concepts simply, but use correct terms like sublimation. The Sue dinosaur exhibit",

          "I took my 2-year old niece and 6-year old nephew to the SCI and we enjoyed the time. There are enough hands on activities to keep the kids engaged. They have a spot for kinders which is nice as the activity center upstairs is for 6+ year old kids. We went to the IMAX and saw the",
          "We had a great time. Sue the T-Rex was on display, and my 6 year old HAD to see \"her\". The star lab was amazing, and their learning center upstairs would have kept the kids entertained for hours on end. Big enough to have lots of fun things for the kids, but not so big that the",
          "Having visited a Science Center in a neighboring state, I was pretty disappointed by my home state's center. The exhibits are good, if starting to look a little worse for wear, but staff is scarce. This would be a good half-day visit with kids 4-10 who are interested in",

          "The SCI (Science Center of Iowa) is a small science museum located in downown Des Moines. The core exhibits are pretty basic. An IMAX theatre is one of the big attractions. SCI features travelling exhibits which are sometimes quite good. Summer camps for children are well",
          "Great for all ages. Could spend all day going through the different areas. Always a new exhibit for the adults to enjoy.",
          "I really enjoy science, and used to have extraordinary respect for The Science Cent4er of Iowa until they hosted Gunther von Hagen's plastination exhibit. I thought, from the TV advertisements, that my husband and I were going to see completely plastic works of art to look like",
          "We are members of four years and I am still surprised how much my children, now 6 and 8, love coming here. It is pretty kid-centered except for the special visiting exhibits and IMAX movies, but those cost extra.",
          "Great place to take the kids. Fun and educational. Get there early for the best seats in the theater. No 3D, but huge screen and sound.",
          "The first floor is for toddlers and per-schoolers. Upstairs was okay. It was clean, but not that interesting. The exhibits weren't geared toward older kids as mine, ages 10, 11, and 14 didn't learn much new. A couple exhibits were fun for them, like the egg drop and building the",
          "We have been to several Science Centers. This looked like a good place for young children, but there is very little for older children. I think it is even limited for any child over 8 years old. There were a few very nice exhibits, but unless you use a map, it is hard to get",
          "We had a great time there. My only (minor) complaint was that we ran out of things to do pretty quickly. More a place to spend an hour to an hour and a half than an afternoon.",
          "this is a great place to bring kids for hands on learning for all ages.",
          "Attended with a first grade class and the kids loved being there and all the attractions. My favorite was the IMAX star show.",
          "Big and new but not a lot to see. Not worth the cost of admission.",
          "The building was so big, and yet there was so much space in there. They could easily add more attractions and information.",
          "I took my 2 boys down the Science Center of Iowa. I had pre-planned and checked out the website in advance and noticed they had a new Mars exhibit coming. Being the space buffs we are, thought it would be great to get a membership and enjoy a discount. So we trotted on down late",
          "We love visiting the science center. They have really cool interactive topics and learning centers. The Kids love it and I do too. we always go back for more.",
          "The science center is small (we saw all of the exhibits in a couple of hours) but the exhibits are well put together and interesting. The planetarium is by far the most exciting exhibit. Visitors can choose their own star show sequences on a computer and then go inside the",
          "this is a nice science center. has a great area for the kiddos and some great exhibits.",
          "So many things for kids to do you almost don't know where to start. Brings science down to a level where kids can understand and find fun in learning. Also make sure you catch the IMAX theater ... great movies! This is a must stop place for any trip to Des Moines!",
          "Yes, this place was designed for kids and families. The exhibits and the interactive areas could keep kids occupied and involved for hours. But individuals can also experience science and technology here. Plus there is an IMAX Theater here--truly an unique movie experience. I",
          "The Science Center should do a better job of maintaining their kid friendly exhibits.",
          "I've been here a few times for the IMAX theatre and it just blows my mind with the size of the screen and sound quality. The only exibit I've seen here is the Titanic exibit, which was impressive with the artifacts and simulated iceberg. Theres a cafeteria with some food, not",
          "DaVinci and Egyptian Mummies are only 2 of the recent special exhibits brought to the Science Center! Get a year pass for Science Center, Living History Farms and Blank Park Zoo and you and the kids (or Grand Kids!) will learn and have fun the whole year!",
          "Great place for kids to go and learn and see things. Would be great for field trip or take you kids on a weekend or rainy day. Adults would find it interesting also.",
          "Kids will also love the exhibits. Parking available nearby, and Court Street offers nice restaurant options and a good farmers market on summer weekends. Good family outing.",
          "I love that they have an IMAX there, and shows to go along with whatever their feature exhibit is. They have had some really excellent exhibits: Michaelangelo, The Body Human, to mention but a few.",
          "I'll try and keep this short. I think the Science center had the possibility to be really great but those that planned and selected the main exhibits (not the traveling ones) did a poor job. The place is style over substance. Most exhibits have a preschool feel to them and most",
          "My 8 year old daughter and I visited the Science Center for Bodies in Motion. It was FABULOUS! My daughter was intrigued the entire length of our stay! We have visited the IMAX theatre and other exhibits in the past, and have ALWAYS had a wonderful time!",
          "Science Center of Iowa is very educational and a great place to take children for the day. Lots to see!!",
          "Even as an adult, I enjoyed touring the Science Center. The changing events keep people returning. The food isn't too expensive. Great place for kids over 4 years old.",
          "Great theater and exhibits but filthy dirty the time we went. :(",
          "We went to the science center with out 6 and 9 year olds. The Egypt exhibt was going when we were there. My 6 year old was fascinated by the mummy! The food is beyond wonderful in the little food court area and the staff was exceptional. The center itself was mediocre, no",
          "We recently saw the exhibition of Leonardo Da Vinci's inventions. Very thoughtprovoking! Currently there is an exhibit on Ancient Egypt.",
          "If you have younger kids, 3-9 year olds, this pass to the zoo and Science Center is totally worth it. We go about once a month, the kids like the exhibits which typically change about every quarter. They also have a huge IMAX screen.",
          "We stayed with the main exhibits which was a rather small selection due to the large area taken by the special exhibits. There are still a good number of interactive areas. I think that me and my wife had just as much fun as our 2yr old. But there we no descriptions of what",
          "Nice place to spend the day with the family. We've gone to the Da Vinci and Body Vital exhibits. Nice way to spend a day, just wish it was more affordable for the middle-class family. I would go on a weekend. SOme of their year-round areas are getting a bit worn down and could",
          "Body Works was great! Nothing like the nervous system to get you thinking! The rest of the place is neat, but nothing huge to comment on. A bit expensive for what it was, but worth it ;)",
          "My wife and I have enjoyed many other science centers we've visited. But, if you don't have kids with you, do not visit this place. First, you have to pay to park your car which isn't mentioned until you get there. And it is pay by the hour, so it feels like they don't even want",
          "We had a great time. The adults and kids all enjoyed our time there. Everything was hands on and informative. We spent the whole day and never ran out of things to do (just ran out of money to do it).",
          "My husband and I went to the Science Center today. I literally thought it was a joke! It has 3 different rooms upstairs. 1 with snakes, 1 centered around stars (also has a little theater) and the other is a kids play room basically which was kinda neat. 1 room downstairs (which"

        "wiki": "Iowa ( (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern United States, bordered by the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west. It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north.\nIn colonial times, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt.In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy made the transition to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology, and green energy production. Iowa is the 26th most extensive in land area and the 30th most populous of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital, most populous city, and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa. Iowa has been listed as one of the safest U.S. states to live in.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIowa derives its name from the Ioway people, one of the many Native American tribes that occupied the state at the time of European colonization.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Boundaries ===\n\nIowa is bordered by the Mississippi River on the east and the Missouri River and the Big Sioux River on the west. The northern boundary is a line along 43 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude. The southern border is the Des Moines River and a not-quite-straight line along approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in Missouri v. Iowa (1849) after a standoff between Missouri and Iowa known as the Honey War.Iowa is the only state whose east and west borders are formed entirely by rivers.Iowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. The state capital, Des Moines, is in Polk County.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nIowa's bedrock geology generally increases in age from west to east. In northwest Iowa, Cretaceous bedrock can be 74 million years old; in eastern Iowa Cambrian bedrock dates to c. 500 million years ago.Iowa is generally not flat; most of the state consists of rolling hills. Iowa can be divided into eight landforms based on glaciation, soils, topography, and river drainage. Loess hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are several hundred feet thick. Northeast Iowa along the Upper Mississippi River is part of the Driftless Area, consisting of steep hills and valleys which appear almost mountainous.Several natural lakes exist, most notably Spirit Lake, West Okoboji Lake, and East Okoboji Lake in northwest Iowa (see Iowa Great Lakes). To the east lies Clear Lake. Man-made lakes include Lake Odessa, Saylorville Lake, Lake Red Rock, Coralville Lake, Lake MacBride, and Rathbun Lake. Before European settlement, 4 to 6 million acres of the state was covered with wetlands, about 95% of these wetlands have been drained.\n\n\n=== Ecology and environment ===\n\nIowa's natural vegetation is tallgrass prairie and savanna in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas. Most of Iowa is used for agriculture; crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.The southern part of Iowa is categorized as the Central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion. The Northern, drier part of Iowa is categorized as part of the Central tall grasslands.There is a dearth of natural areas in Iowa; less than 1% of the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of Iowa remains intact; only about 5% of the state's prairie pothole wetlands remain, and most of the original forest has been lost. As of 2005 Iowa ranked 49th of U.S. states in public land holdings. Threatened or endangered animals in Iowa include the interior least tern, piping plover, Indiana bat, pallid sturgeon, the Iowa Pleistocene land snail, Higgins' eye pearly mussel, and the Topeka shiner. Endangered or threatened plants include western prairie fringed orchid, eastern prairie fringed orchid, Mead's milkweed, prairie bush clover, and northern wild monkshood.There is little proof to suggest that the explosion in the number of high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural water contamination and a decline in air quality. In fact, covered manure storage in modern barns prevent that manure from washing away into surface water, as it does in open lots as snow melts and thunderstorms occur.\nOther factors negatively affecting Iowa's environment include the extensive use of older coal-fired power plants, fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production, and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nIowa has a humid continental climate throughout the state (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) with extremes of both heat and cold. The average annual temperature at Des Moines is 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C); for some locations in the north, such as Mason City, the figure is about 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C), while Keokuk, on the Mississippi River, averages 52 \u00b0F (11 \u00b0C). Snowfall is common, with Des Moines getting about 26 days of snowfall a year, and other places, such as Shenandoah getting about 11 days of snowfall in a year.Spring ushers in the beginning of the severe weather season. Iowa averages about 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year. The 30-year annual average Tornadoes in Iowa is 47. In 2008, twelve people were killed by tornadoes in Iowa, making it the deadliest year since 1968 and also the second most tornadoes in a year with 105, matching the total from 2001.Iowa summers are known for heat and humidity, with daytime temperatures sometimes near 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) and occasionally exceeding 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Average winters in the state have been known to drop well below freezing, even dropping below \u221218 \u00b0F (\u221228 \u00b0C). Iowa's all-time hottest temperature of 118 \u00b0F (48 \u00b0C) was recorded at Keokuk on July 20, 1934, during a nationwide heat wave; the all-time lowest temperature of \u221247 \u00b0F (\u221244 \u00b0C) was recorded at Washta on January 12, 1912.\nIowa has a relatively smooth gradient of varying precipitation across the state, with areas in the southeast of the state receiving an average of over 38 inches (97 cm) of rain annually, and the northwest of the state receiving less than 28 inches (71 cm). The pattern of precipitation across Iowa is seasonal, with more rain falling in the summer months. Virtually statewide, the driest month is January or February, and the wettest month is June, owing to frequent showers and thunderstorms, some of which produce hail, damaging winds and/or tornadoes. In Des Moines, roughly in the center of the state, over two-thirds of the 34.72 inches (88.2 cm) of rain falls from April through September, and about half the average annual precipitation falls from May through August, peaking in June.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\nWhen American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric Oneota include the Dakota, Ho-Chunk, Ioway, and Otoe. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the Illiniwek, Meskwaki, Omaha, and Sauk.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early colonization, exploitation and trade, 1673\u20131808 ===\n\nThe first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indigenous villages on the Iowa side. The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763. The French, before their impending defeat in the French and Indian War, transferred ownership to their ally, Spain. Spain practiced very loose control over the Iowa region, granting trading licenses to French and British traders, who established trading posts along the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers.Iowa was part of a territory known as La Louisiane or Louisiana, and European traders were interested in lead and furs obtained by Indigenous people. The Sauk and Meskwaki effectively controlled trade on the Mississippi in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Among the early traders on the Mississippi were Julien Dubuque, Robert La Salle, and Paul Marin. Along the Missouri River at least five French and English trading houses were built before 1808. In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte took control of Louisiana from Spain in a treaty.After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two parts\u2014the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter. The Indiana Territory was created in 1800 to exercise jurisdiction over this portion of the District; William Henry Harrison was its first governor. Much of Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805, but it was not until the construction of Fort Madison in 1808 that the U.S. established tenuous military control over the region.\n\n\n=== War of 1812 and unstable U.S. control ===\n\nFort Madison was built to control trade and establish U.S. dominance over the Upper Mississippi, but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Ho-Chunk, many of whom allied with the British, who had not abandoned claims to the territory. Fort Madison was defeated by British-supported Indigenous people in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, also fell to the British. Black Hawk took part in the siege of Fort Madison. Another small military outpost was established along the Mississippi River in present-day Bellevue. This poorly situated stockade was similarly attacked by hundreds of Indigenous people in 1813, but was successfully defended and later abandoned until settlers returned to the area in the mid-1830s.After the war, the U.S. re-established control of the region through the construction of Fort Armstrong, Fort Snelling in Minnesota, and Fort Atkinson in Nebraska.\n\n\n=== Indian removal, 1814\u20131832 ===\n\nThe U.S. encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west. A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison that surrendered much of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War.The Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley during 1832 in the Black Hawk Purchase and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of them moving to a reservation in Kansas. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the Meskwaki Settlement remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land. The Ho-Chunk were removed from Iowa in 1848, and the Dakota were removed by 1858. Western Iowa around modern Council Bluffs was used as an Indian Reservation for members of the Council of Three Fires.\n\n\n=== U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860 ===\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833. Primarily, they were families from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia who settled along the western banks of the Mississippi River, founding the modern day cities of Dubuque and Bellevue. On July 4, 1838, the U.S. Congress established the Territory of Iowa. President Martin Van Buren appointed Robert Lucas governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242.Almost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at Fairfield. The first fair was held October 25\u201327, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the Spanish\u2013American War and the World's Fair being held in nearby Omaha, Nebraska. The fair was also a World War II wartime casualty from 1942 to 1945, as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot.\n\n\n=== Civil War, 1861\u20131865 ===\n\nIowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln, though there was an antiwar \"Copperhead\" movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war. There were no battles in the state, although the battle of Athens, Missouri, 1861, was fought just across the Des Moines River from Croton, Iowa, and shots from the battle landed in Iowa. Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities.Much of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to Samuel J. Kirkwood, its first wartime governor. Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty. Iowa contributed proportionately more men to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates surrendered at Appomattox.Most fought in the great campaigns in the Mississippi Valley and in the South. Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri, Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg, Iuka, and Corinth. They served with the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and fought under Union General Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley. Many died and were buried at Andersonville. They marched on General Nathaniel Banks' ill-starred expedition to the Red River. Twenty-seven Iowans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, which was first awarded in the Civil War.Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals\u2014Grenville Mellen Dodge, Samuel R. Curtis, Francis J. Herron, and Frederick Steele\u2014and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.\n\n\n=== Agricultural expansion, 1865\u20131930 ===\n\nFollowing the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860 to 1,624,615 in 1880. The American Civil War briefly brought higher profits.In 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first industries developed in the 1830s, which were mainly for processing materials grown in the area, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n\n=== Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985 ===\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The period after World War II witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations.The farm crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression. The crisis spurred a major, decade-long population decline.\n\n\n=== Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985\u2013present ===\nAfter bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture. By the early 21st century, it was characterized by a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services. The population of Iowa has increased at a faster rate than the U.S. as a whole, and Iowa now has a predominantly urban population. The Iowa Economic Development Authority, created in 2011 has replaced the Iowa Department of Economic Development and its annual reports are a source of economic information.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Iowa was 3,155,070 on July 1, 2019, a 3.57% increase since the 2010 Census.Of the residents of Iowa, 70.8% were born in Iowa, 23.6% were born in a different U.S. state, 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5% were foreign born.Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 29,386 people, while migration within the country produced a net loss of 41,140 people. 6.5% of Iowa's population were reported as under the age of five, 22.6% under 18, and 14.7% were 65 or older. Males made up approximately 49.6% of the population. Iowa has banned sanctuary cities. The population density of the state is 52.7 people per square mile. As of the 2010 Census, the center of population of Iowa is in Marshall County, near Melbourne.As of the 2010 Census, the population of Iowa was 3,046,355. The gender makeup of the state was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. 23.9% of the population were under the age of 18; 61.2% were between the ages of 18 and 64; and 14.9% were 65 years of age or older.The table below shows the racial composition of Iowa's population as of 2018.\n\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 5.6% of Iowa's population were of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race): Mexican (4.3%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.1%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (1.0%). The five largest ancestry groups were: German (35.1%), Irish (13.5%), English (8.2%), American (5.8%), and Norwegian (5.0%).\n\n\n=== Settlement ===\n\nIowa's population is more urban than rural, with 61 percent living in urban areas in 2000, a trend that began in the early 20th century. Urban counties in Iowa grew 8.5% from 2000 to 2008, while rural counties declined by 4.2%. The shift from rural to urban has caused population increases in more urbanized counties such as Dallas, Johnson, Linn, Polk, and Scott, at the expense of more rural counties.Iowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota), is feeling the brunt of rural flight, although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990. Some smaller communities, such as Denison and Storm Lake, have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers.Another demographic problem for Iowa is the brain drain, in which educated young adults leave the state in search of better prospects in higher education or employment. During the 1990s, Iowa had the second highest exodus rate for single, educated young adults, second only to North Dakota.\n\n\n=== Birth data ===\n\nNote: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\n\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nA 2001 survey from the City University of New York found 52% of Iowans are Protestant, while 23% are Catholic, and other religions made up 6%. 13% responded with non-religious, and 5% did not answer. A survey from the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) in 2010 found that the largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 235,190 adherents and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 229,557. The largest non-Protestant religion was Catholicism with 503,080 adherents. The state has a great number of Reformed denominations. The Presbyterian Church (USA) had almost 290 congregations and 51,380 members followed by the Reformed Church in America with 80 churches and 40,000 members, and the United Church of Christ had 180 churches and 39,000 members.The study Religious Congregations & Membership: 2000 found in the southernmost two tiers of Iowa counties and in other counties in the center of the state, the largest religious group was the United Methodist Church; in the northeast part of the state, including Dubuque and Linn counties (where Cedar Rapids is located), the Catholic Church was the largest; and in ten counties, including three in the northern tier, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was the largest.

Natives of northern Iowa\u2014including Sioux City, Fort Dodge, and the Waterloo region\u2014tend to speak the dialect linguists call North Central American English, which is also found in North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Natives of central and southern Iowa\u2014including such cities as Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, and Iowa City\u2014tend to speak the North Midland dialect also found in eastern Nebraska, central Illinois, and central Indiana.

This economic diversity has helped Iowa weather the late 2000s recession better than most states, with unemployment substantially lower than the rest of the nation.If the economy is measured by gross domestic product, in 2005 Iowa's GDP was about $124 billion. If measured by gross state product, for 2005 it was $113.5 billion. Its per capita income for 2006 was $23,340.On July 2, 2009, Standard & Poor's rated the state of Iowa's credit as AAA (the highest of its credit ratings, held by only 11 U.S. state governments).As of December 2015, the state's unemployment rate is 3.4%.\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nManufacturing is the largest sector of Iowa's economy, with $20.8 billion (21%) of Iowa's 2003 gross state product. Major manufacturing sectors include food processing, heavy machinery, and agricultural chemicals. Sixteen percent of Iowa's workforce is dedicated to manufacturing.Food processing is the largest component of manufacturing.

Iowa ranks fifth in the nation in total number of organic farms. In 2016, there were approximately 732 organic farms in the state, an increase of about 5% from the previous year, and 103,136 organic acres, an increase of 9,429 from the previous year. Iowa has also seen an increase in demand for local, sustainably-grown food. Northeast Iowa, part of the Driftless Area, has led the state in development of its regional food system and grows and consumes more local food than any other region in Iowa.Iowa's Driftless Region is also home to the nationally recognized Seed Savers Exchange, a non-profit seed bank housed at an 890-acre heritage farm near Decorah, in the northeast corner of the state. The largest nongovernmental seed bank of its kind in the United States, Seed Savers Exchange safeguards more than 20,000 varieties of rare, heirloom seeds.As of 2007, the direct production and sale of conventional agricultural commodities contributed only about 3.5% of Iowa's gross state product. In 2002 the impact of the indirect role of agriculture in Iowa's economy, including agriculture-affiliated business, was calculated at 16.4% in terms of value added and 24.3% in terms of total output. This was lower than the economic impact of non-farm manufacturing, which accounted for 22.4% of total value added and 26.5% of total output. Iowa's main conventional agricultural commodities are hogs, corn, soybeans, oats, cattle, eggs, and dairy products. Iowa is the nation's largest producer of ethanol and corn and some years is the largest grower of soybeans. In 2008, the 92,600 farms in Iowa produced 19% of the nation's corn, 17% of the soybeans, 30% of the hogs, and 14% of the eggs.\n\nAs of 2009 major Iowa agricultural product processors include Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Inc., Diamond V Mills, and Quaker Oats.\n\n\n=== Health insurance ===\nAs of 2014, there were 16 organizations offering health insurance products in Iowa, per the State of Iowa Insurance Division.\nIowa was the 4th out of 10 states with the biggest drop in competition levels of health insurance between 2010 and 2011, per the 2013 annual report on the level of competition in the health insurance industry by the American Medical Association using 2011 data from HealthLeaders-Interstudy, the most comprehensive source of data on enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), point-of-service (POS) and consumer-driven health care plans.\nAccording to the AMA annual report from 2007 Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield had provided 71% of the state's health insurance.The Iowa Insurance Division \"Annual report to the Iowa Governor and the Iowa Legislature\" from November 2014 looked at the 95% of health insurers by premium, which are 10 companies. It found Wellmark Inc. to dominate the three health insurance markets it examined (individual, small group and large group) at 52\u201367%. Wellmark HealthPlan of Iowa and Wellmark Inc had the highest risk-based capital percentages of all 10 providers at 1158% and 1132%, respectively.

The state sales tax rate is 6%, with non-prepared food having no tax. Iowa has one local option sales tax that may be imposed by counties after an election. Property tax is levied on the taxable value of real property. Iowa has more than 2,000 taxing authorities. Most property is taxed by more than one taxing authority. The tax rate differs in each locality and is a composite of county, city or rural township, school district and special levies. Iowa allows its residents to deduct their federal income taxes from their state income taxes.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Interstate highways ===\n\nIowa has four primary interstate highways. Interstate 29 (I-29) travels along the state's western edge through Council Bluffs and Sioux City. I-35 travels from the Missouri state line to the Minnesota state line through the state's center, including Des Moines. I-74 begins at I-80 just northeast of Davenport. I-80 travels from the Nebraska state line to the Illinois state line through the center of the state, including Council Bluffs, Des Moines, Iowa City, and the Quad Cities. I-380 is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, which travels from I-80 near Iowa City through Cedar Rapids ending in Waterloo and is part of the Avenue of the Saints highway.

It is periodically updated by the Iowa Legislative Service Bureau, with a new edition published in odd-numbered years and a supplement published in even-numbered years.\nIowa is an alcohol monopoly or alcoholic beverage control state.\n\n\n=== National ===\n\nThe two U.S. Senators:\n\nChuck Grassley (R), in office since 1981\nJoni Ernst (R), in office since 2015The four U.S. Representatives:\n\nAbby Finkenauer (D), First district\nDave Loebsack (D), Second district\nCindy Axne (D), Third district\nSteve King (R), Fourth districtAfter the 2010 United States Census and the resulting redistricting, Iowa lost one seat in Congress, falling to four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Incumbent U.S. Representatives Leonard Boswell (D) and Tom Latham (R) ran against each other in 2012 in the third congressional district which had new boundaries; Latham won and retired after the 2014 elections. King represented the old fifth congressional district.\n\n\n=== Political parties ===\n\nIn Iowa, the term \"political party\" refers to political organizations which have received two percent or more of the votes cast for president or governor in the \"last preceding general election\". Iowa recognizes three political parties\u2014the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the Libertarian Party. The Libertarian Party obtained official political party status in 2017 as a result of presidential candidate Gary Johnson receiving 3.8% of the Iowa vote in the 2016 general election. Third parties, officially termed \"nonparty political organizations\", can appear on the ballot as well. Four of these have had candidates on the ballot in Iowa since 2004 for various positions: the Constitution Party, the Green Party, the Pirate Party, and the Socialist Workers Party.\n\n\n=== Voter trends ===\n\nAs a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the Iowa General Assembly: the House had a Republican majority, while the Senate had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senate. Incumbent Democratic governor Chet Culver was defeated in 2010 by Republican Terry Branstad, who had served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in U.S. history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3 days; eclipsing George Clinton, who served 21 years until 1804. Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds succeeded him on May 24, 2017, following Branstad's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to China.\nAs of February 1, 2016, there were 2,095,639 registered voters. 635,687 or 30.3% were Democrats, 800,629 or 38.2% of voters were not registered in a party, 651,039 or 31.1% were Republicans, and 8,284 or 0.004% were registered with another party.\n\n\n=== Presidential caucus ===\n\nThe state gets considerable attention every four years because the Iowa caucus, gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. The caucuses, held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a presidential primary election.\nAlong with the New Hampshire primary the following week, Iowa's caucuses have become the starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president. The national and international media give Iowa and New Hampshire extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage. In 2007 presidential campaign spending was the seventh highest in the country.\n\n\n=== Civil rights ===\n\n\n==== Racial equality ====\n\nIn the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the very first decision of the Iowa Supreme Court\u2014In Re the Matter of Ralph, decided July 1839\u2014the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War. The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban miscegenation statutes nationwide.The Iowa Supreme Court decided Clark v. The board of directors in 1868, ruling that racially segregated \"separate but equal\" schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before Brown v. Board of Education. By 1875, a number of additional court rulings effectively ended segregation in Iowa schools. Social and housing discrimination continued against Blacks at state universities until the 1950s. The Court heard Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co. in 1873, ruling against racial discrimination in public accommodations 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: \"All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement.\" However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing de facto discrimination to continue. Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in State of Iowa v. Katz that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when Edna Griffin was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore. Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965.\n\n\n==== Women's rights ====\nAs with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes. In 1847, the University of Iowa became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis. In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting Arabella A. Mansfield to the practice of law. Several attempts to grant full voting rights to Iowa women were defeated between 1870 and 1919. In 1894 women were given \"partial suffrage\", which allowed them to vote on issues, but not for candidates. It was not until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment that women had full suffrage in Iowa. Although Iowa supported the Federal Equal Rights Amendment, in 1980 and 1992 Iowa voters rejected an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution. Iowa added the word \"women\" to the Iowa Constitution in 1998. After the amendment, it reads: \"All men and women are, by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights\u2014among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\"In May 2018 Iowa signed into law one of the country's most restrictive abortion bans: the requirement that a doctor cannot perform an abortion if they can detect a fetal heartbeat, which in many cases would restrict abortions pregnancies less than six weeks old. It was struck down in January 2019, when an Iowa state judge ruled that the \"fetal heartbeat\" law was unconstitutional.\n\n\n==== LGBT rights ====\n\nThe state's law criminalizing same-sex sexual activity was repealed in June 1976, 27 years before Lawrence v. Texas. In 2007, the Iowa Legislature added \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" to the protected classes listed in the Iowa Civil Rights Act.On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court decided Varnum v. Brien, holding in a unanimous decision, the state's law forbidding same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. This made Iowa the third state in the U.S. and first in the Midwest to permit same-sex marriage.\n\n\n== Sister jurisdictions ==\nIowa has ten official partner jurisdictions:\n Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan (1960)\n Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico (1964)\n Hebei Province, People's Republic of China (1983)\n Terengganu, Malaysia (1987)\n Taiwan, Republic of China (1989)\n Stavropol Krai, USSR/Russia (1989)\n Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine (1996)\n Veneto Region, Italy (1997)\n Republic of Kosovo (2013)\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nIowa was one of the leading states in the high school movement, and continues to be among the top educational performers today.The four-year graduation rate for high schoolers was 91.3% in 2017. Iowa's schools are credited with the highest graduation rate in the nation as of 2019. Iowa has 333 school districts, 1,329 school buildings and has the 14th lowest student-to-teacher ratio of 14.2. Teacher pay is ranked 22nd, with the average salary being $55,647.As of 2015 transportation spending is a significant part of the budgets of rural school districts as many are geographically large and must transport students across vast distances. This reduces the amount of money spent on other aspects of the districts.The state's oldest functioning school building is located in Bellevue in the historic Jackson County Courthouse which has been in continuous use as a school since 1848.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe Iowa Board of Regents is composed of nine citizen volunteers appointed by the governor to provide policymaking, coordination, and oversight of the state's three public universities, two special K\u201312 schools, and affiliated centers.The special K\u201312 schools include the Iowa School for the Deaf in Council Bluffs and the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School in Vinton. Both Iowa State University and The University of Iowa are research universities and members of the prestigious Association of American Universities. In addition to the three state universities, Iowa has multiple private colleges and universities.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nThe Clint Eastwood movie The Bridges of Madison County, based on the popular novel of the same name, took place and was filmed in Madison County.

Also there is public restrooms that never seem to be unlocked & a big open field for many activities such as baseball, football, etc. and a few tables for families or friends to sit in the shade.",
          "Great park. But the restrooms don't stay open for too long. Don't you think that if a park closes at 10pm the restrooms should at least be available til 9pm? Especially during the summer where we have the most sunlight and families are still at play.",

          "We had a little free time and wanted to experience this whimsical park. The hardest part of visiting this park was finding street parking. There is an online map that identifies all 31 sculptures. It was a fairly hot day so we didn't take time to listen to the 1 to 4 minute",
          "The sculpture park is about 2 city block rectangle. Some very interesting artwork to be seen. Fun to see if you can find your initials together on the largest of the pieces and probably the centerpiece of the park. I found mine! Worth a quick walk around.",
          "If you go through Des Moines and it is nice out, go to this park. It was a beautiful evening when we went. Lots of families enjoying the evening and checking out all of the beautiful sculptures within the park. I just wished we would have brought dinner so we could have stayed",
          "One of the highlights of our day in Des Moines. The weather was nice, the sculpture collection was interesting,my kids got to run around, and the garden is surrounded by lively cafes and such. Great photo ops here. FREE.",

          "If you only have time to see one thing in Des Moines, visit the downtown sculpture park. It is a community staple that never closes and never gets old. Surrounded by lunch and dinner options from $-$$$, local and chain coffee shops. Free to visit.",
          "We really enjoyed walking around and looking at all the neat sculptures. Nice area. You can park right on the street at metered parking.",
          "With all this space they could fit more in. Some of the ones that were there I could have done better in my high school welding class. I guess art is in the eye of the beholder. The descriptive plaques don't line up with what you are looking at and it wasn't until 1/2 way",
          "Great opportunity to walk outside and view unique sculptures. Explanations on signs and available audio.",

          "The park displays about 2 dozen large sculptures. Some of my favorite sculptures are the two heads at the east side. A friend and I were here during the art festival recently. If you are here just to see the park, 1 hour is enough. If you want to enjoy the festival, plan on two",

          "When we saw how highly this was recommended we knew we had to put this on our list of places to visit in Des Moines. Meh. It's not great for families as all my kids wanted to do was climb on all of the sculptures and run up and down the embankments.",
          "Located in the middle of downtown, this is a great place to take a walk or a break from the hustle and bustle of your day. We stopped on our vacation after seeing reviews. There are a large amount of sculptures that you can check out (non-interactive for the most part), but",
          "Great place to visit. Came here during the set up for arts festival there were so many inspiration and imaginative pieces.",

          "I walked through the park to view the statures and thought they were just ok. I kinda felt like they just put them there to make a tourist attraction. To me none of the statures were really grand or something that was really unique.",
          "The sculpture garden has a wide variety of art in which you can view at your own pace. Most sculptures have an identification plaque and contains a number for an audio tour which you access through your phone. I\u2019m not very artsy but my 10year old & I had a fun time guessing",
          "Favorite sculptures were Ancient forest and Juno From a distance some of the sculptures don\u2019t seem as impressive as when you are standing near them. The sculptures don\u2019t have individual placards so you definitely want to get a map that has the sculptures names and descriptions.",

          "Lotsa people walking around the open grassy area of this park. Nice. Sculptures are interesting. Not a big fan of abstract art, but still worth coming to see. Liked the pumpkin, the body made out of letters and the color circle; with translucent glass and mirrors of different",

          "When we travel, I\u2019m always looking for free things that my teenage son might enjoy. The sculpture park is a great downtown green space to wander through and take pics. If I would go back, I would do the self-guided tour to learn more about the installations. If you have the",
          "The sculpture park in Des Moines is well worth seeing with pieces that are both challenging to the imagination and show a high degree of technically mastery in the work. Geometric, abstract and surreal, they are wonderful talking points and inspiring to your own ideas.",
          "There is something for everyone in this park. Some of the sculpture will not be to your liking; that\u2019s because every style is on show. It\u2019s free and it\u2019s worth a quick 20 minute stroll. Take someone with you and take some zany photos!",

          "I was looking for something to see while in Des Moines and this place was recommended. Now I believe it would have been a little more enjoyable in sunny warm snowless weather but it still was fun. I didn't use the app for the guided tour. i just walked around the park and",
          "Our oldest grand kids on telling them we were going to the sculpture park a few years ago said what\u2019s that and we don\u2019t want to go there.

          "There are tons of Pokemon things here-so says my husband and 13 year old who play it. We enjoy walking around, Pokemon hunting, and enjoying the artwork at this park. It is always clean and people are very friendly at it.",

          "It was a beautiful day. Blue skies and temp in the 50's. We stayed in downtown Des Moines. Our fist time ever to Des Moines. We walked the skywalk to the sculpture park. It was awesome!! More sculptures than I ever imagined. Very impressive. Take the time to visit this. It's",

          "Give your negative politics a rest- if you have any about the owner of Papa John's and enjoy a great place for a walk. You can dine at several nearby restaurants or an ice cream store and then take 45 minutes out of an evening of viewing some wonderful outdoor art.",
          "Stopped by Black Cat Ice Cream and walked around the Sculpture Garden as we ate it. A unique and fun collection of sculptures! A great layout as the art was well spaced and easy to enjoy. Suggest coming early or late in the day in the summer as there isn't much shade.",

          "You can walk around the park in 30 minutes, some sculptures are fun to look at, others are simply ghastly creations of the human mind. At night they\u2019re illuminated, so it\u2019s a little more attractive. The truth is that our children had more fun rolling down the little hills than",
          "It is a nice place to stop for a few minutes. Nothing special though. You can walk around, take pictures, and get back in your car in no time. I would never go out of my way to see the park. Honestly there are many other places in Des Moines where you can enjoy better art. Do",
          "Traveled to Des Moines with a friend for the weekend and spent the day walking around downtown. This park was a nice reprieve from the busier areas of the city.",

          "IF you're in the area, then by all means walk around. However, don't make a special trip to see it. There are no explanations by any of the statues. So you just walk around it for 10-15 min.",
          "Not worth the cost of parking. I wouldn\u2019t waste your time. A handful of statues only. Worst part was there wasn\u2019t a Papa Johns nearby.",
          "We really enjoyed walking around this lovely park area and observing the sculptures. Admittedly, when we read the descriptions in the brochure back at our hotel, we were baffled by the meanings but the sculptures were fascinating nonetheless.",

You\u2019ll have to come down and see for yourself :) it\u2019s easy to get too and doesn\u2019t take to long at all to stroll though so it\u2019s worth checking out :) they also have phone guided tours so that\u2019s always a plus \ud83d\ude1b",

          "Nice green space downtown. Tech boys working in the area prolly enjoy lunch there on nice days. There are a few nice pieces but overall it fails as a sculpture garden. Locals don\u2019t talk about it much unless there is a festival or food truck gathering or something else going on",

          "This is an interesting stop, but I wouldn't call this an \"attraction\" exactly. It's about a block wide and it's got some sculptures, but most of them are bizarre beyond words, and the title blocks for the pieces offer no insight. Interesting, but not great.",
          "The grounds have been carefully sited to enhance each piece. This was way better than I expected. Great space for contemplative walk.",
          "Good art is art to which one can return again and again. We've been to this sculpture garden many times and have enjoyed aspects of the art we've overlooked before. One can get lost in the art and and in thought. The topography sets off the artworks complementarily.",
          "I love this piece of green space that has a couple of hills to enjoy the art at different angles. I have watched this sculpture park mature over the past few years. It just needs a few more trees to enhance the overall ambience. Great place for artsy pictures.",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but it's not too far from downtown so if you're in the area it's worth checking out. I noticed a few sculptures were missing as well which was disappointing. Also kids were climbing all over some of them making it hard to get a clear picture",

          "The sculptures ranged from fascinating to blah, but the signage and the free brochures made it accessible and more-interesting. A few pieces made this really worth seeing (the ones in my pictures, and everyone else's too, I have noticed!).",
          "Nice place to walk around to see art and relax. It doesn't take very long just to walk the park but if you listen to the audio tour it could take a while. If I lived in Des Moines or visited often I would choose one each time to listen to and increase my art knowledge. The art",

          "I am impressed by the art and architecture in downtown Des Moines. The Sculpture Garden is a great place for a stroll or to hangout while you have lunch.",
          "The pieces on display are thought provoking. They're spaced apart from each other so that you can take each one in. We went on a super frigid day, so not many people were around. Note that you will need to park at a meter, so bring coins or you can pay with a credit card. We",
          "Wonderful park with some large \"other world\" type sculptures. Nice wandering cement paths for dog walking and art enjoying. Seemed to be plenty of metered parking available. Be sure you bring a camera and pick up after your pet. The state capitol dome can be seen just down the",
          "Like no other sculpture display. This is an entire park dedicated to amazing sculptures. Some made of bronze, some metal, some stone. Some lifesize, some huge. I especially like the invisible man in the bronze coat. But, I dont get the red metal I beams. Looks like someone",
          "These sculptures are fun to see in person and are surrounded by restaurants within walking distance. Definitely a fun addition to an afternoon trip!",
          "Located in downtown Des Moines, this sculpture park is worth a visit. Features unique and surprising works.",
          "We enjoyed the art. It was quite cold however so we walked quickly! I'd like to see more landscaping perhaps to make the site more varied and interesting.",
          "This park is definitely worth a visit. You can leisurely stroll among the modern sculptures that are interesting to check out and hang out when the weather is good.",
          "I have toured the park five times. It covers several city blocks. There are paved sidewalks that run between the various objects. There are brass plates that tell the name of each work of art. You can tour the park in an hour on a nice warm, sunny day.",
          "We didn't know about this park before arriving to Des Moines. But it was so well signed we decided to check it. We weren't sorry. It's cool. It's suitable for everybody. And it's free. Finding a parking spot was easy.",
          "This park is in a central downtown location, perfect for eating lunch on the lawn, going for a brisk walk, or playing pokemon go ;) It you would like to spend anytime outdoors near downtown Des Moines, I would highly recommend this park.",
          "Had a wonderful time with friends over Thanksgiving break. Ate a bite at Americana then walked through the park. Great place for a photo opp!",
          "The Des Moines Sculpture park is on the West side of downtown Des Moines with parking all around and easy access to a quick oasis of art and turf downtown. My children love to run around the art and get different angles of the artwork and it is a perfect stroll after dinner!",
          "There was a lot of sculptures and art. Nothing AMAZING but nonetheless very interesting. It's a nice view of you want to go for a walk or even a jog.",
          "This is a great place in the middle of Des Moines Iowa. Wonderful sculptures and a beautiful park like setting.",
          "We took two of our adult children to the Pappajohn Sculpture Park when they were in Des Moines visiting, and they were totally impressed by the number and variety of unique art pieces that are permanently displayed here. You won't be disappointed if you take the time to explore",
          "There are some very neat scupltures in this garden and there is also one my 4 year old says looks like \"poop.\" I am not a modern art person, I guess I like my art where I can figure out what it is. This is all very abstract and honestly, makes me wonder why anyone would make",
          "We enjoyed an evening stroll thru the unique and interesting sculpture park. The variety of sculptures is amazing. The sidewalk easily take you from point to point and the ability to walk thru the grass or sit on the lawn and enjoy the sculptures is a great option. Lots of",
          "The sculpture garden is a rather unique and unusual feature of the downtown area. I recommend calling the number and hearing the guided tour which gives background on the artists and the sculptures. There is a great variety of work. I enjoyed an evening stroll looking at them",
          "Nice park located very near to the Capitol building and Downtown. Good for a nice troll along the park and see various sculptures. Parking is on the streets and could be difficult to find on a busy day!",
          "We loved the fact you could wander around all the sculptures for free. We were lucky to have a gloriously beautiful day to explore and the variety is enormous. As with all artwork, we liked some better than others, but this was a great way to see a bit more of Des Moines. If you",
          "The sculpture park is a nice place to take a walk in the city. I find some of the sculptures disturbing and difficult to understand. I am sure it is a wonderful place for people who enjoy that style of art.",
          "Located close to dining, hotels, and a brewery, this sculpture garden is a wonderful green space for the whole family to enjoy, though it was hard for even me (an adult) to not want to climb on certain statuary - just be mindful of the art. The pieces displayed are wonderful to",
          "A nice open block that is stocked with a number of sculptures that are interesting as you roam around. A number of places to sit and have lunch around the park. Not very large with a limited number of sculptures so don't throw too much money in the metered parking that is",
          "Great picture park and lovely open grassy areas. There are several additions since we last enjoyed it.",
          "If you are in downtown Des Moines then it is a decent place to walk through. However it was not something worth making an effort for.",
          "Had a great visit and walk around the art. Has cell phone walking tour also. Beautiful grounds, well maintained.",
          "Tucked away in downtown Des Moines this is such a great place for a walk almost any time of day. Initially we planned just a drive through, but we had to stop and explore many of the fantastic pieces. Don't get too close, a voice comes out of no where saying please back away",
          "We went there for the food truck festival and enjoyed wandering amongst the sculptures. Truly a wide variety of art.",
          "Stopped on a whim for a late afternoon stroll - what a great and calming place! Be careful as it can get crowded quickly. I highly recommend a weekday jaunt through this great park!",
          "Lovely surprise downtown, a real gem. I always check this out when I'm visiting. Nice place for a walk or photos.",
          "I was in Des Moines for a conference and took a 7 block walk to visit the park. What a great experience. The park is wonderful. It is fully accessible and has lots of information on the sculptures and the artists. I loved the park and really liked the engraved stainless steel",
          "It was a beautiful day and figured I had a hour before sunset to view the sculptures. Parking is free on the weekend and each sculpture has a number assigned to you so you can call a phone number and get all the information about the artist and the sculpture which I thought was",
          "Beautiful! Very unique sculptures. Glad we visited the park while we were in town. We went at night so it is pretty nice the way they light them all up. Turned out there was a pokemon go event, so there was a lot of people there that night.",
          "This public free sculpture garden in downtown Des Moines is fantastic. There are about 3 dozen sculptures spread across a grassy lawn to walk around and take in. If you are disappointed I personally will refund your admission fee. Go to 1330 Grand Ave and start you walk. 20",
          "Always nice when a city allows for an open green space. The modern sculptures make this a desirable place around which to live or through which to walk.",
          "This sculpture park is ok. The reviews said go at night. We were there at dusk turning into night. Not sure what the big deal is. I could do most of these sculptures and I have no artistic talent. Not all that impressed.",
          "The art may not be everyone's taste but it is definitely worth a look. There are a lot of abstract pieces, there are a few that are just pretty and some that really make you go \"hmmm...?\". It is not an all day event, although once you're done with the sculptures it's fun to",
          "This was a nice little park with some interesting artwork. The size is about 1 or 2 city blocks and there is plenty to look at. They have some pretty abstract artwork, and there looks to be a lot a people visiting there often.",
          "I went to the sculpture park with my art club. It was very enjoyable except for all the bees and wasps.",
          "This is an interesting place to tour but I would not go great lengths to see it. Its about a square block in the downtown of a small city that is spread out. A nice social place for people to gather. Some sculptures were very interesting and others not so much. There is no",
          "I love visiting the Papajohn Sculpture Park in Des Moines. There are so many interesting pieces, and it is a highlight of the downtown Des Moines experience. And, free and open to the public night and day!",
          "I like the idea of having a park in a city to provide a place for people to gather and enjoy the outside and each other. The art was primarily abstract. The rainbow color panels was our favorite display.",
          "I used to live downtown and walk around this area. Very interesting sculptures and designs; Totally worth the while and spending some time watching and enjoying a sunny day in the park. Its probably a 30 min visit, then just walk back downtown and enjoy the city life.",
          "The sculptures are quite large. There is definitely a variety. An outdoor museum. There are paths that you can follow to them.",
          "The bunny and the man made of letters are worth a quick stop and quarter for parking in anyone's book. Lovely set up and we were in an out in about 20 minutes...we aren't the type to ponder art!",
          "We saw it when we were going to Exile Brewery and came back to check it out. It's a nice walk for a nice day and the sculptures are interesting, some amazing!",
          "Pappajohn Sculpture Park is not just for the art crowd, but an excellent venue for all ages to enjoy. It has a variety of types of sculpture, all of varying sizes and shapes that can be enjoyed at several different angles of the park. It is very clean and well kept, downtown",
          "This is somewhere you can stroll and visit any season of the year. It is free and always very intriguing for new eyes and new visitors to downtown and very intriguing for regulars. Kids love it too.",
          "This is a fun park with lots of neat sculptures. I liked the one with all the different colored glass that you can go inside. However, people really just go to catch lots of Pokemon. There were 4 lures in he park when I went, and the park was swarming with parents and kids",
          "We had been going down to the sculpture park for several weekends now. It is always clean and maintained.",
          "The location is great and the statues are very interesting. They have plaques and cell phone audio tours for each (though we could not get one to load properly) Great family place to get some exercise and culture all at once",
          "It's nice to have a park in the heart of downtown. I love all of the interesting art features which they change up quite frequently. If you work downtown it a nice place to go to get outside and enjoy some fresh air and enjoy the beauty of the city.",
          "The nature of sculpture is static, but the people who have designed the Pappajohn Sculpture Park have really done an incredible job in making the experience active, interactive and a fun place to visit. This venue is great for Artists, Young Couples, Children, Adults,",
          "Wonderful park. Relaxing/eaceful environment and unique artwork. If in Des Moines, surely worth a visit!",
          "We had so much fun walking around looking at these sculptures. Some were deep and thoughtful and others were just whimsy.",
          "Huge exercise class was in process in sculpture garden while we passed by on way to Saturday Farmers' Market. On Friday we bought lunch from a food truck and enjoyed the nearby Meredith Test Garden. The sculptures are weird but the space is fun and friendly.",
          "We toured the sculpture garden with friends and it was a nice venue to walk and talk but not overly impressive. It's good it is free and for that, I would recommend at least one visit.",
          "My gal was more impressed than I but we were both glad we visited. On our way out of town, we pulled over and parked on the street alongside the park. We fed the meter 20 minutes worth and that's about how long we needed to explore the works. We really appreciate philanthropic",
          "Lots of items to view. Many different mediums. Day we were there they had a wedding party there also taking pictures",
          "Fantastic place for cool photos. Wish there were a few more places to sit or to hangout on the green space.",
          "OMG. It's just wonderful. Full disclosure--back in the 1980s, I worked at the Des Moines Art Center and loved the city. But this is really a new and hoppin' place. But back to the Sculpture Park. It's a grassy set of slopes with important and beautifully sited sculptures. It is",
          "very close to downtown Des Moines. I liked seeing the new copper library and then the park. I had good Vietnamese food afterwards at A Dong",
          "This sculpture park is free. It's a city block square. All the sculptures are tagged with the artist's name and the year completed. We enjoyed the walk-about.",
          "The sculptures are really neat and detailed. Had fun taking pictures of it and really enjoyed the park too. Stop by here if you're around the area. Really cool sculptures!",
          "Awesome place to walk around and check out some cool and interesting art, there was even a food truck parked on the corner just a neat place to go, especially if you are into Pok\u00e9mon Go lots of pokestops and tons of drowzee",
          "If you want to see a collection of uniques art, this is a must see in the Midwest. This is such a fine collection that it is used as a backdrop for one of the most exclusive art shows in the country. Close to dining, library, and other amenities as well.",
          "There are so many beautiful sculptures to look at. All are so different yet all make quite a statement. Great to just wander through here and plenty of stops to sit and soak it all up.",
          "The Pappajohn family had all of these sculptures in their yard and donated them to the City for the sculpture walk. It's definitely worth the walk thru the park - each sculpture is totally unique and one of a kind.",
          "We had gone to the art museum earlier that afternoon and decided to stop by the outdoor sculpture park before leaving town, and we're very glad we did!",
          "So glad our city is trying to build its culture and provide some art abd green spaces. However, the selection of art pieces is atrocious! You have black and white balls, a crazy mean looking rabbit, items that look like kidney beans, again in metal and not pretty. With as much",
          "Lots of great areas to sit and relax while the kids ran around catching Pokemon. Lots of families enjoying the park and spending time together. The kids had lots of fun and we were able to relax under a shade tree.",
          "My wife and I went there to check out the art. Our two kids (11 and 13) were there for Pokemon Go. My guess is that about 20% were there for art, 80% for Pokemon Go. Which was fine with us; it was good to see so many people at the attraction compared to the last time we were",
          "Thanks to John & Mary Pappajohn Des Moines has an A rated sculpture garden. Relaxing. Excellent variety of grade A pieces. Surrounded by nice eating establishments. Come yourself and place to be Des Moines proud with out of town guests!",
          "What makes this park special is that it is a beautifully laid out sculpture park that serves as a welcome to the downtown and is free of charge. The sculptures represented works by well known contemporary artists. There was no evidence of vandalism and there were many people",
          "The park is nicely set up and it was good to stretch the legs a little and walk around to the different sculptures. There are not a lot, but it is free, and according to the sign there is an audio tour you can look up. If you miss it don't worry about it, but if you want a nice",
          "It was fun! I brought my dogs with me and took pictures with the sculptures. They have a lot of sculptures and at night it is all lit up. Parking you have to pay with meter so heads up there. Also a lot of people there playing Pokemon go! I would definitely make it a point to",
          "I'd never been to Des Moines before, so we decided to visit the sculpture park while in the area. On street parking is coin meters. Unfortunately, I didn't have any change with me. The 1st parking garage that I pulled into was also coin metered. I finally found a garage that",
          "Nice place to walk and see a wide range of sculptures in a variety of materials. I saw a few of sculptors I had heard off.",
          "Pokemon Go and sculpture fun. Great way to connect with your teenage kids. Stations are there to call and find out more about the sculptures.",
          "Very nice. Enjoyed all the sculptures and the park area. Very pretty and kept nice. I think everyone should visit it once.",
          "it is a great place to visit if you have never seen it. it add a very nice green space for downtown. Lately has been over ran by pokemon players",
          "I'm not much into the avant-garde and modernist art thing. I'm told it is a great sculpture park. There a several pieces there I just don't get, but then again, I'm not an art person. The green space is very nice. In a nice area and well maintained. It's a nice place to walk",
          "There are so many neat and different sculptures in a space that is big enough that it's not crowded, but yet small enough that you can see everything. Plenty of photo ops and very easy to get around, even for those that have difficulty walking.",
          "People seem to love this place. I've lived in Des Moines for awhile now and never understood the hype. If you like really abstract art then I guess you'd like this place but the art kinda looks like a joke to me. The things they call some of the pieces is ridiculous. The piece",
          "High quality sculptures set outdoors near the west end of downtown Des Moines. Many sculptures by recognized artists. My fave is the metal human form composed of letters of the alphabet. It speaks of our inextricable link with language & symbol. Powerful!",
          "very relaxing just looking at the art sculptures and just going for a stroll by yourself or with friends",
          "After seeing the sculpture parks of Loveland, CO we were a little disappointed in the size of the park. However, with that being said it was a pleasant hour spent walking around the park, watching people and admiring the art we understood. Each to his own. And it was free and",
          "This park has a tremendous amount of art that will just make you stop and appreciate it. It's called pappajohns not because of the pizza, that's what I thought for like years, it turns out all the art was either at the house of a business man whose last name was Pappajohn. The",
          "We were driving cross country and needed a great place to take a little break. This was the perfect location. The sculptures were lovely, the grass is perfectly maintained and there were some fun food trucks on the perimeter to provide lunch. It was just great!!",
          "We liked it. Simple. Nice grassy spot downtown to walk on barefoot. Right-size for younger fams and grandparents. Great addition to the Arts Festival. Think I could have made some of this stuff...ha...",
          "Whilst I'm no art critic I enjoyed looking at the free sculpture park named after the Pappajohns. Well laid out and you can spend as long as you want there. It's free.",
          "Very nice to visit, especially since it is free! The sculptures were very interesting and thought provoking. You can spend as little or as much time as you want to. We found the park on trip advisors and also an app I have called \"Roadside Attractions\". I felt alittle silly",
          "While the Papajohn Sculpture Park is a great attraction to visit, be warned some of the sculptures are a bit questionable. There are several along Grand Avenue resembling giant spiders & larvae. Strange yet worth the visit assuming you go with low expectations. As compared to",
          "My husband and I enjoyed a stroll through the park, while the rest.of humanity stared at their phones. Quite comical & enjoyed the peacefulness!",
          "The Sculptures were interesting, and the park well taken care of, but it was crowded with Pokeman players... Not sure I understand...",
          "This was a nice surprise in the city. Great place to wander leisurely in the outdoors. Unique art, great story behind it.",
          "The sculptures are awesome! My boyfriend is not very big into art, but he loved it! The alphabet head is very cool. You can walk right into it, it's huge! The mirror/color exhibit is awesome! You can see about 20 reflections of yourself. It made for some really nice pictures.",
          "This was a very interesting sculpture garden with some very distinctive sculptures. My favorite was the head made out of the alphabet which was big enough to walk inside of it.",
          "Visited the park in the daylight and then returned at night to see that several sculptures were more interesting during the evening.",
          "Neat little park. The kids enjoyed stretching their legs and running around. There was plenty of metered parking along both sides. It was $0.45 for 1 hour. There were also some restaurants right around the park you could grab food at. I don't think it's something we'd do again,",
          "Spent an easy hour meandering the park. Someone has more creative ability than I. Take a camera, and stretch your imagination.",
          "I absolutely loved seeing this place! All the sculptures are a sight to see. So beautiful! My kids enjoyed running around while I was able to enjoy the art.",
          "One square block of large sculptures with a small plaque identifying the artist, year and name of the piece. Some of the pieces are interactive and kids seemed to be enjoying their time there. Plenty of green space to sit and enjoy the view. Wide walking path around and through",
          "This was an interesting and pleasant sculpture park in downtown Des Moines. Interactive interesting sculptures and it is free to visit. There are concerts in the park in the summer.",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Wished I would have known or at least ventured downtown more often when I lived in West Des Moines a few years back so I could see what has changed through the years. My favorite was the horses made from driftwood .",
          "We are traveling from Texas on a Midwest road trip and found this park on a list of things to do in Iowa. Our visit was on a Tuesday evening around 7:30PM which was very pleasant weather wise to be out strolling in the park. The sculptures were interesting and trying to figure",
          "a very interesting park, with many wonderful sculptures. very good for those who like to be outdoors in contact with nature.",

          "This free park in downtown Des Moines is a pleasant way to spend 10 minutes or 2 hours. There are more than 20 sculptures with winding sidewalks wandering between them. All sculptures are modern art, so if you're looking for a Rodin better head to the Des Moines Art Center. But",
          "The term world-class gets thrown about a lot and often, without merit. The sculptures in this park are truly world-class and by world renowned artists.",
          "Iowa has been great! The sculpture park and the Art Festival was a nice way to spend Saturday. Plenty of people and detailed works of art to enjoy. Children rolling down the hills brought back memories of my childhood home.",
          "This is an easy park to walk around and catch great sculptures/photos on your trip. We went with young children and teens and they LOVED it!!! Beautiful and quirky exhibits and the same time-but all very fun.",
          "A lovely park in downtown Des Moines with interesting sculptures providing an opportunity to leisurely walk around and take in the scene.",
          "I have been to this outdoor exhibit a few times and have seen something different each time. My favorite is the Nomade. Make sure you look at Moonrise from the correct angle. In downtown Des Moines, there are great restaurants nearby. It makes a nice afternoon.",
          "This is a wonderful addition to the city. We enjoyed a casual stroll to and through the garden. Not too abstract so great for a part time art viewer.",
          "This is a downtown art park. Sculptures are interesting and impressive. Plan to spend at least a couple of hours if you really want to enjoy the park. Worth the trip if you are already in the area.",

          "The City of Des Moines has outdone itself in making this homage to the sculptural arts possible. The sculptures are varied. The setting is sublime. This park creates a gateway to the city that took years to establish. It was well worth the wait.",
          "This is a great place to people watch or relax. There are several sculptures to look at (it seems more are added monthly). Right now, it's not crowded with art so there is lots of green space plus places to sit.",

          "This is a world-class sculpture park and has become a favorite destination for both out-of-town visitors and locals wanting an unusual backdrop for photographs. It's open year-round and looks different in every season. Plan to spend about an hour reading about and appreciating",
          "A small, yet wonderful park full of fascinating sculptures in downtown Des Moines. Definitely worth your time.",
          "I visited on an amazing weather day. This park as beautiful sculptures in it, and they are spread out across a huge lawn so you have enough space to admire them without bumping into anyone. There were even people lying under trees enjoying the weather. I was happy to see that",
          "This is a nice place to check out while in Des Moines. There is metered parking all around the park so make sure you have some quarters! The sculptures are well done and spread out over a large area. There is no cost to view the sculptures.",
          "There are some neat sculptures, but it's in a small area, and it's not a place I would visit more then once",
          "If you are downtown you can't miss seeing this park. Modern rabbits sit around ( like one at Washington University in St Louis) and horse like sculptures amid other larger sculptures look strangely at home together in this urban park. It is interesting to walk among the art",
          "This park was located in downtown and was near some other things we went to see. It is totally worth a half hour of time to walk around it and to see the cool sculptures.",
          "You can stroll through this park leisurely and read the provided guided tour booklet to truly understand the works of art and the artists' visions. Or you can let your kids run through the park and pose by their favorite sculpture. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy this",
          "It was a beautiful day to be outside and the walk through the slightly winding path of the Pappajohn Sculpture Park was a perfect setting. There is no admission and no gates that interfere with the beautiful pathways. The park hosts a collection of widely varying sculptures.",
          "Creative and interesting sculpture park just on the outskirts of the downtown core of Des Moines. It's a relatively small park that's easy to walk around, and the sculptures are curious, even enigmatic.",

          "My husband and I went to college in Des Moines in the 90's. We have made a few trips back and this sculpture park is unique and a lovely addition to the downtown. It makes for some cool photo ops! Highly recommend a stop. It's a quick jaunt, or take a picnic and lounge!",
          "My husband & I visited here on his business trip. Beautiful garden and easy walk and informational. The sculptures and pagoda was beautiful. Right on the river and clean. Only wish that they had a translation plaque next to the stones. All and all a very nice free garden to walk",
          "I didn't like most of the sculptures, but that is dependent on personal taste. It was nice to walk around with my husband and have something to do though.",
          "The sculpture park is a great place to just sit and even greater when the festivals and food trucks arrive. The sculptures are unique and interesting. I think everyone should see them.",
          "This sculpture park is worth your time to stop. I have been here many times, and never get tired of the works of art. It is especially beautiful at night. I was happy to see an exit for the park off of 235, and the food trucks are there. It would be a great place for lunch!",
          "You have to visit the sculpture park during the day and also at night. My favorite has to be the Kaleidoscope, great place to get special pictures. You have to bring your camera. You can get so many cool pictures. I love to also go at dusk and just sit and watch the people",
          "On a nice day, this would be a fun family activity. Great opportunity to get a little art education on vacation.",
          "The artwork displayed here is predominantly attractive and interesting. It's also very wide open. Overall a should-see if you're in the city. There is an area that I didn't like as much, as it seemed to portray \"spooky\" sculptures. I'm not a personal fan of this, nor do I think",
          "Kids will enjoy these odd sculptures and have fun running around on the grass. It is a great place to have a picnic and The Central Library is also close by (but check library's opening times.) Free fun for all.",
          "After visiting the beautiful classical capitol building, we experienced a total change of perspective by walking through this sculpture park. Very well maintained and presented. We picked up a pamphlet at one end of park and enjoyed our time appreciating the art and artist",

          "Visiting this place was a unique and interesting experience in itself. The park is very well maintained and sculptures are unique. Park is open all the time and you can also have a guided tour (call based) if that interests you. It's a small park, easily accessible and right",

          "This is all in about a 2 block space. Nothing exciting except the sculptures are super cool. Make sure you have change for the meters as there doesn't appear to be freee public parking. The sculptures are all unique and it's just a nice little walk in the middle of downtown.",
          "It's a small collection of world class sculptures. I visited on a chilly February day with my young kids who enjoyed walking most of the park before they got bored and I had to get them back in the car before I was done.",

          "I expected a bit more from this sculpture park. I visited in a cloudy day which didn't help. If you have lots of time in Des Moines then it's worth a peek. However, if your time is limited, I would skip it.",

          "Des Moines isn't a huge spot for tourists, everyone knows that. If if was, this would be like a mini version of New York central park. Many locals walk around during lunch and on nice weekends many families come out to enjoy the day. Even for people who aren't into art it can be",

          "Nice amenity in middle of downtown but it did challenge my appreciation of art. Maybe it's the more abstract I got get. My problem, maybe not yours. Glad we walked through and considered them all.",
          "This is about 2 square grass-covered blocks containing about 20 large and very creative sculptures. It's worth the trip---doesn't take very long to see them all---a half-hour or so. But you'll need to get the interpretive brochure somewhere else such as the Des Moines Art",

        "wiki": "The Basilica of St. John is a Minor Basilica of the Catholic Church in the Drake neighborhood of Des Moines, Iowa, United States. It is also a parish church in the Diocese of Des Moines. The church building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\nBishop Henry Cosgrove of the Diocese of Davenport established St. John's Parish in 1905. Its territory had been taken from St. Ambrose Parish. On June 7, of that year fourteen lots were purchased on University Avenue for about $8,000 by the Rev. Daniel F. Mulvihil, the parish's first pastor. Two more lots were bought for $1,375 on July 20. These purchases marked the beginning of St. John's parish. The school was the first building built by the parish. A chapel on the second floor served the parish as its church. The first Mass was celebrated on Christmas Day in 1905. Between 1907 and 1918 the school included both primary and secondary programs. The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary taught in the school. The high school program was discontinued when citywide Catholic high schools for boys and girls opened. In 1911 the parish became a part of the newly established Diocese of Des Moines. A brick rectory was built c. 1912 to the west of the school. The parish was incorporated on December 16, 1912.In August 1913 the basement of the present church was completed and the parish used it for its church until the upper church was completed. It was part of the designs for a new church by the Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson. The rest of that church design was not built. The architects who designed the present church were from Maginnis & Walsh of Boston. They were also responsible for the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The parish priest at St. John's, the Rev. Martin S. McNamara, was also influential in the design especially in having it based on Maginnis & Walsh's design for St. Catherine's Church in Somerville, Massachusetts (c. 1915) as well as the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome (rebuilt 1823). McNamara had previously been responsible for the design and construction of All Saints Church in Stuart, Iowa, another Maginnis & Walsh project. The local architect chosen to supervise the project was John Normile. Charles W. Wietz' Sons was the contractor who built the church building.\nThe cornerstone for the present church was laid on September 19, 1926. The footprint of the present church extends several feet beyond that of the 1913 basement.  Initially, the exterior of the church was designed to be brick because Maginnis & Walsh thought limestone was too expensive, but Father McNamara insisted he could raise the necessary funds and he did. The church was built for $480,000. The finished church was dedicated by Bishop Thomas W. Drumm on December 4, 1927. Two other Catholic bishops and over one hundred priests from the Des Moines diocese and elsewhere attended the dedication. The baldachin and high altar, designed by Maginnis & Walsh, were added in 1929. The building was also designed to have a 500-seat chapel built off to the east of the altar area, but it has never been built.\nThe first of the church's stained glass windows was installed in 1947, and the rest were installed by 1953. The widows were delayed because of the financial constraints related to the Great Depression and World War II. Conrad Pickel Studio of Waukesha, Wisconsin designed the church's 10 nave windows and the 36 clerestory windows. The church suffered water damage in fires on February 18, 1961 and February 6, 1970, but they did not cause any serious damage. A new convent was built across the street to the west of the church. \nA temporary free-standing altar was set up for the priest to face the people in 1964. The first vernacular Mass in Des Moines was celebrated at St. John's by Msgr. Edward Pfeffer, the chancellor of the diocese. The present altar used for liturgy was consecrated on June 5, 1983. That same year an addition designed by Higgins, Shirk & Colvig of Des Moines was added on the east side of the church and connects it to the rectory. It reflects the basilica's original design and provides a handicap entrance into the church. The Conrad Pickel Studio also designed the stained glass windows for the east addition.\nThe church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 8, 1987. Pope John Paul II elevated St. John's Church to a Minor Basilica on October 4, 1989.  Bishop William H. Bullock presided at the dedication liturgy on December 31, 1989.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nSt. John's was designed in the basilica form of the Romanesque Revival style found in Northern Italy known as Lombardy Romanesque.  The church is built of Indiana limestone that was probably acquired from Tri-Cities' Stone Company of Davenport, Iowa. The stone veneer is applied to the exterior in a random ashlar pattern. The cut stone trim was provided by Rowat Cut Stone Company of Des Moines. The church measures 138 by 80 feet (42 by 24 m) and has a 115-foot (35 m) campanile on the west rear of the building that contains a 600-pound (270 kg) bell that was cast in 1961. The bell was installed by the I.T. Verdin Company of Cincinnati. Over the main entrance is a sculptural frame that includes a figure of Christ and angels. It is supported by columns in the Corinthian order with acanthus designs. The building is covered by a red tile roof, and the tower is capped by a bronze cross.\nThe interior of the basilica is finished in plaster cast and travertine marble. The barrel vaulted coffered ceiling covered in gold leaf rises 50 feet (15 m) above the floor. The main nave is flanked by side aisles. Des Moines artist Dominic Damiana painted a mural of Christ the King surrounded by symbols of the Four Evangelists on the gilded upper section of the apse. The columns of the baldachin are Bescia marble and the high altar is Botticino marble. The clerestory windows depict the sacraments, cardinal virtues of the church, and offices and teachings of humankind. Below the windows are Scripture quotes relating to the institution of the sacraments and another set of quotes from the popular devotional prayer the Hail Mary. Below the quotes are a set of marble disks that symbolize the universality of the church. The church has a seating capacity of 900 people.\n\n\n== Pipe organ ==\nThe basilica's pipe organ is a 1963 Casavant Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e., Opus 2723. The organ is located in the rear gallery of the church. Some of the pipes are exposed and frame the rose window. The traditional style console with roll top is in the center of the instrument in a fixed position. The organ features two manuals, three divisions, 30 stops, 30 registers, 38 ranks and 1,998 pipes. The manual compass is 61 notes and the pedal compass is 32 notes. The organ also has electro-pneumatic (EP) chests, drawknobs in vertical rows on angled jambs, balanced swell shoes/pedals and standard AGO placement. Rounding out the features are adjustable combination pistons, AGO Standard (concave radiating) pedalboard, crescendo pedal, reversible full organ/tutti toe stud, combination action thumb pistons and coupler reversible toe studs.\nStop list:\n\n\n== Charity work ==\nIn 1992, the Basilica of St. John joined with seven other churches in the Des Moines area and created the Churches United Shelter (now the Central Iowa Shelter), to combat homelessness in the area.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBasilica of St. John\nPhotos of the Basilica of St. John",

        "wiki": "West Des Moines is a city in Polk, Dallas, and Warren counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. Most of the city is in Polk County, with slivers extending into Dallas and Warren counties.\nAs of the 2010 census the city population was 56,609, with the United States Census Bureau estimating a population of 67,899 in 2019. West Des Moines is the second-largest city in the Des Moines metropolitan area and the sixth-largest city in Iowa. It ranked 94th in Money magazine's list of the \"100 Best Places to Live and Launch\" in 2008, 77th and 57th on the 100 Best Places to Live in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and 18th on the Hipster Cities of 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe West Des Moines area used to be home to the Sac and Fox tribes. Near the stroke of midnight on October 11, 1845 a gunshot was fired by a cattle farmer, James Cunningham Jordan (1813\u20131893) to declare that the area was open for Anglo-European settlement. His residence, the Jordan House, has been restored and is now home to the West Des Moines Historical Society. The Jordan House was a stop on the Underground Railroad, and abolitionist John Brown stayed on Jordan property multiple time, at least once while escorting a group of freedom seeking slaves to Canada. In West Des Moines' early years, the town was a trading and shipping junction. West Des Moines incorporated as the city of Valley Junction on October 9, 1893.\nIn its early days Valley Junction was home to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's switching facilities and repair shops due to its location at the junction of several railroad lines. The Rock Island's facilities moved out of Valley Junction and back into Des Moines in 1936.\nThe speed limit of ten miles (16 km) an hour had existed in Valley Junction since 1911 for all automobiles. But in 1915 an Englishman named Jack Prince built a one-mile (1.6 km) oval race track, designed to let race cars break that speed limit ten times over. The wooden track was made of 980,000 feet (300,000 m) of 2x4's laid on edge. It was one of 24 such tracks nationwide; with seating for over 10,000 people. On August 7, 1915, the eyes of the auto world were on Valley Junction in anticipation of the fastest 300-mile (480 km) auto race in history. Ralph DePalma, winner of the Indianapolis 500 that year, was one of at least a dozen drivers vying for the $10,000 purse. Before a crowd of 7,000 people, a tire blew, lunging Joe Cooper's car over the rail. Cooper was killed and his mechanic was injured. Later while rounding a curb, a wheel of Billy Chandler's Duesenberg failed, cartwheeling the car into the infield and fatally injuring his mechanic, Maurice Keeler. Chandler was seriously injured. Smiling Ralph Mulford won the race with DePalma a close 2nd. This baptism by blood left a bad taste in the mouth of the locals, and the track was closed two years later. The wood was salvaged and then used to construct buildings in Valley Junction.\nThe serious dilemma of school overcrowding was partially addressed in 1916. The bond issue to build a new high school for $50,000 was approved by a 2 to 1 vote. The similar new grade school issue was defeated soundly. Building commenced and by September of the following year, the doors of the new Valley High School were opened at 8th and Hillside. As a part of schoolboard policy, only first class college-educated teachers were hired. By 1919, the rooms of the new high school were filled. A new junior high school was proposed, approved, and completed by the fall of 1923.\nThe new school was the only bright spot in the otherwise uncertain dreary years of 1922 and 1923. The foundations of the city were shaken by a 22-month-machinist strike at the Rock Island shops. Starting 1922-07-01, 600 workers were idled. The railroad company reacted by bringing replacement workers into town to break the strike. The replacements were mostly Mexican and African-American laborers brought up from Oklahoma by R. C. Hyde, the master mechanic at the shops. For their own protection they lived in boxcars and tiny houses in an area south of Railroad Avenue and west of the main rail yards. The area was dubbed \"Hyde Park\" by the strikers. The resulting hardships suffered by the idled workers led the most desperate to choose between breaking the strike or letting their family starve. It was a time which pitted neighbor against neighbor, tearing at the fabric of the community. Two men shot themselves in desperation before the strike ended.\nAlthough the 1920s was the era of prohibition for the rest of the country, Valley Junction had officially become a dry town in 1915. The '20s were not all doom and gloom for Valley Junction. The businessmen of the community dress in drag for a play called \"The Womenless Wedding\". Simple joys of small town life were reflected in the faces of the children: having a part in the school play, flying the first kite, dressing up for the May Day pageant, or riding in the Fourth of July Parade. The older kids enjoyed the chance to take the trolley to Des Moines for an afternoon of shopping and maybe lunch along the river. The notion of the mobile society was embraced by the youth. A joy ride in a fast jalopy to Greenwood Park for a game of tennis, or off to the country for a picnic mirrored the infatuation America had for the car. The wealthier, older, and more established were not left out either. By purchasing land from the Ashworth family farm, the Des Moines Golf and Country Club left Des Moines in 1923 for a more picturesque setting along the White Pole Road auto trail at 8th Street allowing the High Society of Des Moines a relaxing and rather pleasant drive away from the hussle and bussle of the city for a day of golf in the Valley.  By the close of the decade, however, the picnic was over. The Depression was especially hard for the workers of Valley Junction because the railroads had finished pulling out by 1936, and the Keystone Coal Factory had to close because of flooding in the tunnels.\nBy 1937, only two trains stopped daily; the sagging business climate needed a boost. Members of the commercial club believed the only way to attract new industry would be to change the name of the city. They thought the name \"Valley Junction\" conveyed the image of an old-fashioned and backwards town to prospective employers and residents. The name of \"West Des Moines\" would give it the respectability and prestige the town desperately needed. There was a precedent by way of an editorial in the Valley Junction Express in 1905 that suggested dropping \"Junction\" from the name, but nothing came of it. The opposition feared the change to West Des Moines would cause property owners to be taxed the same as Des Moines. It was also declared as a step toward annexation by Des Moines. A third and final election was held on December 7, 1937.\n\nOn January 1, 1938, the name \"Valley Junction\" was relegated to the past, and the new city of West Des Moines took the first steps to a new identity. Helping to establish this new identity, the most identifiable trait was the suspension of all property taxes between 1936 and 1938. This was due to the profits of the water department. Today the original business district of West Des Moines has been preserved as Historic Valley Junction. It features many locally owned specialty shops and restaurants as well as a weekly farmers' market.\nThough the name was changed, the community's commitment to education was bolstered by funds from the Public Works Administration. Despite the Depression, a new elementary school and the Old Valley Football Stadium were built and dedicated on May 24, 1939, at 8th and Hillside. The venerable Lincoln School was razed in 1938 to make way for the new building. Longfellow was retired in 1939 and then sold in 1940 for $1000. In 1955, West Des Moines Elementary School at Walnut and 6th was renamed \"Nellie Phenix Elementary\" in honor of the former principal.  The late 1930s were very good years in the school's athletic teams, producing memorable names: True, Gavin, Swink, and Sherbo. Charles Swink was a multi-record holder in track and field. His record at the Drake Relays stood for twenty years.\nAn overgrown concrete eyesore on Ashworth Road soon became the musical mecca for the surrounding area on June 6, 1939, when Tom Archer opened the Val Air Ballroom. The site was originally the location of the stillborn Wilson Rubber company factory. Intended to bolster World War I tire production, the end of the war in 1918 left only a large concrete slab. Patrons of the Val Air could dance under a canopy of stars to the melodious sounds of Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and other big bands. The war years brought new vitality to the community without a cost.\nThen and now, flooding frequently dampens, but has not broken the residents' spirits. Unpredictable waters of the Raccoon River and Walnut Creek have often exceeded their banks due to large amounts of rain in the summer and snowmelt in the spring, filling the streets and damaging homes and businesses.\nIn 1950 West Des Moines had a population of 5,615, but the city grew as many new housing subdivisions were built. West Des Moines annexed the neighboring community of Clover Hills in 1950, the town of Ashawa, a former Rock Island railroad stop, in 1957, and the town of Commerce, along the Raccoon River, in 1960. City government also grew, and when the venerable city hall could not keep up with the city's expansion, the city opened a new municipal building in 1954. With the influx of students, the school district's ever-expanding borders continually compromised classroom capacity. Children attended school in former homes near Phenix, with classes in hallways and living rooms. Space was even rented from the new Catholic grade school. In 1959 alone, 150\u2013200 new homes were built, adding to the population's growth. The construction of Interstate 35, Interstate 80, and Interstate 235 in the 1960s brought more people and businesses to West Des Moines. This construction also caused the Des Moines Golf and Country Club to sell its location along Ashworth Road and 8th Street and then move to its current location in Dallas County. In 1966, Dowling Catholic High School/St. Joseph Educational Center purchased 55-acre (22 ha) from the Des Moines Golf and Country Club and, subsequently, moved from Des Moines and opened at its current location, 1400 Buffalo Road, in the fall of 1972. Several retail and office complexes opened along the I-235 corridor after the freeway's completion, including Valley West Mall, which opened in 1975. West Des Moines' population jumped from 11,964 in 1960 to 31,702 in 1990.\nWest Des Moines expanded into Dallas County during the 1990s and 2000s, once again placing the premier golf courses of the Des Moines Golf and Country Club in its city limits and punctuated by the opening of one of the best golf courses in Iowa at the Glen Oaks Country Club along with the West Glen Town Center and the largest in the state of Iowa, Jordan Creek Town Center and shopping mall in 2004. Major commercial construction is underway around the area, including the opening of many additional hotels, shopping centers, and office buildings, including a new Wells Fargo corporate campus. In 2007 construction started on the Village of Ponderosa, an urban-inspired and pedestrian friendly community. In 2005 West Des Moines annexed land in Warren County for the first time. Seeing the land to the south of Des Moines as extremely valuable, especially with the completion of a major \"South-Belt Freeway\" system, the cities of Norwalk and West Des Moines are actively competing for land in the northern part of Warren County. From 1990 to 2015, West Des Moines is the fastest growing city in Iowa according to land mass.\nDuring the 1990s a new city/school campus opened near the intersection of South 35th Street and Mills Civic Parkway. West Des Moines' new police station opened in April 1992. This was followed by the opening of a new public library in 1996; the library served as temporary home for West Des Moines' city hall until a new building was dedicated in late 2002. The campus also features a new stadium for Valley High School that also opened in 2002. On the same property, the West Des Moines School district operates Valley Southwoods, a freshman high school with over 600 students that opened in 1996. Turning the West Des Moines Community Schools into a two high school district was not acceptable. In 2004, August Hillside Elementary opened on the former site of Hillside Junior High and Old Valley Stadium, which was demolished in 2001. In 2012, Clegg Park Elementary was renovated and opened as the new Walnut Creek Campus which is the district's alternative high school. Major renovation and additions were completed at Valley High in 2007 and again in 2015.\n\n\n== Government ==\nWest Des Moines uses the mayor-council form of government with a city manager appointed by the city council. The council consists of the mayor, two at-large members, and three members from each of the city's three wards. The mayor and all council members serve four-year terms. Rick Messerschmidt served as the interim mayor of the city following former mayor Eugene Meyer's resignation in January 2007; On April 17 Steve Gaer was elected mayor during a special election. Tom Hadden is the city manager of West Des Moines.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nWest Des Moines is located at 41\u00b034\u203225\u2033N 93\u00b045\u20321\u2033W (41.573739, \u221293.750359). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 39.48 square miles (102.25 km2), of which 38.59 square miles (99.95 km2) is land and 0.89 square miles (2.31 km2) is water. West Des Moines' location in the Raccoon River valley has left parts of the city, particularly the Valley Junction area, prone to flooding. After the Great Flood of 1993, a floodwall was constructed along Walnut Creek (near the boundary with Des Moines) to protect that area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWest Des Moines has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa).\n\n\n=== Street numbering ===\nWhile nearby Clive, Urbandale, and Windsor Heights use the same street numbers for north-south streets that Des Moines uses, West Des Moines uses its own street numbering system. Thus, 86th Street in Clive and Urbandale becomes 22nd Street in West Des Moines. Iowa Highway 28, which forms most of the boundary between Des Moines and West Des Moines, is 63rd Street in Des Moines but 1st Street in West Des Moines. Many of the east-west streets share the same name with Des Moines, although the numbering of these east-west streets starts over in West Des Moines.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe median income for a household in the city was $54,139, and the median income for a family was $70,600 (in a 2008 estimate, these figures had risen to $61,256 and $83,800 respectively, in 2008 inflation-adjusted dollars). Males had a median income of $45,185 versus $31,555 for females. The per capita income for the city was $31,405. 2.8% of families and 4.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.3% of those under the age of 18 and 3.0% of those 65 and older.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 56,609 people, 24,311 households, and 14,201 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,466.9 inhabitants per square mile (566.4/km2). There were 26,219 housing units at an average density of 679.4 per square mile (262.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 88.4% White, 3.3% African American, 0.2% Native American, 4.8% Asian, 1.5% from other races, and 1.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.2% of the population.\nThere were 24,311 households, of which 30.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.4% were married couples living together, 8.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.4% had a male householder with no wife present, and 41.6% were non-families. 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.32 and the average family size was 2.98.\nThe median age in the city was 33.5 years. 24.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 9.2% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 32.6% were from 25 to 44; 23.4% were from 45 to 64; and 10.6% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.3% male and 51.7% female.\n\n\n=== 2000 census ===\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 46,403 people, 19,826 households, and 11,915 families residing in the city.

        "wiki": "Borisova gradina or Knyaz-Borisova gradina (Bulgarian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 or \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437-\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430, translated as Boris' Garden or Knyaz Boris' Garden) is the oldest and best known park in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Its construction and arrangement began in 1884 and it is named after Bulgarian Tsar Boris III.\nThe history of the garden embraces three periods under three renowned gardeners. All followed the initial scheme, developing it further and perfecting it instead of making radical changes to the original design.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Neff period (1882\u20131906) ===\nIn 1882, the then-mayor of Sofia Ivan Hadzhienov brought Swiss gardener Daniel Neff from Bucharest with the intention to create a garden for the capital of Bulgaria. The mayor's initial plans included first establishing a large nursery where trees, shrubs and flowers for the future garden would grow, also providing material for the already existing gardens and for the streets. \n\nNeff developed the first plan of the garden in the spring of 1882, set up the nursery and built a house for himself, starting construction in 1884. Acacia trees were originally planted, flowerbeds were shaped, a small artificial lake was built and this all was fenced with a hedge of oaks and hawthorns. The nursery produced saplings that met the needs of the city and were also sold to the citizen. Acacia trees were most widely produced together with mulberry trees, trumpet flowers, elm trees, plane trees and others. The nursery was shaped as a garden in 1885 and had an area of 300,000 m\u00b2 in 1886 with four main alleys.\nBorisova gradina grew to the southwest in the following years and the large lake was built in 1889. Knyaz Ferdinand ordered in 1888 the replacement of most acacias with forest oaks, sycamores, ash trees and birches. The next couple of years saw the planting of deciduous trees from neighbouring forests, as well as coniferous ones from Rila, black pines and spruces.\n\n\n=== Frei period (1906\u20131934) ===\nThe Alsatian Joseph Frei was appointed manager of all gardens and parks of Sofia in 1906. He reorganized Borisova gradina according to his own plan further developing the one of Neff. In carrying out this plan Frei planted the two main alleys in the lower part of the garden, the linden and chestnut one, and opened the wide central and two side alleys in the upper part, from the children's playground to the Fish Lake. This period also witnessed the construction of the People's Fountain, later faced with freestone to be named the Freestone Fountain.\n\nWhile Neff was an admirer of acacia trees, Frei had a passion for flowers. He created the Rosarium at the place of removed agricultural buildings, as well as the numerous modern nursery gardens and hothouses. The garden was further extended south of the oak forest to the modern Dragan Tsankov Boulevard. The fruit plantations were gradually replaced with decorative tree and shrub species, pines and spruces, turning the garden into a wonderful park.\n\n\n=== Duhtev period (1934\u20131944) ===\nThe Bulgarian gardener and specialist Georgi Duhtev became the manager of the Gardens and Parks Service in 1934. During his period, the old Rosarium was extended to embrace 7,000 m\u00b2 with over 1,400 new cultivated rose species being planted by him. The Japanese Corner was created in 1940 above the Fish Lake towards Tsarigrad Road. Plants sent by the Japanese minister plenipotentiary were used to arrange it. These plants represented the national flora of Japan and were a gift and a sign of friendship between the Japanese and Bulgarian people.\nAround 1942 Borisova gradina embraced an area of 90,500 m\u00b2, 68,600 m\u00b2 of which planned and 4,400 m\u00b2 not, the remainder of 17,350 m\u00b2 being built up and including the Summer Swimming Bath, the University Observatory, the Open-air School, the Big Lake, the Yunak and Levski football fields, the tennis club, the diplomatic tennis court, the cycling track and the Yunak Rectifying Station.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nThe Borisova Gradina TV Tower was built 1958\u20131959. Borisova gradina was last reconstructed in 1986 under Georgi Radoslavov. It was proclaimed a monument of Bulgarian park and garden art the same year.\n\n\n== Name ==\nAlthough Knyaz Boris became Tsar in 1918, there is no evidence of the park's name ever having officially changed to reflect this fact. Instead (or, perhaps, because of this), the word Knyaz was gradually dropped to become simply Boris's Garden.\nAfter the communist regime took power in 1944, the park was renamed \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430 (Park na Svobodata - \"Freedom Park\"), until its fall in 1989, when it reverted to its original name.\n\n\n== References ==\nHistorical photographs of the Boris' Garden\n\"The gardens of Sofia\" (in Bulgarian).

          "This is the central orthodox church of Sofia. It's beautiful,vast,colorfoul and it's dedicated to Russia who liberated Bulgaria not once but two times in recent history. The only downside is that it could be surrounded by a more idealic scenery and not by cars (it's a garage",
          "After awhile a lot of the churches we saw started to look the same, but the more you look when inside you see the subtle differences. Its worth a step inside as it is a historical part of the city and its history.",
          "As one of Sofia\u2019s key attractions, the cathedral is certainly worth a visit. Note that photography is permitted only if you purchase a photography ticket.",

          "This building is a work of art. I have no words to describe the greatness of this palace. Totally recommend to visit this place!",

          "It is a place to visit while in Sofia. Located on the highest spot, elevation wise, in Sofia. Very near St. Sophia church, the land mark for the ancient Roman travellers. The church is a true representation of the Eastern Europiean religion with frescs and overall architecture.",
          "I visited St. Alexander Nevski Cathedral as part of the 'Free Sofia tour' (which I highly recommend) and it is the last stop so you can go explore after the guides talk on the building. It's an epic lavish building with a more dour interior. If you want to take a photo, do so",

          "Small but impressive cathedral. Beautiful wall decorations. The lighting is stunning and the whole place feels relaxed. I definitely recommend buying a photo pass for 10lev as I took loads and they definitely check that you have a pass.",

          "The first thing I felt walking in was divinity, that's the main reason I would highly recommend visiting and taking the time to sit and absorb the energy. I don't feel words do justice to the experience so you'll have to experience it for yourself \ud83d\ude42. The only issue I was",
          "I loved viewing this Cathedral from both outside - such a large building, but the real beauty was inside. Glad I joined a walking tour and the guide could describe different aspects of the church.",
          "Located in the center of Sofia and a symbol of the Bulgaria capital. Construction began in 1904 and it was completed in 1912. Inside is beautiful with its marble works, mural paintings and over 80 icons made by artists from Bulgaria, Russia and Czech. There is a crypt located in",

          "Although it\u2019s not old the church is very nice, built in typical orthodox style. Interior is interesting, but not traditional and beautiful as in other Bulgarian churches.

          "when you walk into the cathedral you're faced with a large open space no rows of chairs and three small altars lots of candle burning it has a unique atmosphere even if you're not religious it has an emotional toll on you you can buy a medal as a keepsake I spent 2 hours there",
          "Astonishing cathedral build in the late 19th century worth visiting. If you would like and if you\u2019re a faith person you can go inside and light a candle completely free (of course you have to buy the candle). Inside there is a church shop where you can buy whatever souvenirs",

          "When you think of Sophia, you will remember Alexander Nevski Cathedral. It is iconic, and located in the heart of lovely Sophia. Walk all around the Cathedral to admire the wonderful architecture and get some great photos. It is difficult to get a picture with you in front",
          "Nice from outside, the interiors is not worth visiting. It is rather dark inside, so you can hardly see the paintings on the walls, which are nothing special and farkend by candle smoke anyway. Beware of fraud! There is no hint in English that you need a photo license. If you",

          "This is one of Sofia\u2019s most iconic buildings and well worth a visit. It\u2019s very grand inside but the frescoes are fairly dull and not so easy to see high up. Staff are vigilant for people taking pics and will challenge you - and charge 10lev for the privilege.",
          "This Memorial Church is an impressive landmark in Sofia. I enjoyed walking all around it, and the inside is amazing. Pity that a part of it was under construction an not allowed for visitors",

          "Must see in Sofia. If you are doing the free walking tour I suggest it as your starting point for a deeper visit since it's the ending point of the tour. Inside it's a bit dark and to admire the art it's not very easy. The fact that you have to pay to make photos and videos it's",

          "It's a cathedral in an open land. I watched inside and turned around outside. Pretty nice place to visit.",
          "It is a stunning building and stunning inside. I think it is closed on a Monday. You can just go in and see it with no charge as should I say ALL churches should be...FREE.",
          "Our walking tour ended right outside here so we went in for a look. It\u2019s impressive from the outside, classically Orthodox, but inside didn\u2019t have the same grandeur or appeal. Worth a look, but don\u2019t plan your trip around this cathedral.",
          "This cathedral has the wow factor as you walk towards it. Definitely a must see if you are exploring Sofia. Unfortunately we were unable to go inside today.",

          "Gorgeous cathedral, took loads of photos from the outside. We went in the morning and it was pretty quiet so don\u2019t worry about any crowds. The inside is really beautiful too but they don\u2019t let you take any photos inside without paying something like \u00a310. Some man chases you",

          "The exterior of this beautiful church should be enjoyed by taking a walk around the perimeter. The interior is richly painted and there are many brass lighting chandeliers although many of the bulbs are burned out and many of the chandlers are switched off. The low light makes",
          "Best place in ....................Sofia. We visited on a business trip. Our guide was knowledgeable and gave a insight into history of the building . A lovely place a few benches to sit but mostly open to wander round and admire frescos. It is quite dark inside during the week",

It is named in honour",

          "Nice church but not the prettiest I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s very dark so you can\u2019t see the interior paintings very well. Also don\u2019t take pictures unless you want to pay 20 Lina. They will make you pay if they see you even if you didn\u2019t know! Prettier exterior than interior",

          "Stunning church both isndie and out. A bit dissapointed with the weather when we visited (rain) otherwise the views outside would have been even better. Inside was amazing, so opena nd vast and seeing all the paraphanalia of an Orthodox Church was impressive. Only downside was",
          "Its an impressive monument. Very big and cold inside.Location is good. Surroundings are nice too. Clean and well maintained",
          "A glorious, large and very beautiful church. Really worth to be the most well known of the city. You might want to not that the crypt is more like a museum than a crypt, with extra admission ticket.",

          "The cathedral is extremely impressive both in size and quality of the detail. Towering above you it is a sight to behold. Nowadays it shows signs of neglect as it has not had a major claen-up and renovation over its 100 years. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church, having finally",

          "We came here the day before the papal visit. Highly Recommend the iconic art museum in the crypt. Take pictures of the main cathedral. I preferred the quieter corners for solice.",
          "The outside is impressive in itself, the inside you have to pay 10 lev to take pictures, but worth it as it is one of the grandest orthodox churches. It is interesting being a (western christian) to see the difference between the churches layout. If you have a guide that can",
          "An impressive Cathedral. It\u2019s scale inside somehow doesn\u2019t match up though. But worth a visit. It won\u2019t take long to look round so don\u2019t plan to be there for the afternoon. Although the surrounding area has lots to offer. It\u2019s worth seeing it at night as well",

It is located between Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard to the north, Knyaz Alexander Battenberg Street to the west and Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko Street to the south, in the historical centre of the city.\nOriginally arranged in the last years of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, it was radically transformed immediately after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 and the choice of Sofia as the capital the following year under the city architect Anton\u00edn Kol\u00e1\u0159 on the initiative of the temporary governor Pyotr Alabin. The alley network was reorganized, new plants were added, as well as a low wooden fence, a coffeehouse and a kiosk for musicians. The garden was initially named the Alexander II Garden in honour of Russian tsar Alexander II, who initiated the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, which led to the Liberation of Bulgaria.\nUntil the end of the 19th century the City Garden was repeatedly reorganized and further developed. Among the noted gardeners that worked on it were Karl Betz, Daniel Neff and Iliya Todorov, who shaped the garden's appearance that it would retain until the Second World War.\nThe construction of the now-demolished Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum soon after the beginning of Communist rule of Bulgaria after the war was followed by multiple fundamental reorganizations, such as in 1951 and 1959 by Sugarev and R. Robev, 1976 and 1978 by A. Agura. These led to the orientation of the garden not towards the former royal palace as previously, but towards the Ivan Vazov National Theatre. The new composition was often in conflict with the initial planning and the City Garden lost territory and key architectural elements in the period.\nToday the City Garden is not only a popular retreat for the residents of the capital, but also a favoured place for amateur chess players, who can be regularly seen in the small garden in front of the National Theatre. It was also the place where a group of around 300 people gathered on 27 August 1895 to climb Cherni vrah in Vitosha led by the writer Aleko Konstantinov on what is regarded as the birth date of tourism in Bulgaria.\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistorical photographs of the City Garden in Sofia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Palace of Culture (Russian: \u0414\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b, romanized: dvorets kultury, Chinese: \u6587\u5316\u5bab, w\u00e9nhu\u00e0 g\u014dng) or House of Culture (dom kultury) was the name for major club-houses in the Soviet Union and the rest of the Eastern bloc. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIt was an establishment for all kinds of recreational activities and hobbies: sports, collecting, arts, etc.; the Palace of Culture was designed to have room for multiple uses. A typical Palace contained one or several cinema halls, concert hall(s), dance studios (folk dance, ballet, ballroom dance), various do-it-yourself hobby groups, amateur-radio groups, amateur-theatre studios, amateur musical studios and bands, lectoriums (lecture halls), and many more. Groups were also subdivided by age of participants, from children to retirees. A public library may sometimes have been housed in the Palace of Culture as well.  All hobby groups were free of charge until most recent times, when many hobbies with less official recognition were housed based on \"self-repayment\". A Palace of Culture was sometimes called a \"club\", but this did not mean that it was membership-based.\nIn official rhetoric, all these were supposed to aid the \"cultural leisure\" of Soviet workers and children and to fight \"cultureless leisure\", such as drinking and hooliganism.\nPalaces or Houses of Culture were introduced in the early days of the Soviet Union, inheriting the role that was earlier fulfilled by so-called \"People's Houses\". Below is an excerpt from John Dewey's Impressions of Soviet Russia and the revolutionary world (1929).\n\nThe other impression I would record came from a non-official visit to a House of Popular Culture.  Here was a fine new building in the factory quarter, surrounded by recreation grounds, provided with one large theater, four smaller assembly halls, fifty rooms for club meetings, recreation and games, headquarters for trade unions, costing two million dollars, frequented daily\u2014or rather, nightly\u2014by five thousand persons as a daily average.  Built and controlled, perhaps, by the government?  No, but by the voluntary efforts of the trade unions, who tax themselves two percent of their wages to afford their collective life these facilities.  The House is staffed and managed by its own elected officers.  The contrast with the comparative inactivity of our own working men and with the quasi-philanthropic quality of similar enterprises in my own country left a painful impression.  It is true that this House\u2014there is already another similar one in Leningrad\u2014has no intrinsic and necessary connection with communistic theory and practice. The like of it might exist in any large modern industrial center.  But there is the fact that the like of it does not exist in the other and more highly developed industrial centers.  There it is in Leningrad, as it is not there in Chicago or New York...\n\nThere were two basic categories of Palaces of Culture: those owned by the state and those owned by the  enterprise. Every town, kolkhoz and sovkhoz had a central Palace or House of Culture. Major industrial enterprises had their own Palaces of Culture, managed by the corresponding trade unions. \nPalaces of Culture served another important purpose: they housed local congresses and conferences of the regional divisions of the Communist Party, the Komsomol, etc.\nIn smaller rural settlements similar establishments of lesser scope were known as \"clubs\", with main activities there being dance nights and cinema. \nIn 1988 there were over 137,000 club establishments in the Soviet Union.\nIn the People's Republic of China, the best-known, and most centrally located, Palace of Culture is perhaps the \"Workers' Palace of Culture\" located in the former Imperial Ancestral Temple just outside the Forbidden City in Beijing.\nThe concept and the name of a \"House of Culture\" also appears in (for example) France (Maison de la culture), Belgium and Quebec.\n\n\n== Post-Soviet times ==\nMost Palaces of Culture continue to exist after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but their status, especially the financial one, changed significantly, for various reasons.\n\n\n== List of palaces of Culture ==\n\nPalace of Culture of Tirana (Albania)\nNational Palace of Culture (Sofia, Bulgaria)\nPalace of Culture and Science (Warsaw, Poland)\nPalace of Culture (Ia\u0219i) (Romania)\nPalace of Culture (T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219) (Romania)\nGorbunov Palace of Culture (Moscow, Russia)\nCultural Palace of Nationalities (Beijing, China)\nPalacio de Cultura Banamex (Mexico City, Mexico)\nPalace of Culture (Palacio de la Cultura) in Managua, Nicaragua\nPalace of Culture Energetik (abandoned Palace in Pripyat, Ukraine)\nKominkan (Japanese equaivalent)\n\n\n== Other Soviet entertainment complexes (Dvorets) ==\nPalace of Sports\nPalace of Arts and Creativity, a variation of Palace of Culture (i.e. Tolyatti Palace of Arts and Creativity, Palace of Arts \"Ukraina\")\nPioneers Palace (House of Young Pioneers)\nHouse of the Red Army (DKA)\nHouse of Military Officers\nPalace of the Soviets (special case)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCultural center\nInstitute of Culture\nPeople's House, previous term that existed in the Russian Empire\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Our guide book was pretty dismissive of this building, which does appear a little brutal from the outside. But it's worth going in (it's free) and wandering up to the higher floors for some fantastic views. The architecture inside is modern, but grand, and there's a warm and",

          "Admittedly, the sheer size and Soviet-style intimidation of this building are impressive. However, I went both days and couldn't get inside (a Friday late afternoon and a Saturday mid day). The cafes on the ground level were open but the building doors were locked. The park",

          "It seems as though I lucked into visiting on the right weekend. There was a small parade of children in traditional dress on their way to a stage setup outside the NPC. Once there they performed many dances. Sadly we had to leave before we could see all the different countries",

        "wiki": "The history of Sofia, Bulgaria's capital and largest city, spans thousands of years from Antiquity to modern times, during which the city has been a commercial, industrial, cultural and economic centre in its region and the Balkans.\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\n\nSofia was inhabited since at least the 30th millennium BC. A neolithic settlement around the National Art Gallery is traced to the 3rd\u20134th millennium BC.The earliest tribes who settled were the Thracian Tilataei. In the 500s BC, the area became part of a Thracian union, the Odrysian kingdom. \nIn 339 BC Philip II of Macedon destroyed and ravaged the town.The Celtic tribe Serdi gave their name to the city. The earliest mention of the city comes from an Athenian inscription from the 1st century BC, attesting Astiu ton Serdon, i.e. city of the Serdi. A local inscription and Dio Cassius recorded that the Roman general Crassus subdued the Serdi and beheaded the captives.Around 29 BC, Sofia was conquered by the Romans.It gradually became the most important Roman city of the region and became a municipium, or centre of an administrative region, during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98-117) and was renamed Ulpia Serdica. \nThe city was burnt and destroyed in 170 by the Costoboci and the city was rebuilt, this time with its first defensive walls between 176-180 under Marcus Aurelius as evidenced by inscriptions above the gates.\nThe city expanded again, as public baths, administrative and cult buildings, a civic basilica and a large theatre, were built. When Emperor Diocletian divided the province of Dacia into Dacia Ripensis (on the banks of the Danube) and Dacia Mediterranea, Serdica became the capital of the latter. \nRoman emperors Aurelian (215\u2013275) and Galerius (260\u2013311) were born in Serdica.\nIn 268 a Gothic raid ravaged and burned parts of the city including the theatre which was abandoned.The city continued to expand and became a significant political and economical centre, more so as it became one of the first Roman cities where Christianity was recognised as an official religion (under Galerius). An amphitheatre was built over the remains of the theatre under Diocletian (284\u2013305) and later under Constantine the Great (306\u2013337).\nThe Edict of Toleration was issued in 311 in Serdica by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity. The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of \"religio licita\", a worship recognized and accepted by the Roman Empire. It was the first edict legalising Christianity, preceding the Edict of Milan by two years. Moreover, in the Edict of Milan, only one sentence was dropped: \u201cNe quid contra disciplinam agent.\u201d So the Edict of Milan preached unconditional religious tolerance where the Edict of Serdica stated a conditional tolerance (meaning of disciplinam here is: unless they, the christians, disturb the good or social order of the State). \nFor Constantine the Great it was 'Sardica mea Roma est' (Serdica is my Rome). He considered making Serdica the capital of the Byzantine Empire instead of Constantinople.The Tetrarchs' and Constantine's efforts to secure a large supply network for the Danube army by building a large number of horrea in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries appears to have included Serdica as a principal gathering base due to the 8 horrea discovered by excavation.In 343, the Council of Sardica was held in a church located where the current 6th century Church of Saint Sofia was later built.\nThe city was destroyed by the Huns in 447, but was rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th century and was renamed Triaditsa. Serdica again flourished during the reign of Justinian I, when its defensive walls were reinforced by doubling their thickness and adding more towers, and whose remnants can still be seen today. \nAlthough also often destroyed by the Slavs, the town remained under Byzantine dominion until 809.\n\n\n=== Archaeology ===\n\nMany remains of the ancient city have been excavated and are on public display today. These include:\n\nComplex Ancient Serdica\neastern gate\nwestern gate\ncity walls\nthermal baths\nbridge over the river (near the Lion's bridge)\n4th c. church of St. George Rotunda\namphitheatre of Serdica\nthe tombs and basilicas under the basilica of St. SophiaUnder Constantine the city expanded to the north of the walls (the so-called Northern Appendix) and the Roman bridge over the river became an important part of this area.\nA set of no less than 8 horrea (warehouses) were found inside the southwestern quarter of the walls and dated to the early 4th century indicate tha Serdica was probably a supply-centre of regional importance, connected to the Danube by the valley of the river Iskur (Oescus).\n\n\n== Middle Ages ==\nSofia first became part of the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Krum in 809. Afterwards, it was known by the Bulgarian name Sredets and grew into an important fortress and administrative centre.\n\nAfter a number of unsuccessful sieges, the city fell again to the Byzantine Empire in 1018. In 1128, Sredets suffered a Magyar raid as part of the Byzantine Empire, but in 1191 was once again incorporated into the restored Bulgarian Empire at the time of Tsar Ivan Asen I after the Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion.\nFrom the 12th to the 14th century, Sofia was a thriving centre of trade and crafts. It was renamed Sofia in 1376 after the Church of St Sophia. However, it was called both \"Sofia\" and \"Sredets\" until the 16th century, when the new name gradually replaced the old one.\nDuring the whole of the Middle Ages, Sofia remained known for its goldsmithing, particularly aided by the wealth of mineral resources in the neighbouring mountains. This is evidenced by the number of gold treasures excavated from the period and even from Antiquity.\n\n\n== Ottoman period ==\n\nIn 1385 Sofia was besieged and conquered by the Ottoman Empire during the reign of Murad I. Ottoman subjects from Anatolia joined the predominantly Bulgarian-speaking population during that time. Sofia saw the 1443 crusade of John Hunyadi and W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Varna, a desperate effort to drive out the Ottomans. The crusade failed and many residents of Sofia were persecuted for their participation, particularly those from the elite classes. Afterwards Sofia became the capital of the beylerbeylik of Rumelia, the province that administered the Ottoman lands in the Balkans. During that time Sofia was the largest import-export base in modern-day Bulgaria for the caravan trade with the Republic of Ragusa.\n\nWith a significant growth in population, many Ottoman buildings emerged during the 15th and 16th centuries onwards. Few of them are preserved today, including only a single functioning mosque, Banya Bashi. During the period however, we see great diversity as well as public investments in infrastructure, education and the local economy. Amongst others the sources mention eight Friday Mosques, three public libraries, numerous schools, 12 churches, three synagogues, and the largest bedesten of the Balkans.The tax registers of the 16th century witness a significant rise in the Muslim population at the expense of Bulgarian-speaking Orthodox Christians: there were 915 Muslim and 317 Christian households in 1524\u20131525, 1325 Muslim, 173 Christian and 88 Jewish in 1544\u20131545, 892 Muslim, 386 Christian, 126 Jewish and 49 Romani in 1570\u20131571, as well as 1017 Muslim, 257 Christian, 127 Jewish and 38 Roma households in 1573. \n\nAs already mentioned, Ottoman rule brought major demographic growth for Sofia. As the city became a centre of commercial activity, it grew from a total population of 6,000 (1620s) through 55,000 (middle 17th century) to 70-80,000 (18th century). This data from foreign travellers is most possibly exaggerated, but still shows the significance of Sofia during these times. \nDuring the 16th century, Sofia was a thriving trade centre inhabited by Bulgarians, Romaniote, Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Greeks and Ragusan merchants. In the 17th century, the city's population even included Albanians and Persians. At the end of the Ottoman occupation, the city had a population of 20,501, of whom 56% were Bulgarian, 30% Jewish, 7% Turkish and 6% Roma.\nIn 1610 the Vatican established the Bishopric of Sofia for Ottoman subjects belonging to the Catholic millet in Rumelia, which existed until 1715 when most Catholics had emigrated to Habsburg or Tsarist territories.\n\n\n== 19th and 20th centuries ==\nSofia was seized by Russian forces in 1878, during the Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78, and became the capital of the autonomous Principality of Bulgaria in 1879, which became the Kingdom of Bulgaria in 1908.\n\nMost mosques in Sofia perished in that war, seven of them destroyed in one night in December 1878 when a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers. Following the war, the great majority of the Muslim population left Sofia.In 1907 the Monument to the Tsar Liberator was inaugurated on Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard in Sofia.\nIn 1925, the gravest act of terrorism in Bulgarian history, the St Nedelya Church assault, was carried out by the Bulgarian Communist Party, claiming the lives of 150 and injuring other 500.\n\nDuring World War II, Sofia was bombed by Allied aircraft in late 1943 and early 1944, as well as later occupied by the Soviet Union. Bulgaria's regime which allied the country with Nazi Germany was overthrown and Sofia became capital of the Communist-ruled People's Republic of Bulgaria (1946\u20131989).\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of Sofia history\nSerdi\nFirst Bulgarian Empire\nSecond Bulgarian Empire\nAncient Roman architecture\nEdict of Serdica\nList of oldest church buildings\nList of the oldest buildings in Sofia\nHistory of Bulgaria\nArchitecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School\nPrincipality of Bulgaria\nKingdom of Bulgaria\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Sources and references ==\n\nGigova, Irina. \"The City and the Nation: Sofia\u2019s Trajectory from Glory to Rubble in WWII,\" Journal of Urban History, March 2011, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp 155-175; the 110 footnotes provide a guide to the literature on the city\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

          "This museum offers a nice way to spend about an hour learning about the city. Don't expect too much interactivity, which is the case in most museums in Sofia, but still it is quite nice. Not too special but quite fun",
          "The museum gives some interesting insights on old Sofia citizens' lives - there are a lot of costumes, furniture, household objects exhibit. You can also learn how old Sofia settlement is - the history goes back to the first people that have lived in the area. Museum's building",
          "We have been to quite a few city museums and this one wasn\u2019t the best but not the worst either. There is information in English which is great but it\u2019s quite small, they could have a lot more there. The staff were very unapproachable and one lady shouted at me in Bulgarian, I",

          "This museum is well worth a visit for a couple of hours if you\u2019re after a brief introduction to the history of the city. It\u2019s good value for money for what it is but don\u2019t expect an in depth museum with lots of exhibitions. There is also a limited amount of written information",
          "To be honest, this place was a disappointment. The ticket I paid for, was +2 lev extra, from the pricing at the wall. And I did not get any explanation, why so, even asking. Exhibition itself was small. Upper rooms were mostly empty and under construction/renewal/something",
          "I have been there 2 times fogether with my family and friends. In sofia only here you can see these special items from old Sofia including carriage, old wagon, shoes, toys and clothes. Must visit it. I love this place.",

          "Being a city with a very rich history, Sofia can show many facts and views to everybody. The collection of this museum puts together in a short way all this knowledge. Extremely good way to understand Sofia as a city and history. The tickets for retired are 2 leva only.",
          "A very attractive building which hosts the most well kept museum in all of Sofia. Lots of informative videos with English subtitles and some impressive exhibits. Unfortunately photos inside cost 15 lv which to my mind is extortionate. The lady manning the ticket booth was lovely",
          "The building this museum is housed in is beautiful. For us, that's where the enchantment ended; the ticket lady was rude and dismissive, and the price not cheap. The collections inside are lacklustre and only slightly interesting. We were chased out of one room by a woman",
          "This is the newest museum in Sofia, which offers a good summary about the history of the capital of Bulgaria in an interactive way. Located in the beautiful building of the former public baths (1928) it makes your visit authentic. I recommend you to include the museum in your",

          "The museum is well laid out and really interesting to walk around and learn more about the history of the city up to the post war era. at 8lev per person it is a bargain. - watch out if you want to take photos they charge you! Highly recommend a visit located just behind the",
          "This was a fantastic museum! Well worth a visit, there is so many to take in from many different time periods. We spent quite a while in all of the different rooms. Only small complaint is that there is no real order to the layout and it is a little confusing. Do not be put off",
          "After visiting the central market we wandered over to the museum and decided to go inside. We were quite happy we did. There are permanent exhibitions detailing the history of Sofia and a temporary exhibition that displays the finds from the latest season of archeological digs",
          "A really magnificent building let down by a lack of order. Whilst there was English on most cases, there was no story being told; or chronology to help you out. Did not even know it was an old bath house until reading other reviews on here. So it could probably do with a little",

          "This is housed in the former bath houses and so I expected some history about the bath house itself but there was no information. There was one room where you could see the way the baths were but this wasn't pointed out and was used for other information. In terms of the",
          "At \u00a33 per visitor it's well worth a walk around and you can also taste the water from the springs outside, apparently one spring is good for your heart and the other is good for your stomach. Warning, you cannot takes bags inside but they do provide a free locker that you can",
          "There are lots of artifacts but there are only so many dresses and things you can look at. Yes, it tells you what they are in English but it would have been good to learn about what the significance of everything was. Also nothing about the ordinary people of Sofia, just lots",

          "I am mystified by comments this is an \"OMG you must see this\" museum. Have these people never been to amazing museums before?! TBH it's just ok. The best exhibit is on the ground floor, presenting the very early pre-Roman and Roman history of Sofia and some medieval iconography.",
          "This museum and the Archaeology Museum were my two favorites on our recent trip. Housed in what was formerly the mineral baths, it offers an excellent insight into the history of Sofia. Artifacts are interesting and relevant, displays are nicely done, most interpretation",

          "This museum is now fully open and it is well worth the trek out of town. It is possible to cut through the Borisova Park, itself a worthwhile diversion, to avoid the worst of the busy roads and to see some Soviet era monuments. Outside the museum are dozens of tanks, artillery",
          "Not so musch a review as a warning a the museum is closed from August 9th till the start of September (4 or 9, nor sure, please call to check). A note on the gate and entrance had the dates on it, but I couldn't read well through my tears... The gate to the outdoor exhibit was",

          "This superb museum is a reason in itself to visit Sofia although some way from the centre of town. There are some good bars within walking distance. The massive display of Soviet planes, tanks, armoured vehicles and missiles is stunning and I feel would not be seen in Western",
          "worth to be seen not for the military mahines in the garden, but because of the large collections of Fine art pictures telling the Bularian history, the collection of medals, and unique collection of guns , good for children to spend all day long there",
          "Make sure that you have time to visit this museum If you like military history, it's a large museum. It is located close to a shopping mall (Serdika Center), if someone of the family or friends want to so something different during your visit at the museum. The shopping mall",

          "As an aviation enthusiast and lover of history, this museum scratched all my itches. The displays vary in terms of quality of upkeep, with quite a few looking somewhat beaten up, but to me this was the distinctive attraction of the outdoor museum. If you're interested in Cold",

          "Loads of stuff in here friendly staff my partner loved all the Soviet planes and tanks outside but we don't have any photos due to a notice saying no photos outside at this time which was a shame. You can get up real close to the planes ,and tanks outside which is great to see",
          "Very educational museum, runs through two thousand plus years of history. I've studied history all my life, and retired from the military and learned a great deal during the visit. The outside displays are increadble and the four floors of indoor displays are as well. Get used",
          "This museum is rather far from downtown and not easy to find; Yet it definitely deserves a visit because you will be able to see an amazing collection of engines, weapons and other warfare from the soviet times. Impressive",

          "So this place really has it all. You can learn about the history of Bulgaria, the uprising in the world wars and true accounts from people. Not just that but there are military vehicles you can touch and look in awe at how incredible they are. Slightly gutted you were not",
          "I loved this military museum just seeing tanks, helicopters and plans out in all there glory from WW2 onwards. You could get a real sense of scale and terror from each vehicle. Particlar highlights are the hind helicopter and tiger tanks. The best bits are outside. There is an",
          "Two huge fields full of MiGs, tanks and missile launchers going back to WWI? I think so! Unbelievable opportunity to see history right up close. Inside is first class as well: multimedia section on Bulgaria in WW2, plus original uniforms, medals and arms from earlier wars. Two",
          "We visited here with my 5 year old son and his grandfather, and all enjoyed it. You can get up close to lots of military machines in the outside areas, such as tanks, MIG fighter jets and ballistic missiles - great for children. Inside there are interesting historical",

          "If you want to know the history (as perceived by an Eastern European country especially the Balkans) go to their Military History museum. This one is one of the best I have visited. In fact this was the second visit.",

          "This is a large museum about a 20 minute walk from central Sofia. It has a large collection of tanks, artillery, aircraft and other military vehicles outside on the property. Some of them I have never seen before. The museum itself has three floors of the chronological history",

          "If you have at least 2-hours, visit this Museum. Both outdoors and indoors will eat your time easily. Overwhelmingly Rich selection of anything military you can think of from 19-20th centuries related to the turbulent Balkan history. Surprisingly we saw many paintings - like",
          "I have visited many museums in Bulgaria, and I think this is the best of the lot. There is large outdoor display of military hardware which is all well labelled in Bulgarian and English (if a little time-worn in places). The kids will love all these items as much as the adults -",

          "This museum is not near most of the other sights, but it is worth the short trip. They have an extensive outdoor collection of tanks, planes, and other large military equipment. Inside is mostly art and artifacts from WWI and various other Bulgarian conflicts.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. I couldn't give it 5 stars for two reasons. First, the lady at the ticket counter spoke exactly zero English, which is no problem until you have a question. I wanted to know about the audioguide so I tried pointing to the \"English audio guide: 2 lv\"",

          "This museum is well out of the way from the center of the city and took me about 50 mins to walk to from Vitosha Boulevard. The museum is comprised of two buildings set in large grounds. Around the building there are dozens of tanks, missiles, planes and assorted military",

          "Great well maintained museum which is a gem for those that love military (and all) history. The museum walks the visitor through the history of Bulgaria from ancient times to modern day and shows the associated military equipment from the period. Would definitely like to visit",
          "Although Bulgaria is small this museum contains good collection of weapons that were part of Bulgaria's army history. The museum is excellent for families with kids even girls. You can spend there 1-2 hrs or if you want to can certainly spend more (but probably without kids)",
          "I visited the museum in 4th April this year. It impressed me very much - the building is modern, all facilities are modern, the exposition halls are spacious. There is much to be learnt and seen from the expositions. I strongky recommend visiting that museum, you'll not be",

          "In my opinion, Boyana Church is the only other attraction that is as much worth seeing as this museum. It has a great range of military equipment from WWII and later - both Soviet and German. This museum should appeal to both military equipment enthusiasts (the courtyards are",

          "I was quite disappointed with the museums in Bulgaria. This one was a clear exception. In this well-taken-care-of museum I was (finally) able to get a glance on Bulgaria's History. Mainly due to its permanent conflicts. Rich in objects, details, explanations and even in fake",
          "Very nice place to visit with kids. Many tanks, vehicles and more. We spent good and interesting time there...",
          "I went there with some friends, they have a free area, that you can see and touch the 2nd world war tanks and aircraft without paying a penny. But also they have several expositions inside totally worth the money ~8 BGN per person. They have really cool and interesting machinery",
          "Great place for military lovers, especially the outside exhibition - you can see there almost every piece of military equipment that was used in the BG army, including ballistic missiles and jet fighters. The inside exhibition is also wonderful , showing all moments of our 1300+",
          "Easy 30 min walk from tourist area of Sofia and neighborhoods seem safe to walk through. Easy to navigate to from the Russian Army monument. Outside has tanks, planes and artillery from various years. Inside doesn't have the level of detail normally associated with a military",

          "Quite a nicely done museum in a dingy little neighborhood, but very well done. Sufficient English signage to make the history and displays come alive, and do a wonderful job of telling the history of Bulgaria. A large amount of military memorabilia, both inside and out. What",

          "A really good collection, I'm not that into military history but found the planes, missiles, helicopters, tanks etc very interesting, and there's plenty of information provided about each one. Kids were climbing on the planes though so made it difficult to get decent photos, but",
          "I normally am not a fan of Military museums but this one sprang out. The ammount of vehicles displayed of the former Easter side is astonising. But this is not all, this is the free part, the paying part (8 lev for the first 3 and an extra 2 lev for the fourth floor) is worth to",

          "Approaching this place is amazing as you first see the planes, tanks and military vehicles which are \u2018parked\u2019 near the entrance.  You really get the impression that someone has phoned the Ministry of Defence and asked for any spare \u2026",
          "Great exhibits, both outdoor and indoor, on both ancient and more recent history. English translation is provided for most of the exhibits, although they could improve on the quality of the translation.",
          "Great museum to visit. A lot of things to see are available as well as plenty of information connected to them. If someone is interested and truly curious about history, also has the opportunity to hire a guide.",
          "One of the best Museum I've ever seen. Too much cool stuff and very cheap. An absolute must for war equipment enthusiasts",
          "One of the best museums in Bulgaria. Many interesting exponats, perfectly maintained, well described storyline, neat and clean in both the outside and the indoor museum areas. Last time I visited it 10 years ago, and its pretty renovated and expanded since then.",
          "A lot of interesting exhibits to see and the outer yard is free to visit.",
          "They did a really great job with this museum. Definitely entertaining and educational at the same time. Thanks !",
          "Great collections spanning centuries of history from ancient times to the present day.\nThe exhibits in the outdoors area are in poor shape.",
          "Fantastic museum. Their collection of artefacts is without compare. Do buy the ticket which allows access to the top floor, the weapons collection is incredible. I\u2019ve never seen so many pieces collected in one space. The outside park has a \u2026",
          "Interesting. For a western tourist seeing all these Russian military equipment was indeed interesting. Learned and observed a lot.",
          "Best exhibits I've ever seen! Recommend it for everyone!!",

          "Pretty cool museum. Quite a lot to see. Better calculate some time!",
          "Very interesting museum. Great pieces of military vehicles, planes, guns etc. on the outside space. In the building you can see the Bulgarian military history since the ancient times.",
          "Great variety of tanks, planes, guns and missiles in the gardens. 4 floors of Bulgarian history with a great arsenal on the 3rd and 4th floors. Some bits are only in Bulgarian.",
          "Great place for a military history buff. The free side is great. The paid part is primarily USSR planes, trucks and tanks but very cool. Well worth the 4 Euro to get in.",
          "Authentic machines in the front and back yard. Inside of the building there is huge museum with different periods and wars in Bulgaria. Really interesting place to be.",
          "Interesting collection, ticket system a little odd with vouchers?",
          "I would give 5 stars, but there are no English translations. I cannot understand how a museum can not have those in 2019!\n\nIn the outside is a lot of war machinery, in the inside more about the soldiers, the wars in general and history.\n\nThey have an original enigma coding machine. Wow!",
          "A wide arrange of large military vehicles. Tanks planes rocket launchers and supporting vehicles. Cool to see. Only the museum displays inside do not have any English translations. That is too bad. Therefore 3 starts instead of 4.",
          "Amazing collection of Soviet and NATO military hardware unmatched anywhere I\u2019ve been. Collection includes land, sea and air units from as recently as the early 00s. Informative and well put together exhibition also provides the history and context. Really worth a visit.",
          "Awesome place.\nI don't know any other place where you can touch missile mounts on a Mil24 or Mig28 and look into cockpits.\nMy girlfriend translating all signs did help :-)",
          "A must museum to visit in Sofia. A huge variety of military trucks, tanks, helicopters, aircrafts of various periods of time. Free entrance on the outside and 8 leva per person for the 3 floor building. The fourth floor is an extra 3 leva \u2026",
          "It's a really nice place. The entrance fee is low and you get to see not only war machines but you can also learn a lot about Bulgarian history . There is a building inside the park- museum that shows a lot of artifacts about Bulgarian \u2026",
          "One of the most spectacular museums I've ever seen, it is simply overwhelming through it's richness of information. After more than 4 hours spent there I decided to just take pictures of the rest of the artifacts and study the pictures at \u2026",
          "Amazing place with professional staff and great exhibitions. The military history of Bulgaria is presented very objectively. Every time I visit I find there a new interesting exhibition and exciting surprises for the tourists. It stands out amongst the museums in Sofia.",
          "This year they made it quite attractive with one of the army brass orchestras and some traditional army meal. There was supposed to be a chance to get into a Mi-8 transport chopper, but I couldn't make it to it. Overall the exhibition is quite big and diverse.",
          "If you love history or want to know more about Bulgarian war history and military this place is for you. Incredible artefacts, paintings, machines and etc.",
          "Probaly the closest you'll get to this type of military technology, also this museum has the famous bulgarian bayonet painting in it.",
          "Worthy place to go, number 1 place to go in Sofia. Placed all the retired tanks, fighter air crafts, choppers. Amazing.",
          "Beautiful artifacts, weapons and tanks . The only fault I found was that some of the exhibits were in Bulgarian with no English translation",
          "Great place. You can learn a lot about Bulgarian history. There is park area which is free.",
          "A very interesting museum. It is missing a substantial part of the Bulgarian history, though. I mean the partisan warfare 1941-1944.",
          "Free parking, easy access, not much to see but enough for the kids to wow",
          "Excellent! So much to see from through the ages",
          "This is very interesting museum with huge collection of war exponates. I can totally recommend this for visit to anyone who stay in Sofia.",
          "The museum is absolutely awesome. Try to dedicate at least 2 hours to see everything. There are special dates that the entry is free, which gives the opportunity for everyone to see it. Even the normal fee is very cheap for such a nice museum in my opinion.",
          "The best place in sofia. I learned cost of war.",
          "Very nice place to visit especially with your childrens.. Family ticket cost 10 Leva except the last floor of the museum.. The last floor cost 4 Leva per person.. And there is a free parking area inside the museum..",
          "A unique place to visit.  The exhibits in the museum reflect the history of Bulgaria, the original of the Samara flag, the hair of Vasil Levski and many other unique exhibits are preserved here.  In the courtyard of the museum there is a \u2026",
          "I liked this place very much, just make sure you visit it in the right time because it closes early.",
          "Fantastic museum from ww1 to modern nato war machines everything you want is at here",
          "A must see museum for everyone that likes planes, rockets, tanks and other military equipment.",

          "The museum is quite boring, the garden with military equipment is not though!",
          "Great exhibition with a lot of items from all across Bulgarian history.",
          "A nice 4 plane museum, with a really beautiful garden with old tanks and fighter jets, also some big rocket launchers. The building begins with the oldest history at the first plane and further up to plane 3. I recommend visiting the forth \u2026",
          "An awesome space to learn about history and bring your kids to see the wartime exhibition.",
          "Good but not very convenient in terms of working hours",
          "Nice place, if you like the free part before the entrance, then you should enter. It is a huge collection, not everything is English but without the audioguide we could follow the complete Bulgarian history. The audio guide would only add \u2026",
          "If you are in Sofia and you have not gone to this museum I highly recommend you to do it. If you are interested in history and military equipment, you will surely like it. I have gone several times. The first time I was quite small, and then I was very impressed.",
          "Loads to see, you can get right up to the exhibits and have a good look at them. Unfortunately some are left to leak oil or have flat tyres, some TLC wouldn't go a miss. But a great day non the less",
          "My opinion is .. weapon museums are not a good inspiration for our children specially when you see them at an open public space...",
          "Good place to walk around and touch  some oldish military hardware. The museum exposition itself is nothing exceptional and I would like it to be ordered a bit better. As Bulgarian I know most of the history presented, but even I am a bit \u2026",
          "Very interesting museum, worth it to be visited",
          "A lot of historical vehicles, canones and militaria.",
          "Good to see there is so much outside that you can see for free.\nWell worth the couple quid to get inside to see more.",
          "One of the best museums in Sofia!",
          "Probably the best museum in Sofia. Of a grand scale with many different things to look at all with comprehensive descriptions. The tanks/helicopters/planes etc are very interesting. Only thing I would say is that there is absolutely nowhere \u2026",
          "One of the best military museums I visited so far! So many beats airplanes and vehicles in the garden. \nUnfortunately payment is only possible cash and with Bulgarian Lev.",
          "It's really interesting and cool; however, they need to maintain the vehicles a little bit more.",
          "Huge. Well organized, giving enough information that I understood everything, despite the fact that I knew absolutely nothing about Bulgarian history before my visit. They, very wisely, focus on the artifacts rather than text. Even the \u2026",
          "The part outside has some cool machines and is for free",
          "Assorted tanks, artillery pieces and a few combat aircraft since the 1930s and throughout the Cold War. T-34 and some German panzers avalable, but I did not see any Acht-Acht. Great photo-ops. A bit shabbier history exhibition. Look up topical exhibitions which happen once per a blue moon, such as medals and orders.",
          "It's one of the best museums you can visit in Sofia. It has a big park of old military machines and has one relatively large building. When I visited the museum on 22 of September there was an ongoing exhibition with a lot of interactive stuff.",
          "Staff wasn't very friendly and didn't speak English. Nevertheless its worth visiting the museum.",
          "Amazing stuff and amazing place. Totally worth the visit.",
          "This museum is one of a kind. The war machinery that is exhibited at the outside-areas are partly bearthtaking (and discomforting, of course). However, the information signs simply state technical facts and not what was so important about \u2026",
          "You can learn many things",
          "Informative museum, which becomes very special if you can visit it on a guided tour.",
          "Fantastic. Really enjoyed my visit here. Not busy. Great outdoor display of Soviet planes and other hardware. If you like military museums you'll like this one.",
          "Great place to learn about military history starting from ancient times and moving on to the 18th century, balkan war, ww1 and ww2. A good exhibition of ww2 to vietnam war era weapons on the 4th floor. Some interesting tank specimens \u2026",
          "Random but fun. A lot of military things to see and the museum gives some interesting Bulgarian historical context. Kids will love all the planes and tanks.",

          "It is very cool because it have tanks and old military staff.",
          "Very static, almost no English. Good just if you like to observe old objects or you speak Bulgarian",
          "Massive amount of old military vehicles. You get to see a lot for free but there is an even greater selection if you pay. We'll worth a visit.",
          "Incredible place",

          "This is the best museum in the Bulgarian capital. Must see. The location is in the downtown. The exposition is perfect. Great!",
          "Renovated and perfect for a family day off. Children, especially boys would be very excited to see all the planes, tanks, bulldozers, etc.",
          "Nice museum, small but with some geams",
          "Nice collection of military hardware outside, although some of it is in rather poor shape. Interesting exhibits inside. Most things are labeled in both Bulgarian and English, which was nice.",
          "War machines everywhere. Most of them from the soviet army.",
          "Lots of jets, canons, warvehicle's outside. Museum gives a nice overview of the regional (war) history. Some chambers (the ones with all the medals, uniforms for example) are a bit over the top.",
          "Big museum. Very interesting expositions.",
          "Military museum.  Nice exposition .",
          "Really interesting museum with very fine exhibition and a huge yard with all kinds of military equipment.",

          "A great range of exhibitions from a wide range of military history. I visited here on my last day in Sofia, and spent about 2-3 hours for a very modest fee. There's a lot to learn from the internal exhibitions about Bulgarian history that you may not necessarily find out elsewhere, and everything was presented well.",
          "Great place to learn about Bulgarian history. Very informative, you cannot miss it.",
          "The regular exhibition is rich. There are very interesting military vehicles and aircrafts in the courtyard. Also, the museum organises temporary exhibitions and events. Some of these events are related to national holidays when the entrance is usually free and it gets a bit overcrowded.",
          "If you're into planes and tanks this is one of the best places to see them up close and in detail",
          "For me the highlight of this place was the gigantic view of war vehicles, airplains missiles and much more (which is also free). Inside you can get a ticket to see more cool weapons and history of bulgarian wars, it was quite interesting.",

          "Huge place, many thematically arranged expositions. At least 2-3 hours of time to check it out. At least. The outside yard is full of different t war machines, dating from different centuries and WW 1 or WW 2 armies. There are monthly and \u2026",

          "for fanatics history is the best",
          "Seriously, it was amazing. The museum let us see, take photos, and even touch things that we in normal museums would pay to do. There were tanks, fighter jets, missiles, armored personnel carriers, amphibious personnel carriers, \u2026",

Odd.",

        "wiki": "The history of Sofia, Bulgaria's capital and largest city, spans thousands of years from Antiquity to modern times, during which the city has been a commercial, industrial, cultural and economic centre in its region and the Balkans.\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\n\nSofia was inhabited since at least the 30th millennium BC. A neolithic settlement around the National Art Gallery is traced to the 3rd\u20134th millennium BC.The earliest tribes who settled were the Thracian Tilataei. In the 500s BC, the area became part of a Thracian union, the Odrysian kingdom. \nIn 339 BC Philip II of Macedon destroyed and ravaged the town.The Celtic tribe Serdi gave their name to the city. The earliest mention of the city comes from an Athenian inscription from the 1st century BC, attesting Astiu ton Serdon, i.e. city of the Serdi. A local inscription and Dio Cassius recorded that the Roman general Crassus subdued the Serdi and beheaded the captives.Around 29 BC, Sofia was conquered by the Romans.It gradually became the most important Roman city of the region and became a municipium, or centre of an administrative region, during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98-117) and was renamed Ulpia Serdica. \nThe city was burnt and destroyed in 170 by the Costoboci and the city was rebuilt, this time with its first defensive walls between 176-180 under Marcus Aurelius as evidenced by inscriptions above the gates.\nThe city expanded again, as public baths, administrative and cult buildings, a civic basilica and a large theatre, were built. When Emperor Diocletian divided the province of Dacia into Dacia Ripensis (on the banks of the Danube) and Dacia Mediterranea, Serdica became the capital of the latter. \nRoman emperors Aurelian (215\u2013275) and Galerius (260\u2013311) were born in Serdica.\nIn 268 a Gothic raid ravaged and burned parts of the city including the theatre which was abandoned.The city continued to expand and became a significant political and economical centre, more so as it became one of the first Roman cities where Christianity was recognised as an official religion (under Galerius). An amphitheatre was built over the remains of the theatre under Diocletian (284\u2013305) and later under Constantine the Great (306\u2013337).\nThe Edict of Toleration was issued in 311 in Serdica by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity. The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of \"religio licita\", a worship recognized and accepted by the Roman Empire. It was the first edict legalising Christianity, preceding the Edict of Milan by two years. Moreover, in the Edict of Milan, only one sentence was dropped: \u201cNe quid contra disciplinam agent.\u201d So the Edict of Milan preached unconditional religious tolerance where the Edict of Serdica stated a conditional tolerance (meaning of disciplinam here is: unless they, the christians, disturb the good or social order of the State). \nFor Constantine the Great it was 'Sardica mea Roma est' (Serdica is my Rome). He considered making Serdica the capital of the Byzantine Empire instead of Constantinople.The Tetrarchs' and Constantine's efforts to secure a large supply network for the Danube army by building a large number of horrea in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries appears to have included Serdica as a principal gathering base due to the 8 horrea discovered by excavation.In 343, the Council of Sardica was held in a church located where the current 6th century Church of Saint Sofia was later built.\nThe city was destroyed by the Huns in 447, but was rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th century and was renamed Triaditsa. Serdica again flourished during the reign of Justinian I, when its defensive walls were reinforced by doubling their thickness and adding more towers, and whose remnants can still be seen today. \nAlthough also often destroyed by the Slavs, the town remained under Byzantine dominion until 809.\n\n\n=== Archaeology ===\n\nMany remains of the ancient city have been excavated and are on public display today. These include:\n\nComplex Ancient Serdica\neastern gate\nwestern gate\ncity walls\nthermal baths\nbridge over the river (near the Lion's bridge)\n4th c. church of St. George Rotunda\namphitheatre of Serdica\nthe tombs and basilicas under the basilica of St. SophiaUnder Constantine the city expanded to the north of the walls (the so-called Northern Appendix) and the Roman bridge over the river became an important part of this area.\nA set of no less than 8 horrea (warehouses) were found inside the southwestern quarter of the walls and dated to the early 4th century indicate tha Serdica was probably a supply-centre of regional importance, connected to the Danube by the valley of the river Iskur (Oescus).\n\n\n== Middle Ages ==\nSofia first became part of the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Krum in 809. Afterwards, it was known by the Bulgarian name Sredets and grew into an important fortress and administrative centre.\n\nAfter a number of unsuccessful sieges, the city fell again to the Byzantine Empire in 1018. In 1128, Sredets suffered a Magyar raid as part of the Byzantine Empire, but in 1191 was once again incorporated into the restored Bulgarian Empire at the time of Tsar Ivan Asen I after the Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion.\nFrom the 12th to the 14th century, Sofia was a thriving centre of trade and crafts. It was renamed Sofia in 1376 after the Church of St Sophia. However, it was called both \"Sofia\" and \"Sredets\" until the 16th century, when the new name gradually replaced the old one.\nDuring the whole of the Middle Ages, Sofia remained known for its goldsmithing, particularly aided by the wealth of mineral resources in the neighbouring mountains. This is evidenced by the number of gold treasures excavated from the period and even from Antiquity.\n\n\n== Ottoman period ==\n\nIn 1385 Sofia was besieged and conquered by the Ottoman Empire during the reign of Murad I. Ottoman subjects from Anatolia joined the predominantly Bulgarian-speaking population during that time. Sofia saw the 1443 crusade of John Hunyadi and W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Varna, a desperate effort to drive out the Ottomans. The crusade failed and many residents of Sofia were persecuted for their participation, particularly those from the elite classes. Afterwards Sofia became the capital of the beylerbeylik of Rumelia, the province that administered the Ottoman lands in the Balkans. During that time Sofia was the largest import-export base in modern-day Bulgaria for the caravan trade with the Republic of Ragusa.\n\nWith a significant growth in population, many Ottoman buildings emerged during the 15th and 16th centuries onwards. Few of them are preserved today, including only a single functioning mosque, Banya Bashi. During the period however, we see great diversity as well as public investments in infrastructure, education and the local economy. Amongst others the sources mention eight Friday Mosques, three public libraries, numerous schools, 12 churches, three synagogues, and the largest bedesten of the Balkans.The tax registers of the 16th century witness a significant rise in the Muslim population at the expense of Bulgarian-speaking Orthodox Christians: there were 915 Muslim and 317 Christian households in 1524\u20131525, 1325 Muslim, 173 Christian and 88 Jewish in 1544\u20131545, 892 Muslim, 386 Christian, 126 Jewish and 49 Romani in 1570\u20131571, as well as 1017 Muslim, 257 Christian, 127 Jewish and 38 Roma households in 1573. \n\nAs already mentioned, Ottoman rule brought major demographic growth for Sofia. As the city became a centre of commercial activity, it grew from a total population of 6,000 (1620s) through 55,000 (middle 17th century) to 70-80,000 (18th century). This data from foreign travellers is most possibly exaggerated, but still shows the significance of Sofia during these times. \nDuring the 16th century, Sofia was a thriving trade centre inhabited by Bulgarians, Romaniote, Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Greeks and Ragusan merchants. In the 17th century, the city's population even included Albanians and Persians. At the end of the Ottoman occupation, the city had a population of 20,501, of whom 56% were Bulgarian, 30% Jewish, 7% Turkish and 6% Roma.\nIn 1610 the Vatican established the Bishopric of Sofia for Ottoman subjects belonging to the Catholic millet in Rumelia, which existed until 1715 when most Catholics had emigrated to Habsburg or Tsarist territories.\n\n\n== 19th and 20th centuries ==\nSofia was seized by Russian forces in 1878, during the Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78, and became the capital of the autonomous Principality of Bulgaria in 1879, which became the Kingdom of Bulgaria in 1908.\n\nMost mosques in Sofia perished in that war, seven of them destroyed in one night in December 1878 when a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers. Following the war, the great majority of the Muslim population left Sofia.In 1907 the Monument to the Tsar Liberator was inaugurated on Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard in Sofia.\nIn 1925, the gravest act of terrorism in Bulgarian history, the St Nedelya Church assault, was carried out by the Bulgarian Communist Party, claiming the lives of 150 and injuring other 500.\n\nDuring World War II, Sofia was bombed by Allied aircraft in late 1943 and early 1944, as well as later occupied by the Soviet Union. Bulgaria's regime which allied the country with Nazi Germany was overthrown and Sofia became capital of the Communist-ruled People's Republic of Bulgaria (1946\u20131989).\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of Sofia history\nSerdi\nFirst Bulgarian Empire\nSecond Bulgarian Empire\nAncient Roman architecture\nEdict of Serdica\nList of oldest church buildings\nList of the oldest buildings in Sofia\nHistory of Bulgaria\nArchitecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School\nPrincipality of Bulgaria\nKingdom of Bulgaria\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Sources and references ==\n\nGigova, Irina. \"The City and the Nation: Sofia\u2019s Trajectory from Glory to Rubble in WWII,\" Journal of Urban History, March 2011, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp 155-175; the 110 footnotes provide a guide to the literature on the city\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

          "Nice selection of artwork and displays in a very impressive former Communist building but needs some maintenance on the outside.",
          "You will be stunned by the gold treasure exhibited in this museum. It's incredible that you're allowed to be a few inches of the glass case highlighting Thracian treasure from around 1,000 B.C. It's not a large exhibit but it is jaw-dropping, to be sure. Various rooms have",
          "FANTASTIC!! My husband and I visited this museum yesterday and we would both have to give this a 5 star rating. Yes, it is a little way outside of city center, but it is MORE than worth the small price of the taxi there,(\u20ac5/6) too lazy to get bus! and the small admission fee.",
          "The building is clearly of Russian design during the communist times. Seen many like it. However it was not originally designed as a museum and the elaborate marble staircases as enter indicate that. Nevertheless is a worthwhile place to visit. As I had a tour guide with me it",
          "If like me you are lacking knowledge of Bulgarian History this is the place to visit, we were blown away by the array of artefacts covering around 7000 years. The numerous examples of Thracian craftsmanship especially the gold pieces are an absolute joy to behold. The museum is",

It\u2019s Brutalism at its best from the communist era which to me always looks a little sci fi. Like a foreboding",

          "The National Historical Museum (NIM - Natsionalen Istoricheski Muzei) is the largest museum in Bulgaria. NIM was established in 1973. The collections of NIM include more than 650,000 cultural monuments. All this is a good reason for everyone to visit it on a mandatory basis!",
          "This is another national treasure. Displays are very well done and the building is an architectural beauty. It's actually walk-able (about 20 minutes) from the Ottawa side via the pedestrian walkway on the Alexandra Bridge.",

          "There is so much to see here. It is on the outskirts of the city, but you can catch a tram to it, or ask your hotel to order a taxi there (it should cost 6 to 10 Lev) and then ask the reception desk at the museum to call you a taxi back to central Sofia. Entrance fee is 10",
          "There are a lot of exhibits from many different epochs. We did not have the time to do them all justice. What we saw was quite impressive and memorable. There is room to improve the curation and descriptive information of the exhibits.",

          "Just south of the city, the Museum is the ex-palace of the former Communist leader of Bulgaria. The building itself is a fantastic piece of design, with huge carved wooden interior doors, an impressive series of marble staircases, and a display of some unique and outstanding",
          "I'm local so I have visited the museum multiple times. Make sure you see the Thracian hall \u2013 it will certainly take your breath away! The ethnographic floor is also very good with lots of exhibits to admire. Going there is a bit tricky so in case you are a foreigner you might",
          "Last Monday of the month the entrance is free. Former presidental palace - impressive architecture. We wandered around for more than an hour and admired the gold and silver thracian goblets, folk art, icons and a history of female underwear. Nice caf\u00e9. There are some busses",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. Beware little English spoken. Displays sometimes in English. Lovely little caf\u00e9 selling drinks and ice creams",

          "This vast structure stands alone in a sprawling green with a backdrop of the mountain, a metal gate with a long walk up to the museum entrance. The inside is equally dramatic. I don't know which I was impressed with, the building with its ornate wood carving ceilings and",

          "Oh my goodness this place is a wonder to behold. It is situated outside of all the main attractions and could so easily be missed but it is a gem. Once the royal palace I believe the building harks back to roman architecture, If you ignore the exhibits you would enjoy visiting",

          "The building is amazing itself, a relic of the Communist era. The wood joinery and cdecoration is amazing. There is a good coverage of Pre 20th century Bulgaria back to ancient times. Most was explained in English . I dont recall which other languages. we spent a few hours",

          "Let's start with the building. This building was formerly the Presidential Palace during the Communist era, and it is a true 1960s Brutalist wonder made of reinforced concrete. The interior also has some fascinating 1960s touches such as numerous spangly chandeliers, broad",

          "Even though it's old and most of the times it miss some life in it, it has the typical construction of the Socialist era and it has a beautiful big hall. The History of Bulgaria is all in here, since the Stone Age until the dictatorship era. A good surprise and a good lesson of",
          "This museum was wonderful with its many and varied exhibits. It also was surprisingly easy to get to by public transport. Ask at your hotel which tram to take and then go to the end of the line.....you will know you are there because the tram pulls into a roundabout across",

          "The building may look less inviting from the outside but once in, the well organised exhibitions will take the visitor through a huge time span of regional history - pre-dating the current state and people - and is easy to digest. We had a guide who helped us to pick the",

          "To be honest, in all it's soviet architectural weirdness the building is actually kind of pretty. And it houses an exhibition that is more insightfull then we expected. With highlighting parts of the Bulgarian past we didn't get from the books. It is certainly worth a visit.",
          "I enjoyed visiting this museum which provided an abundance of information about Bulgaria. There is so much to this country than I realized. It is definitely worth visiting.",
          "In this Museum you can learn a lot of about the Bulgarian history during the whole period of the country constitution. A lot of documents, pictures, explanations show the visitors the Bulgarian history in details.",
          "Some of the artefacts in this museum are really world class. Really exquisite worked gold from the Thracian kingdom - marvel at how they did this 2000 years ago!",
          "This museum was a little out of the way, but totally worth walking through. It has an extensive ancient Thracian collection, which was put together in a nice flowing way. I loved it!",
          "Situated about 10km from town, it is worth making a trip by taxi to see some interesting displays of ancient Bulgaria particularly the precious gold objects from approx 3500B.C. Had not appreciated that Bulgaria used to cover such a large area in former times. However the",
          "Do not use the google map directions from trip advisor unless you like driving in circles until you disappear up your own anus",
          "The collection is amazing and well organized. I had waited to see it because it was outside of the centre a bit but you should not wait or skip it. This will tell you as much about the long and rich history of Bulgaria as any place in the country.",
          "This museum is a little out of the way - its not in central sofia but a very short (and cheap) taxi ride away and is definitely worth the trip! The museum is a soviet era building and is impressively large with nice grounds. The exhibits are mainly of prehistoric items found",
          "Although, I knew I would not have time for the museum, I wanted to see Boyana Residence of Thodor Zhivkov (former communist head of state of Bulgaria). I took the trolley bus #2 to the last stop which is across from the building. It was an interesting ride, however took a very",
          "If you're able to get over the brutalist facade and the 1970's luxe interior, you'll find a fascinating museum covering much of Bulgaria's history. Beyond the Thracian treasures, you'll also find a fascinating history of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, and its struggle under",
          "The museum is quite rich and has a good lighting. You can see lots of artefacts from Antiquity and the two medieval Bulgarian Tsardoms. The museum is in the building of Bulgarian Communist leaders' former residence which is interesting in itself. A setback is the slightly",
          "We visited the museum expecting a mix of modern and ancient history. The ancient history was very well covered and explained, however there was not a lot on the Ottoman Empire and modern / last hundred years which really explains where Bulgaria is today. You could learn more",
          "The chaotic history of Bulgaria is beautifully laid out so that the visitor learns the defining elements of Bulgaria's invading cultures. Pagan, Greek, Roman, European, Ottoman and current stories of the Thracian peoples emerge in modern Bulgaria.",
          "The museum had no credit card system. We only had euros and they refused to allow us entrance, in spite of repeatedly requesting them to grant us access with Euros. The ticket agent slammed the door on our face! Great way of introducing tourists to your history and culture",
          "If you are an archaeologist/historian (as we are), you must visit this museum, but the Soviet-style totalitarian architecture and 200-meter approach (for us, in 38-degree sun), is rather dehumanizing.",
          "This museum is so big, it has nice collection of monuments. The history and the archeology is awesome.",
          "This museum is located in the Boyana district. It was an 11 lev cab ride from our central Sofia hotel. The museum is located in a former Communist party meeting hall and it was interesting to experience its faded opulence. The displays are interesting, but leave out huge",
          "The star is the building, being the old home of the communist era leaders. It is 1960/70s glam. The layout of the museum on the main floor is good and the prehistoric and Thracian / Hellenic / early Byzantine rooms are fine but after this it gets confusing with no real narrative",
          "I visited the museum officially with our state delegation team. It was a comfortable afternoon...the museum co director narrated us about different antics displays. Later we had a memorable photo session at the back of the museum keeping Vitosha mountain at the back.",
          "The museum is relatively small. Do not try compare it with Louvre though. The collection I must say is a bit limited. But if you happen to visit Sofia, and have a spare time, why not?",
          "This is full of really interesting stuff - especially icons. As interesting is the massively ambitious communist building it is housed in, which is now quietly crumbling around the artefacts. Simple outside cafe with a great view when you want a break.",
          "The museum is housed in the last Communist leaders (Todor Zhikov) state home.It displays extremely impressive ancient artifacts especially from the Thracians. Dont miss the Panagyurishte Treasure. I paid a taxi driver 15 euros to go to here and the Boyana monastery.",
          "A very soviet looking building, not far from sofia centre but that requires a car. split into three floors gives to the non educated people like myself a quite clear image of bulgaria. all very neat and quite. very few visitors i have to say (bliis). as in many other places i",

          "Easily accessible by trolleybus, the building and exhibits are equally compelling. The building was formerly the presidential palace, and the scale inside and out is breathtaking: huge chandeliers and marble-clad cavernous halls. The courtyard is lined with Roman statues.",
          "Many people don't realize but Bulgaria has over 3,000 years of recorded history and a lot of those artifacts are displayed in the National Museum. Not to miss are the ancient Thracian treasures - the Thracian kings (living in the time of Ancient Greece) believed that they can",

          "Every time when I have guests or collegues from othe countries I bring them here. Without exception, all of them like very much the visit because they learn a lot about the rich Bulgarian history. The treasure of the Thraces are her and a lot of unique pieces. The guides speak",
          "We visited this museum on someone's recommendation and we're glad we did. It told us, in English, all about the Ottoman empire and how Sofia had developed over the years. Very interesting and well worth a visit.",
          "There are some interesting things to see at this museum. It's not a large collection but it is fairly varied. I reallly liked the building itself as well as the grounds",
          "Even if you have to take a taxi to get there and back (no public transit) it is worth every penny. The Thracian gold dating to time of Egypt pharaohs is absolutely spectacular. the exhibits are very well done and easy to navigate.",
          "On the outskirts of Sophia, the building looks a little drab from the outside. Once inside the floors are wide and take you logically through time for the country's history. Good explanations of how the wars and religion etc have shaped the modern day Bulgaria. Some quite",
          "It is a good museum that can give sufficient understanding to a foreign visitor about Bulgaria's impressive history. By coincidence I also met the Museum's director who is an impressive person himself and likes to talk with visitors. The downside, I found the location suitable",
          "This is a great museum, with impressive architecture that covers all aspects of Bulgarian history from early settlers until the accession into the EU. Spacious and well put together, many displays are in English. It is a bit of a trek out from the city centre. We tried using",
          "It was not what i expected. An English guide would of been needed as not all had english writing. If I had one i am sure it would of changed alot",
          "Spent several hours wandering around the well laid out exhibits that had some English plaques alongside the Bulgarian. The Thracian gold exhibit was particularly exquisite. The cafe area was outside in a nice landscaped courtyard & gardens, nestling at the foot of The Vitosha",
          "Very rich collection of historical items, definitely worth the visit. The museum is placed in old communistic building which adds additional charm, especially for Western European visitors.",
          "It is the most modern vision historical museum in Bulgaria with a large open air park with hundreds of military staff parked there which could be explored by your children in safe. Inside the museum you have a special room for children- 3-6 years old where they could learn",
          "Our private guide who took us around Bulgaria started with the National History Museum and we are so glad he did. He used it to give us a complete context about that which we would visit over the next week. The Museum is very well laid out with a wonderful historical",
          "You can find the whole history of Bulgaria at this fantastic place-from prehistoric times till nowadays.",
          "Everything you could want to learn about Thrace, Soviets, pottery, WWI, WWII - modern Bulgaria is here. Well laid out. Peasant costumes and ancient craft discoveries are worth the admission. Minimum 3 hard museum hours. Close by to Boyana",
          "Museum is located in a suburb of Sofia in a communist builing. The have nice masterpieces there but explanation for somebody who doesnt speak Bulgarian and wasnt living in Bulgaria is poor. More maps needed. The section about the 19 and 20 century is not presented properly to",
          "The museum is housed in a Soviet-era government residence. It is very well appointed with excellent lighting and display cases. One of the most interesting displays is a partial excavation of an ancient Thracian, which they have left intact with adornments and all. Fantastic",
          "In the area of Boyana, it is not far from the church and a practical visit on the way back from Rila. There are many things to discover from ancient Thracians to more recent kings. Lots of space, well lit, it was nice. The tough part was the guardians who chased us constantly",
          "I enjoyed a very short visit to this museum as the exhibits are few but form a record of the past from excavated items. I was a bit confused about the images in the paintings. They were religious but the faces seem to be of Europeans and not from the east as they should be ie",
          "The museum building is Stalinist brutalism. There are some impressive artefacts and displays but the whole museum is let down by a lack of labelling. Even the Bulgarian seems sparse and erratic.",
          "The most interesting part for us was the building and the garden, which give you an impression of the liveof the communist leaders. The exhibition itself is a little from everything. There is not really a thread concerning what they are showing.",
          "I was here for a reception and could only see a small part of the collection - but that part did not explain much and was not that interesting to me. The surroundings and the building are worth the visit though- and take a guide to explain.",
          "The museum of National History in Sofia in BOyana district is full of treasures and you can enjoy a lot!",

          "The museum gives a good insight into the rich Bulgarian history. Most parts have the explanations in English, but not all of them. There is a huge and wonderful collection of the great Bulgarian traditional costumes. It's far from the city centre, but easy to reach by",
          "I was interested in knowing the origins of slavic and bulgarian people and the history of this wonderful land, environmental rich, so I went there and was very useful, I advice you to hire a tour guide (we were lucky with a wonderful one) they charge 30 LEVA for the guide. Njoy,",
          "I went to Sofia to visit the biggest historical museum in my country Bulgaria. As a \"history-lover\" I expected something more exciting. The building is huge and the interior is very beautiful, each hall is with a specific design. It is really impressive to visit the museum but I",
          "When you arrive you are reminded instantly of the Russian heritage. It starts with the beautiful communist era building up against the mountain. An old school mi24 helicopter is on display in the front. It's still in pretty good shape. Just think it needs some fuel and a pilot",
          "For everyone who is interested in Bulgarian history, this is the place. Amazing expositions. Moreover, the last floor offers genuine requisits from Bulgarian movies, which was extremely interesting.",
          "It's a good place to learn a little about Bulgaria and see quite a few historical pieces. Depending on how much you want to see it could take a few hours to see all of it. The building is very nice and offers a nice view of Vitosha mountain",
          "For one side, I felt good that there were few tourists in the National museum of History from Sofia, so my husband and I could see the collection without fighting for space. On the other hand, I felt sorry to see that such a nice collection was not that much visited. The Museum",
          "A regular place for nation building, that is, for presenting the history of the country as one want visitors to see it. That aside, Bulgaria has a fascinating history. I particularly enjoy the part called the Stancioff Family Collection, which tells the story of this great",
          "it was really interesting to find out that Bulgaria has the oldest golden treasure ever found , made by a tribe called Traki. There was a pretty good presentation about it",
          "The building and location of museum are stunning but it is pretty out of the way for Sofia. The exhibits are pretty bare bones and very little information is presented in English. Not the best museum in Sofia.",
          "Very good exposition of cultural and historical heritage, I would recommended this place for everybody",
          "The national museum of history is situated somehow outside the city center and you'd better take a taxi (6-7 leva from the center) to arrive there. But, it's totally worth the visit. I've been there several times with the kids, always booking a guide with us. The exhibitions are",
          "Situated on the outskirts of town (a 7 lev taxi ride from city centre) and an admission of 10 lev . A trip through time from Romans to royal families.. A good way to spend a few hours in the shade of the mountains with lovely forest areas too",

          "Wonderfully clean, surprisingly big and a vast collection of well preserved artifacts from ancient Bulgaria to contempory and near modern exibits. Everything is well preserved and most descriptions are written in both Bulgarian as well as English. I am not typically impressed",
          "This place covers almost the whole Bulgarian history, it is rich of artifacts from different eras with sufficient English explanation written on wall banners, the hall of the traditional clothes ( located on the 3rd floor) was very exciting, what's not good on the visit that",

          "They have moved part of the exhibition of Thracian gold to another museum. The place in mainly interesting for the architecture. It used to be Todor Zhivkov 's (the communist dictator) residence.",
          "What a building, it more reminded me to a palace than a museum. Absolutely stunning. Good place to learn about bulgarian history. Top tip: the coffee place at the back of the museum is a brilliant place to be on a sunny day!",

          "A great place to learn about Bulgarian history. They have artifacts from pre Roman times to the modern era. They also admit the historical mistakes they made during the Balkan wars and the two world wars.",
          "From the gold artifacts of the Thracians, thru all of the turmoil of history with borders shifting all the way into Russia for a time. At the crossroads between Europe, Greece and Asia (Turkey) Bulgaria has many stories to tell. It was great to see that the 500 years ruled by",
          "The mesuem is situated in a spaceous green park and has big collection showing the history of Bulgaria from ancient times. You can combine visit to the museum with visit to one of the oldest churchies : a tiny Boyana church with bestiful frescs. The beautiful garden with great",

          "We were here on a tour so can't comment on how difficult the museum is to get to on your own. We were also only here for a short time but wished we could have spent more time as I feel we only touched on a small sample of what the museum had to offer. The displays are excellent,",
          "If you have time do visit this museum, even though it is not in the centre and therefore a little bit more difficult to get to. I think it is wonderful - open and airy, plenty of different exhibits of Bulgarian history, from national costumes to religious artefacts to a short",
          "The span of history is covered in one building. The early christain church mosaics, the Roman and Thracian treasures. The landscaping behind the building, the avenue of sarcophagi lining the road to the entrance. An absolute must. no entry fee, unless taking photos (10lev) and",
          "This museum is the palace of the former communist ruler located just on the outskirt of Sofia. There are three major halls of exhibition on two floors displaying historical artifects from three different eras.",
          "It has great exhibits and there is often some guest collection. Very impressive rooms, taking visitors through the history of Bulgaria. My only wish is they had a better gift shop :)",
          "We made an unscheduled pit stop at the National Museum in order to see the Thracian exhibit. The Thracian gold items are out of this world in particular the gold drinking horns and the horse and chariot earring. However what we did not expect to find was that the museum",
          "This museum is a must for history and archaeology students. Situated on the ring road just along from IKEA. Fascinating insight into the country by various galleries , right up to World War Two. Photography is permitted with permit from the ticket office for 5lev, entry 10 lev ,",

        "wiki": "The Boyana Church (Bulgarian: \u0411\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u044a\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430, Boyanska ts\u0103rkva) is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church situated on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, in the Boyana quarter. In 1979, the building was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nThe east wing of the two-storey church was originally constructed in the late 10th or early 11th century, then the central wing was added in the 13th century under the Second Bulgarian Empire, the whole building being finished with a further expansion to the west in the middle of the 19th century. A total of 89 scenes with 240 human images are depicted on the walls of the church.\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\n\nThe Boyana Church was built in three stages: in the late 10th to early 11th, the mid-13th, and the mid-19th centuries. The oldest section (the eastern church) is a small one-apse cross-vaulted church with inbuilt cruciform supports. It was built in the late 10th or the early 11th century.\nThe second section, which adjoins the eastern church, was commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Desislava in the mid-13th century. This building belongs to the two-floor tomb-church type. It consists of a ground-floor family sepulchre with a semi-cylindrical vault and two arcosolia on the north and south walls, and of an upper-floor family chapel identical in design to the eastern church. The exterior is decorated with ceramic ornaments.\nThe last section was built with donations from the local community in the mid-19th century.\nThe church was closed to the public in 1954 in order to be conserved and restored. It was only partially reopened in 2006.\nAs a protection measure, air-conditioning was installed to keep the temperature at 17\u201318 degrees Celsius (62\u201364 Fahrenheit), with  low-heat lighting. Groups of up to 8 visitors are permitted to stay for 10 minutes. The building, placed under the management of the National Historical Museum (Bulgaria), was fully reopened to the public by Culture Minister Stefan Danailov on October 2, 2008.\n\n\n== Frescoes ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nBesides the first layer of 11th\u201312th-century frescoes, of which only fragments are preserved, and the famous second layer of murals from 1259, the church also has a smaller number of later frescoes from the 14th and 16th\u201317th centuries, as well as from 1882. The frescoes were restored and cleaned in 1912\u20131915 by an Austrian and a Bulgarian specialist, and again in 1934 and 1944.\nThe church owes its world fame mainly to its frescoes from 1259. They form a second layer over the paintings from earlier centuries and represent one of the most complete and well-preserved monuments of mediaeval art in the Balkans.\nEighteen scenes in the narthex depict the life of Saint Nicholas. The painter here drew certain aspects of contemporary lifestyle. In The Miracle at Sea, the ship and the sailors' hats recall the Venetian fleet. The portraits of the patrons of the church \u2014 Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, as well as those of Bulgarian tsar Constantine Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina, are thought to be among the most impressive and lifelike frescoes in the church, and are located on the north wall of the church.\n\n\n=== First layer ===\nThe first layer of frescoes, which originally covered the entire eastern church, dates from the 11th\u201312th century. Fragments of those frescoes have been preserved in the lower parts of the apse and the north wall, and in the upper part of the west wall and the south vault.\n\n\n=== Second layer ===\nAccording to the donor\u2019s inscription on the north wall of the second section, the second layer of frescoes dates from 1259. Those frescoes were painted over the earlier layer by a team of unknown artists, who also decorated the two floors of the building commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan.\nThe Boyana Church owes its world fame above all to the frescoes from 1259, which demonstrate the exceptional achievements of mediaeval Bulgarian culture. The majority of the more than 240 figures depicted here display individuality, remarkable psychological insight and vitality. The frescoes follow the canon of icon-painting established by the Seventh Ecumenical Council held in Nicaea in 787.\nThe frescoes in the oldest section of the church include a magnificent representation of Christ Pantocrator in the dome. The drum below shows a host of angels, with the Four Evangelists \u2013 Matthew, Mark, Luke and John \u2013 portrayed in the pendentives. Four images of Christ adorn the face of the arches: Christ Emmanuel; Christ, The Ancient of Days; and the acheiropoietic (\u201cmade without hands\u201d) Holy Mandylion and Holy Tile. Next come scenes from the Major Feast Days and the Passions of Christ. Among the full-length portrayals of saints in the first tier, there are ten warrior saints. The Virgin Enthroned, surrounded by archangels, is represented in the altar conch. Below are four church fathers: St. Gregory the Theologian, Basil the Great, John Chrysostom and Patriarch Germanus. The frescoes flanking the altar show the deacons Laurentius, Euplius and Stephen, as well as St. Nicholas, the patron of the ground floor of the church \u2013 one of the most popular saints and the patron saint of sailors, merchants and bankers.\nThe life of St. Nicholas is depicted in 18 scenes in the narthex (the second section of the church). The unknown artists included elements of contemporary life in those scenes, and many of the figures are quite realistic \u2013 especially their countenances. The lunette above the entrance of the narthex displays the Virgin and Child, St. Anna and St. Joachim, and Christ Blessing. St. Catherine, St. Marina, St. Theodore the Studite and St. Pachomius are portrayed in the lower tiers on the walls. The south arcosolium features the scene of Christ Disputing with the Doctors, and the north one, the Presentation of the Virgin. Two highly revered Bulgarian saints are also represented in the narthex \u2013 St. John of Rila (the oldest surviving representation of the saint) and St. Paraskeva (Petka). The hermit St. Ephraim Syrus appears among the monks portrayed here. The expressive realistic portraits of the donors Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, and of the Bulgarian Tsar Constantine Asen Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina \u2013 painted with precision, extraordinary skill and feeling \u2013 are among the oldest portraits of figures from Bulgarian history.\n\n\n==== Authorship ====\nToday the name \u201cBoyana Master\u201d stands for the team of unknown artists who decorated the church and mastered their art in the studios of the Turnovo School of Painting. Boyana is the only and the most impressive wholly preserved monument of the Turnovo School of Painting from the 13th century. According to many leading experts, the world famous frescoes in the Boyana Church played an important role in the development of mediaeval Bulgarian and European painting.\nA name, possibly that of a painter, was discovered during restoration works in 2006\u20132008.  National History Museum director Bozhidar Dimitrov stated: \"The renovation revealed a rare inscription under a layer of plaster on one of the church walls: 'I, Vasiliy inscribed'. The 13th-century 'Boyana master' was the only painter among the kings and nobles whose names were regularly read out during sermons at the church.\" Restorator Grigoriy Grigorov stated \"The Christian Orthodox religion forbids the painter from manifesting himself, as in the eyes of the priests it is God who guides his hand. But this painter inscribed his name, knowing that the believers could not see it.\" Other historians and archaeologists are less convinced that the inscription identifies the \"master\", since it could equally have been left by an assistant.\n\n\n=== Late frescoes ===\nSome parts of the church were overpainted, and the majority of those frescoes have survived to the present day.\nThe later frescoes include a scene of the Presentation of the Virgin from the 14th century, a portrait of St. Nicholas from the 16th\u201317th century, and representations of the two patron saints of the Boyana Church \u2013 St. Nicholas and St. Panteleimon \u2013 from 1882.\n\n\n== Ktitor inscription ==\nThe church patrons' inscription in Middle Bulgarian from 1259 reads:[1]\n\u205c \u0432\ua641\u044c\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0467 \u047f \ua641\u0435\u043c\u0467 \u00b7 \u0438 \u0441\u044c\ua641\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0467 \u00b7 \u043f\u0440\u0463\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043c\u044c \u00b7 \u0441\u0442\u0483\u0430\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 \u0445\u0432\u0483\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u00b7 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0483\u0430\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0461\n\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0461 \u043c\u046b\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0445\u0432\u0483\u0430 \u00b7 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0438\u043c\u0461\u043d\u0430 \u00b7 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\n\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c\u044c \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043c\u044c \u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u043d\ua659\ua65b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\ua659\u046b \u00b7 \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0461\n\u0463\u043d\u0463 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u1c88\u0447\u0467\u0434\u0430 \u0446\u0440\u0483\u0432\u0430 \u00b7 \u0432\u043d\u1c88\u043a\u044c \u00b7 \u0441\u0442\u0483\u0430\u0433\u2dea \u00b7\n\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u00b7 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0463 \u0441\u0440\u0431\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0433\u043e \u00b7 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0467 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0446\u0440\u0483\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0431\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u00b7 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0463\u0440\u043d\u0463\u043c\u044c \u0438 \u0431\u0433\u0483\u043e\u0447\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0463\u043c\u044c \u00b7 \u0438 \u0445\u0441\u0483\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0463\u043c\u044c \u0446\u0440\u0483\u0438 \u00b7 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u045a\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0463 \u0430\u0441\u0463\u043d\u0438 \u2058 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u00b7\ua641\u0483[\u00b7] \u0432 \u043b\u0463\u0442\u043e\n\u00b7 \u0455\u0483 \u2058 \u0471\u0483\u00b7 \u00b7\u046f\u0483 \u2058 \ua641\u0483 \u2058\nThis immaculate temple of the Holy hierarch Nicholas and martyr Panteleimon was erected from the ground and created with the funds, care and great love of Kaloyan, sebastokrator, cousin of the Tsar, grandson of Saint Stephen, King of Serbia, and was decorated under the Bulgarian Empire under the pious and devout Tsar Constantine Asen.

          "This is a very small church but it is super old and have gorgeous wall writings dated from centuries ago. In this church you will find also wall writings of the royal family which is not typical for churches .The painter is also unknown which makes the church a bit mystical. It",

          "Boyana is a Very beautifull place. the visit is only ten minutes, but worth the effort. we took a day trip with a local guide and it was worth it.",
          "The church is nice itself but not like how they were praising it before I visited.It's in UNESCO list mostly because of frescoes inside but even they are not very well protected as church is very old,it's normal to be in such condition.Plus enterence was 10 levas when I was",
          "If you're of the Christian persuasion and really religious, or really into religious art, you'll probably want to pay a visit. Otherwise, you're going to get quite frustrated -- because many of the Rila Monastery tour buses stop here on the way (or the way back), and they only",
          "Took a taxi, arrived at the park entrance and walked in the calm shadows of the tall trees, accompanied by the music of the birds and insects, to find a very small, red-brick church, bathed in sun. Hardly any other tourists. Waited a bit outside, as people are entering in groups",
          "If you would like to be absolutely fascinated by the modesty and the humbleness of the artists during the medieval age this is the place!",
          "This church has incredible frescoes. While examining, you can see where fresco was painted and then repainted many years later. Tour guide spoke excellent English and tour was quite good. The setting of the church is beautiful!! Don\u2019t miss seeing this church.",
          "This 11th Century UNESCO World heritage church is an absolute must see. Nestled on a green hill, the tiny church hides an inside covered in religious paintings. It was a calm place if beauty. Can't take photos inside buy it is well worth the visit",
          "This is a church built almost a 1000 years ago. You enter in small groups, so you may need to wait a little bit for your turn. There are painting on the wall in separate layers and epochs. I would definitely record visiting this UNESCO protected site. The only thing I thing",
          "Inside are amazing religious paintings of artistic importance, a precursor to the Renaissance. However, the church is small and only 10 persons are allowed at a time. Tour groups get priority to walk-in visitors so it may be worth it to see if there\u2019s a tour going in which you",
          "First of all, this church is really valuable and always worth it to pay a visit. Sadly, after some taxi difficulties I arrived at the church only to find out I was not able to buy a ticket because there were too many groups visiting that day. People can only get in in groups of",
          "Don't miss this lovely old church. You can get here easy with local bus or taxi and visit the gardens and the frescos inside",

          "It is small and about 20 minutes outside of Sofia, but the grounds are lovely and the frescoes inside are beautiful. You have to wait for the guide, because it's cramped inside. It says 10 minutes, but we waited at least 20. No pictures allowed inside.",
          "I guess that many of us have seen many religious buildings in our time, but this one is worth a look. A small very simple structure which lacks the gaudy feel of later built grander churches. maybe built when religion was not as political?",
          "We found the ticket booth for the church and got stared at by an old lady in the booth. She did not say anything, so I asked what tickets cost. We were then told the wait is over an hour due to a large group. We decided then after walking over to the church to buy tickets and",
          "The Boyana Church means wall paintings, which are in the second part of the church. They were painted in 1259 and are one of the most valuable collections of medieval art in the world. The church is surrounded by a small park with gates protecting it from the lively streets",
          "This church is stunning with a beautiful garden upfront and intricate frescoes inside. The visit lasts up to 10 minutes and is quite pricey at 10 lev per person, but with a good guide to explain the history of the church, this money will certainly be well spent.",
          "Quaint little church, in beautiful grounds and not far from Sofia. It is worth going with a guide or, at least, reading up on the church's history to make your visit more fulfilling. There's an entry charge which we found a little steep but they do have to keep the inside",
          "The church is so tiny that guests have to be by small groups inside. No more than 7-8 persons can fit inside at one time. The paintings are fabulous and so well preserved that you can still read the story they tell. Worth the long drive.",

          "A true masterpiece, among the UNESCO heritage sites. It's a tiny church with XIII Century frescos that rival with Giotto's Cappella degli Scrovegni in Padua. Not easy to get into, given that there is limited admittance, but definitely worth the try.",
          "very nice complex with a garden and all facilities, you need a ticket, visits are quite organised because the church itself is very small indeed. Impressive piece of history. Limited commentary or explanation",

          "Going to Boyana church with one of the guided tours is definitely the way to go. We were the first to arrive, even before the gates were opened! We had the place to ourselves and it was so peaceful in the gardens. When we were leaving individual tourists were trying to buy",

          "Went by on the way to Rila Monastery and it was just beautiful. Ended up going in winter and it was so calm, snowy, and pretty. The frescos were so well preserved and the tiny size of the church made it so special. Be sure to go by,",
          "This small Christian church has several layers of art and history of Bulgaria inside of it - remarkable pieces of christian art. It is not close to the city center where most of the tourists go, so it may not get the tourist attention it deserves. It is totally worth the trip",
          "Even if it's a bit far, you can't miss it for the world! Once you get inside you will feel overwhelmed. This was the attraction I loved the most in Sofia",
          "There's no doubt this is an attractive little chapel with some interesting frescoes from 10th and 11th centuries. It is situated in pleasant surrounding on the slopes of Vitosha mountain and access is easy via the 64 bus from the City or the Vitosha tube station. Entry is 10 lev",
          "We went on a group tour to Boyana and Rila Monastery. Boyana was very interesting and OLD and i loved the preserved frescos. The doors were so small that most of us had to bend to get through. People were much smaller in the 13th century :) There is not much else in the area",

          "The moment you visit this site; history engulfs you ; you get in to focus naturally ; good natural weather and fresh air around",
          "Boyana Church is world famous and included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, something characteristic for the Renaissance, which they predate. The admission fee is 10 levs (BGN) per person. also only 8 people allowed at a time. and even many rules, fresco are not not preserved.",
          "We took the tram and the bus after much working out(roadworks!) and spent a lovely afternoon getting to and visiting this lovely place. It is definitely worth the effort of Sofia transport. Beautiful and peaceful place to go. It says you get a guide, but we didn't, but loved the",
          "This took a bit of finding for me, (I was visiting the National Museum and my map showed this as being right beside it. It isn't!). Anyway, though the Church itself is extremely impressive, the time/person restrictions mean I felt rushed, it deserves at least an hour, really,",
          "This lovely church was on my way to Alexander Nevsky Church. I just had to stop and see it. Loved the architecture. Just beautiful.",
          "An amazing church, set in a small but pretty garden. Interesting history and beautiful frescos. (Very pleasantly surprised at how clean and fresh the toilet facilities were!)",
          "A well preserved church from ancient times. Twice extended to accommodate more people. Frescoes are many but a few are intact.",
          "A very small (tiny) church which was built in three parts. The inside frescoes are unbelievable - you'll have approximately ten minutes to appreciate them. For us, this was a stop off on the way to somewhere else. Still, it's a UNESCO site so it's worth a visit.",
          "Firstly, ignore the tourist information that says that you must visit this fantastic building as part of a group. We turned up and bought a ticket and the wonderful guide gave us a tour for two. It was stunning, stupendous, made us think of the distortions of history: here",
          "I did not expect this attraction to be so interesting, I have not heard about it before. This 1000 years old small church is on the UNESCO World Heritage List and it is amazing, how good preserved are the frescoes.",
          "I visited with my 16 and 9 year old kids. We didn't really think it was that special; over hyped Maybe of interest to those interested in history",
          "I really enjoyed the Boyana Church. We took a taxi from Sofia for $4-5, which was much faster and easier than figuring out buses. First you buy your ticket, which is just a receipt. Then you approach the entrance to the church, showing your receipt. There is not a lot of signage",
          "We went with a group and were admitted before the solo travellers who had arrived earlier. They were not so happy about that. The museum was 10 leva and they let ten people come in at a time and you can only stay ten minutes. Fotos not permitted - apperently they had too much",
          "Visited this church on the way back from Rila Monastery. It's a beautiful old church with a large lush garden surrounding it. Some of the trees looked really old. It's a nice place to relax and contemplate. Inside the church is small and requires a ticket to be purchased for",
          "This is a must see place in a trip to Sofia! It is usually part of the tour to the Rila Monastery (another must see place). Very ancient! Strictly controlled visiting, no pictures allowed. It has historical value with regard to its artistic frescos. The church has the most",
          "This church is a must see on a trip to Sofia. It is easily accessible from the no.64 bus. Visitors can get a combined ticket for this and the nearby national museum at a reduced rate. The church has the most beautiful murals depicting scenes from the bible. Max stay in the",
          "Visited this little church as part of the tour that took me to the Rila Monastery. Strictly controlled visit, only 10 minutes inside but enough to admire the paintings and breathe the atmosphere. Located in a park it is just outside Sofia, 15 minutes drive from the centre of the",
          "This church was part of a tour that took us to the Rila Monastery. It is a nice, petit church. Ancient. Very controlled admittance. No pictures allowed. Not an issue. I went online and saved a few for my digital album. It's ok., a nice stopover. Would I make it my goal to visit?",
          "Please note only 10minutes allowed in the Church and we needed to wait for 45minutes to get in as there were 2 group tours which had precedence over individuals. Very interesting when you get in. No photos allowed-but I used a Dictaphone which was very useful!",
          "Quite small and located in a lush park this ancient building is a real treat. The fresco's inside is stunning and captivating, some of them a thousand years old almost. Just a shame you can't stay too long inside because it's easy to get caught up just soaking in the atmosphere",
          "This historic Bulgarian Orthodox Church in a middle-class suburb of Sofia atop a hill is absolutely fabulous and deserves a visit for the beautifully-preserved frescoes!",
          "There are many churches and monasteries in the region, although the Church is a neat place to see the cost to view the interior is a little high for this region.",
          "We went late afternoon. So not many people about. They only let 6-10 people in the church at one time. If a coach trip there you could be queuing. But the grounds are peaceful and shady if it's a hot day. Frescoes in the church are beautiful.",
          "A very beautiful small church with some amazing frescoes. Worth the entry fee as you can only enter with a guide. It's really nice to go for a walk afterwards in the nearby area.",
          "If it wasn't for the fact that this church has stood standing for nigh on a thousand years and managed to avoid the massive bombing campaign during the war, then I would be even more underwhelmed. The church itself is quaint yet tiny (only six people are allowed in at any one",
          "The church is beautiful and the frescoes are stunning. It's far out from the city though, so I recommend booking with a group like Traventuria, which will provide you with transportation.",
          "It was amazing to stand inside this very small church and to think of all the years it has stood, all the history, and to see how vivid and bright the colors still are. It is quite simple inside the church but the experience of seeing it was amazing. The garden surrounding it",
          "A UNESCO world heritage site. A small but very old and unique church dating back to the 10th century. Very unique and beautiful Frescos. Only 10 visitors inside at a time, with a very knowledgeable guide. Amazing works of art. The gardens outside the church are beautiful with",
          "It's a great base to start from when treking up to Boyana Waterfall or to the top of the mountain. I didn't even attempt to enter the church itself as there were large tour groups ahead of me that were slowly filtering in 10 at a time but the building is photogenic from the",
          "Small church on the outside and only 10 persons are allowed in at any one time, this church would is small on the inside also. I did not enter. Walk around the church and see the old grave stones in the grounds.",
          "In the outskirts, inside a garden. It's closed, someone has to come and open the door, only a few people enter each time and you can be inside only 10mn . But it is amazing and unmissable.",
          "The church itself is amazing. But it only takes 8 people at a time, and they are in there for up to 10 mins so depending on the queue you can be there a LONG time and there isn't anything else to do around the church.",
          "What a privilege to visit this church. We went on a combined trip with Rila as we only had a short time in Sofia and didn't have our own transport. It was well worth it. You have 10 minutes time in the church (max 10 people at one time) to preserve the frescos. It's tiny but so",
          "Try to get up to the Boyana Church early. The frescoes are remarkable, and it's worth going on a guided trip to get the full explanation. But the church is tiny and they only allow people in in groups of 8, for 10 minutes per group. You can easily wait half an hour. The grounds",
          "Pay for a guide and listen to him very carefully, these people love their work and if you are genuinely interested in the church and its wall paintings, they will provide you a lot of information.",
          "This small church has a lovely peaceful setting in a small park with lots of trees for shade. The interior is a World Heritage Site and well worth visiting for the 10 Lev fee. You can only enter in small groups and a guide will accompany you. Bags have to be left in a",
          "The frescos are beautiful and guide very knowledgeable. Definitely worth going. But I almost didn't get a ticket 2h before closing mid week as all the slots were sold to groups. Managed to get one finally after 1/2h of waiting as I was only one person. Probably best to go as",
          "It was a visit to a holly and historical place, the Boyana church, which is acknoledged as a site protected by Unesco. The church is unique, amazing freskas and paintings shine on its wall, it is highly valuable and really a holly place.",
          "Visited this on a stop through Boyana (the supermarket in Boyana does amazing food in case you are after lunch like we were) At the church itself very little English spoken we opened the door to the tiny church to a man who clearly only knew the word ticket but could not tell",
          "To be completely honest, inside the church is beautiful but I don't understand the big fuss about this specific church. If you are in the area then it is worth a visit but if it's not convenient for you then don't feel like you are missing out on something amazing. If there is",
          "Dates back to 11/12th centuries and has original frescoes, set in a large forest/park worth a visit.",
          "This is a very small church, but I liked it! You can get there by bus that stops right in front of the entrance. I did not enter the church, but the outside is also very beautiful.",
          "I was surprised at how small the church was but once inside, the frescoes on the walls were amazing. We went as part of a tour and they only allow about 10 people in at a time so we had to split into two groups. I imagine that at busy times there could be quite a long queue to",
          "We arrived with our fantastic tour guide to have a look around this beautiful UNESCO site to be told we needed to cue to get tickets. This was fine and we cued patiently, however the woman the the ticket office proceeded to ignore us and bluntly say she was doing paperwork and",
          "This is a lovely chapel-like church, built in three stages - it's absolutely tiny and decorated with gorgeous frescos inside. It fits 15 people max, you can't take photos or bags in, and the visit is 10 min max. So up to you if you think it's worth a visit. We were taking a bus",
          "Was not expecting the church to be as cool as it was! You're only allowed inside for less than 10 minutes, but it's tiny so that's plenty of time. Fascinating frescos that date back to the 1300's. So glad it survived all this time!",
          "The first part of this Eastern Orthodox Church was built around the late 10th century. The second part in the mid-13th century and the third and last part in the mid 19th century with funds provided by the public. Today it's beautiful architecture, frescoes and ceramic tiles",
          "Despite being small and only allowed in the venue for approx 5 minutes, this is well worth the short trip from town. (take a taxi - very cheap by Western European/US standard) The frescoes are stunning and I have honestly never seen anything like them, anywhere. It would be such",
          "On the outskirts of the city, extremely valuable to see. Unofrtunately, you get only 8 minutes inside. Marvelous 11th-c. frescoes.",
          "Very special with gorgeous historical paintings. A UNESCO world heritage treasure. For me it was worth the while.",
          "Stopped here before returning to town after a visit to Rila Monastery with Vtravel. Only 8 people allowed in the church at a time. Others wait outside. Price steep..10 lev per person. Frescoes divine.",
          "It is a very small but lovely cozy church. Unfortunately we could only allow to stay a few minutes so no time to see the detail of paintings!",
          "This church is a real gem. Unfortunately it's very popular, so arrive early. It's very doable on your own, and I would do it by public transportation. You you can also buy a combination ticket for the National Museum of History (recommended), located in the same general area. I",
          "Fantastic murals & guides there were very interesting & knowledgeable. We took a taxi from Sofia & it was well worth it.",
          "Right in the heart of the city centre, this beautiful, domed church is free to visit and should be a must see for anyone in Sofia. The copper green roof is the highlight of the exterior, but inside, the wall paintings and domed ceiling, together with the artefacts and religious",
          "Highly recommended. Murals are fantastic pre-renaissance art in this outstanding UNESCO world heritage site. If you do one sightseeing trip in Sofia make it this one.",
          "The church is nice to visit. It is with beautiful garden and there you can walk. And in Boyana the air is so clear.",
          "A must see some 10 km. away from downtown Sofia, at the northern slopes of Vitosha mountain, breathtaking views to the city, delicious wining and dinning nearby, a great and unique world class cultural heritage.",
          "If you have time for only one monastery to visit, make it this one. It is included in the UNESCO's World Heritage List. The Boyana Church was built in the 11th c. It is famous for its mural paintings dated 1259 which are said to be several decades ahead of Giotto's masterpieces",
          "The Boyana church is certainly an out-of-the-way site to visit. I had a car while visiting Sofia and there is free parking at the site. Visitors are limited to a 10-minute, escorted visit. Having just come from the Rila Monastery, I wasn't blown away by the murals, but their",
          "This is a wonderful place, you are not allowed to take pictures inside here the temperature and humidity is carefully monitored. But this is just such a special place, it is well worth the visit",
          "A small historic Orthodox church up in the foothills of the mountain side, just outside of the city of Sofia. A Unesco site for the paintings inside the church. Well preserved from the 10-11th century. Best to have reservations as only 7 to 8 people allowed in at a time",
          "Unusual style of church in pretty gardens. The frescoes inside are fascinating, but you only get 10 mins in the church, so you can't really absorb the artwork.",
          "In my opinion this church was over-prized since it is very small and we were told that there was supposed to be a guide but she did not speak to us about the church, she just told us that we could ask questions if we wanted. It was interesting to see the old church walls and the",
          "The Boyana Church is probably best visted as a tour if you do not have your own transport. The entry is 10 leva and you get 10 minutes inside -- although you do not really need more time.",
          "One of the best places to visit while in Sofia. Very close to the city. Suggestion: book a private tourist guide or join a tour if you'd like not only to see but to understand the life engraved and frescoed on the walls. Enjoy!!!",
          "Undoubtedly this is has some interesting frescoes to see inside what is a very small church, but having taken quite some time including a metro ride plus 2 buses to get there we were then restricted to less than 10 minutes to see inside probably more like 8. They also charge 10",
          "It is just robbery, u can go there and pay the tickets fee at the machine, then they wont let u enter and make u pay again for another ticket. It doesn't offer anything to be seen in particular.",
          "We went there not really expecting too much, and we were blown away! The church paintings are just exquisite, quite unlike anything I had seen before. The church itself is beautiful as well, and the guide was very knowledgeable and spoke fluent English. You can only stay in the",
          "It's quite far away from the city centre (take 2 buses or taxi which is very cheap) but definitely worth a visit. It's the ost important and impressive monument in Sofia. You will find there the very finest examples of Bulgarian medieval monumental painting. The staff wasn't too",
          "Five stars if you are an art historian. Four stars is you are visiting for sites to see, with limited interest in art. This very quaint and historic church does a wonderful job of preserving layers of frescos. A well-deserved UNESCO World Heritage site.",
          "Top of the tops. Close to the mountain and the Boyana church museum, Boyana waterfall. Healthy and natural atmosphere",
          "We had heard of the church as worth a visit and decided to see it for ourselves when visiting Sofia. It is really a chapel, situated in a wood-garden on the outskirts of the town, and no more than 8 people are allowed in and can remain there no more than 10 minutes so as not to",
          "We went there with public transportation from the city centre, which was not always easy. But it was worth it. In this very tiny church, the 2 small rooms on the ground floor have superb old frescos. It was a very touching moment to find this jewel in the middle of nowhere.",
          "This is a tiny church in a little clearing just outside of Sofia. The church is very pretty, but with only nine of us inside, it was still crowded and not everyone was able to see the parts of the church as they were being described by the guide. No photographs are allowed, and",
          "Even if you feel you have 'churched yourself out' in Europe, give this one a go. A UNESCO Heritage site located in a gorgeous forest setting gives this place a distinct old world charm. A short drive away is a restaurant in the middle of the forest for some great relaxation.",
          "A gem of frescoes, much earlier than the Italian Renaissance. It is worth visit - get a guide, go around - in the outskirts of Sofia, the mountain is beautiful!",
          "We didn't go inside the church but spent time in the beautiful gardens. A lot of effort has been made to make the garden a lovely peaceful place where wild birds are encouraged and fed. It's a great place",
          "Booked the trip through Traventuria in combination with a trip to Rila Monastery. The garden and the surroundings look somehow a bit run-down. Only 10 minutes inside in the humidity and temperature controlled environment. Very special, for sure, but a must see?",
          "You can get a joint ticket to this place and the National History Museum for 12 lev. As the Boyana Church costs 10 lev on its own, you might as well visit both of them on one trip. They are located about 2 kms apart. The walk to the National History Museum is downhill from",
          "Small building, set in its own wooded grounds, high above the city. Entry is presently 10 lei, and at busy times you might have quite a wait to get entry to the building, as they restrict numbers. If you visit the National History Museum, further down the hill, a combined ticket",
          "The Bgyana Church is not easy to get to. Yes, you probably need to get there by taxi. It is well worth it. There are issues with this site. Tours are timed and sometimes not available. The \"English\" tour I went on was not very good. However, the actual site is beautiful. They",
          "Be sure to include this church in your visit to Sofia. Fascinating place to visit. Only 8 people are allowed into the church at once, so you are not crowded.",
          "This is a very old small chapel with interesting wall paintings. Very beautiful paintings and interesting history. You buy a ticket and then wait outside the church to enter in groups of max 10 persons. You need a guide to tell you the story so that you can appreciate what you",
          "A really interesting tiny church to visit when you are in Sofia. It takes only about a quarter hour to visit but you can see original frescos from the 11th and the 13th century, and the guide lady was really nice and helpful. Worth a visit!",
          "This was suggested as one of the top attractions to see in Sofia by Tripadviser. Therefore i booked a day trip covering Boyana as well as some other monasteries in Sofia plud one in Macedonia. I found Boyana Church to be culturally very fascinating and the Frescos were amazing",
          "The Boyana church is on of the treasures of Bulgarian medieval architecture. It is protected by UNESCO because of its murals that are still preserved in all their glory. Many art historians claim that these paintings well anticipate the Renaissance in West Europe and seeing them",
          "Interesting with plenty of fresco's and lots of history. However entrance fee is too expensive when you consider that you can spend a maximum of 10 min in the church",
          "My boyfriend and me had seen Boyana online and thought it looked interesting. We weren't disappointed. Tickets in to the church were 10 bgn each. I think Boyana would be a beautiful place to visit a little later in the year, when spring really sets in, or summer but was still",
          "I am so glad we made time to visit this ancient church. Holding a tour group of 8 people it is tiny but is brimming with history and colour. The walls hold impressive painting with parts dating back to the 10th century. You need to buy a ticket as entry is timed, being quite",
          "An unique piece of fine art with realistic frescoes on the walls, with picturesque narative fo the Orthodox Christianity icons there",
          "Located in a residential suburb of Sofia this is a truly wonderful little place . Holds only 8 people at a time and interior visits lasting just ten minutes in order to protect the frescoes. History of the church and the colour and detail of the frescoes fascinating. Went as",
          "it is time machine!!! must visit to feel the past the paintings are like photos from 13 century you will feel the iternity",
          "Very small but fascinating church with fresco's dating back to the 10th century. We combined the visit with a taxi trip to the Vitosha mountains as its in the same direction from the city centre. Taxi's are pretty cheap in Sofia and we were lucky to get a helpful driver. The",
          "The church visit was part of our day trip to rila monastery Whilst we enjoyed looking inside the 10 lev per person wasn't value for money when you only get about 5 minutes inside and you can't take photographs",
          "Was amazed to discover such an old yet so well preserved fresco art. The portrait quality was stunning. It looks like pre-renaissance depiction of people, gestures, compositions. Truly wonderful. No wonder UNESCO guards it.",
          "We find this old church accidentally by wondering around the city. I was really surprise that you could enter inside, as usually they are trying to keep you away from places like this ! Worth a visit.",
          "The Boyana church was built in three parts in three different centuries and the oldest part is more than 1000 years old. It is the part of the world herritage because of its frescoes. A bolgarian unknown master paited beautiful lively frescos in the XIth century 200 hundred",
          "Intriguing and monumental site, You can feel it is part of the Christian modest heritage. Recommended",
          "Boyana Church is a little out of the way, but it's certainly worth the trip. While it is a small church, it is historically significant, and it was interesting to see the layers to the religious art going back centuries. The church grounds were quite tranquil, and it's a lovely",
          "This church is really beautiful the guide was very informative and spoke good English The murals were amazing you could see the layers and the faces all different",
          "Nice old church.. inside is very old and nice romantic area around with great mountain scenery. Not much else do there. Nice restaurants but most have poor service and poor attitudes of staff",
          "This little church is a must-visit when in Sofia. The ancient medieval/early renaissance fresco's are very special and well-preserved. The lady who guided us did an excellent job.",
          "A very small church in the outskirts of Sofia, dedicated to St. Nicholas, Boyana is remarkable for the conservation of its frescoes. When I visited the site was covered deep in snow, only the path to the door was accessible, so I did not even have a chance to go around it.",
          "We want to this church earlyish in the morning to try and make the best of our last day in Sofia A definite stopover !!! A Must See The guide are wonderful and the place dates back over a 1000 years ... One of the rare place to see some apocryphal figures too ... Highly",
          "A beautiful very old church with a lovely yard around it, situated in one of the most gorgeous Sofia neighbourhoods. I definitely recommend it! Also, the guide is quite the interesting character! :)",
          "The site is small, but historical for Bulgarians. It is good example of medieval orthodox church. There are some paintings preserved as well.",
          "Located a 30 minute drive from the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia. A UNESCO World Heritage site. Entrance fee = 10 lv per person. Student = 2 lv (student ID required). A museum, no longer an active church. Only 8 persons allowed inside the church at one time. No",
          "The church is founded somewhere back in the end of 10th century! The most of you can see today is from 1256 A.D and the frescoes are from that time ! They are absolutely unique . The unknown artist had broken the religious canon of Bizantine iconography, painting the saints ,",
          "Everyone in Sofia knows this church, but not so many people have been there. It is one of the few complete and perfectly preserved mediaeval monuments. It`s famous with its paintings. Some parts of the church were overpainted, and the majority of those frescoes have survived to",
          "We get astonished, the interior of the church have fantastic frescoes, the place it is small but it is a must see in Sofia.",
          "This church is a little wonderful gem outside Sofia. It's amazing how this very beautiful frescoes of the XIII century are so well preserved after such long time. You can stay inside the church only 10 minutes",
          "It is located in the south of sofia, easily reachable via 1 tram + 1 bus. If you have the opportunity to visit it, I would really rexommend to do it. It has been a very different experience from any other church I have seen so far.",
          "From the outside It was hard to imagine the amazing paintings. I believe that to experience the place you must have the local guide. It seems the he is there since the 13th century\u2026. Do not miss the place, especially if you on your way to the Rila monastery",
          "This is out of the way, so a taxi or car is required from the city center, but it is beautiful inside and out. There is an entrance fee and you can't take photos.",
          "Visited this church on my trip to Boyana Waterfall. Took a taxi with the TaxiMe app for less then 5 euros from the citycentre (didnt feel like searching for all the difficult busroutes). Beautiful frescoes inside the church. The entrance fee of 5 euro is quite high for Bulgaria,",
          "Quite exceptional, small an very cosy church. The entrance is limited to a few people at a time. Worth visiting if you stay 2 days in Sofia.",
          "This tiny church is a UNESCO international cultural site. It includes frescoes from three different periods. Only eight people are allowed in main sanctuary at once, not a problem in December but not sure how much wait there might be at other times. Modest additional charge",
          "Some friends and I were told to go here by a lady we met on the bus to Vitosha mountain, otherwise we wouldn't have known to go here. The church itself is a UNESCO heritage site, but is tiny and tucked away on mountain, although the bus we took dropped us off practically",
          "I didn't know that Sofia had such amazing history, and this is where we started our full day tour of this beautiful Eastern European capital. It's very interesting and has some incredible paintings inside! You shouldn't miss it!",
          "You have to buy a ticket to step inside this beautiful old church. The amount of people inside is limited as is the time allotment. Inside are guides that answer all your questions. The churchyard is interesting as well, explore while you wait for your turn to enter the church.",

          "For the i dipendent traveler to reach Boyana  is a lengthy process but the reward is well worth the effort. The inside of the church is tiny, but the 10 minutes people can spend in are not enough to admire the beautiful frescoes that cover \u2026",
          "We visited Boyana church as part of a tour to Rila monastery. it is a medieval church on the outskirts of Sofia thought to be built in the 10th or 11th century. \nIt costs 10 Lev to go inside and is well worth a visit. I would recommend that \u2026",
          "Gorgeous church on outskirts of Sofia- but the grounds would look better in the summer.",

You can also visit the churchwith guide for 5 euro and if you are in group with 8 persons. The visits are all 30 minutes but it's better to call before to, to  make a reservation.",

However the large number of visitors and time limit inside make it feel a bit more like a system for earning money as opposed to an ancient wonder.

The entry ticket costs 10 leva per adult (2 leva for students) and the visit takes about 10 minutes. If you are nearby Sofia, take some time to visit this church! It is worth it, definitely!",
          "The woman at the ticket office was incredibly rude and kept insisting that \"the tickets were sold out for the day\" which seemed very strange to me since I got there around 1pm (and the closing time was around 5pm). When I asked how come \u2026",

It is situated behind the Sheraton Hotel, amid remains of the ancient town of Serdica.\nBuilt by the Romans in the 4th century, it is a cylindrical domed structure built on a square base. It is believed that it was built on the site of a pagan temple, though the original purpose of the building was for public use. The building is famous for the 12th-, 13th- and 14th-century frescoes inside the central dome. Three layers of frescoes have been discovered, the earliest dating back to the 10th century. Magnificent frescoes of 22 prophets over 2 metres tall crown the dome. Painted over during the Ottoman period, when the building was used as a mosque, these frescoes were only uncovered and restored in the 20th century.\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\n\nThe church is located in the courtyard between the Sheraton Hotel and the Presidency at a level a few metres below the modern streets of the capital. It is considered to be the oldest preserved building in the city, built at a time when Sofia was the residence of the emperors Galerius and Constantine the Great.\nThe church is part of a larger archaeological complex. Behind the apse, there are ancient ruins: a section of a Roman street with preserved drainage, foundations of a large basilica, probably a public building, and some smaller buildings. One of the buildings had been equipped with hypocaust and the tiles lifting the floor can be seen today. Experts define it as one of the most beautiful buildings in the so-called \"Constantine district\" of Serdika-Sredets, where the palace of Emperor Constantine the Great, and later of Sebastokrator Kaloyan were situated. Having survived the trials of time and having kept its appearance almost untouched, it is assumed that some of the most important meetings of the Serdica Ecumenical Council had taken place in the church.\nThe Rotunda is a part of a large complex of ancient buildings from the late 3rd and early 4th century. It was built of red bricks and has a complex symmetry. At the centre, there is a domed rotunda room with a circular plan on a square base with semicircular niches in the corners. Since the 4th century, it has been used for christening (baptising) ceremonies. The dome rises to 13.70 m from the floor. Through the centuries it had been used as a public, religious and even a representative building.\n\nThere are five layers of partially preserved frescoes on the walls: the oldest is a Roman-Byzantine with floral motifs from the 4th century; the second in Bulgarian medieval style with angels from the 10th century; the third from the 11th and 12th centuries \u2013 a frieze with prophets and frescoes depicting the Ascension, Assumption, etc.; the fourth is from the 14th century with a donor's portrait of a bishop north of the entrance, and the fifth with Islamic ornamental motifs.\nOutstanding among all the murals is the one from the 10th century, created most probably during the reign of the emperors Simeon I the Great, Peter I and Samuil. The soulful human face of an angel, painted under the dome, is unique and one of the most influential examples of the high mastership of Bulgarian artistic school of the golden age of the First Bulgarian Empire.\nIn the church, there were kept the holy relics of the patron saint of Bulgaria - John of Rila and, according to the legend, they were used to cure the Byzantine Emperor Manuel Comnenus. The relics were taken by the Hungarians in 1183, during the reign of B\u00e9la III, when allied Serbs and Magyar troops invaded, destroyed and looted the city. \nAfter a short stay in the capital Esztergom, where the Catholic bishop lost his ability to talk after an indecent act with the relics, they were returned to the recently restored Bulgarian Empire in 1187. The relics of the saint rested here again when they were solemnly carried from the then-capital Tarnovo to the Rila Monastery in 1469. At first, here was buried the Serbian king Stefan Milutin, himself beatified, whose relics were later transferred to the Church of St. King (today, the Sveta Nedelya Church).\nDuring the Ottoman rule in the 16th century, the church became a mosque. In the middle of the 19th century, the Rotunda, along with the Saint Sofia Church and the Sofia Mosque (today National Archaeological Museum) was abandoned by the Muslims. Not long later, the Bulgarians reclaimed its original purpose of a Christian church.\nDespite its small size, the church is similar to the rotunda Rotunda of Thessaloniki in Thessaloniki. Carrying the spirit of the early Christian era and Bulgarian medieval culture, St. George has a huge cultural impact. It is subject to extensive research and legitimate interest not only among the Orthodox and Catholic church communities and prominent science and culture figures, but it attracts many pilgrims and ordinary tourists. \nIn exceptional occasions, the church is used as a setting for solemn military ceremonies and concerts with Orthodox and classical music.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Sofia\nSaint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers\nChristianization of Bulgaria\nBulgarian Orthodox Church\nList of oldest church buildings\nAncient Roman architecture\nRotunda (architecture)\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\nEdict of Serdica\nHistory of Sofia\nTimeline of Sofia history\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Bulgarian) Gallery with pictures of the church and the ruins\n(in Bulgarian) Gallery with pictures of the frescoes of the church\n\u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d \u0424\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0446\u044a\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u201e\u0421\u0432. \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u201c, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f 1933 (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430 2005).",

          "The one thing I really enjoyed about the Rotunda Church is the juxtaposition of its centuries-old construction on the modern construction behind it. It is surrounded by more modern buildings, and it makes for a pretty cool reminder of the progress of time. As for the Church",

          "This small church in the round is hidden in an inner courtyard, surrounded by huge buildings, including the Presidency, on all sides. As you face the guards in front of the Presidency, you will see a gate to the left. Enter through here to see the church. Extremely small",

          "Many walking by looking at the changing of the guard may miss this little old church tucked inside a courtyard behind the president's residence. There isn't much inside, but it is worth a time for a look at a crumbling bit of Sofia's history.",

          "The shape gives the name of this little but spectacular ortodox church. It si very old and humble inside but full of holy spirit. It is a tradition to get inside and set some candles to the person you love still alive or died. It si a fantastic and worthy place to visit. It is",
          "This fourth century Church is SO COMPLETE! Worth a stop. Pair it with the St. Sophia Church a few blocks away for a trip back to Serdica.",

          "It was the realization that you're literally walking in the steps of Constantine. Definitely take the extra tour under the church and stop to read the history. It's amazing some of the art that's still visible. Where some of the bigger, fancier churches may dazzle - this is",
          "Small old church, tucked away behind more modern Sofia. Worth going out your way for 15 minutes to appreciate its age and take in how well this has stood time.",
          "Very cute ancient church surrounded on all four sides by modern buildings. It's like time stood in place there, but went on in rest. I loved how it looked and the vibe of the place...it's a bit surreal to find this ancient construction caught between concrete walls. Did not go",

          "This lovely church is a bit difficult to find but if you head for the presidential building with the guards outside it is down the entrance to the left in a courtyard surrounded by buildings . Really worth seeing for its unusual shape and age , we couldn\u2019t go in as a service was",
          "The Rotunda was build on the 4th century BC, so it's the oldest temple in Sofia and it looks very impressive, even at night. It s beautiful inside as well.",
          "A church with a great history so take a guided tour so you can hear it and feel the spirit. Really beautiful and magnetic place.",
          "very intimate and really beautiful space - worth checking out and spending afew minutes to reflect on life",
          "Tour took us here and was really interesting to hear about the history of this place. Don\u2019t miss the changing of guards on the outside of the courtyard too. Hidden gem in a busy city.",
          "Free of charge, the inside looks amazing, paintings are beatiful, great Christian cult monument! It holds some of the remains of St George, if I understood well what I have been told in Bulgarian language, as almost nobody in Sofia seems to be speaking any other language! :))",
          "We struggled to find the Rotund initially (could just be us...). Pleased we had a walk around and also went inside while in Sofia.",
          "It is really old and amazing church with old history. Take some guided tour if you can, because it is interedting to hear about it.",
          "They are so old the remains in here and the church. Really adorable and interesting architecture and ask for some guided tour because there is much to hear about the history.",
          "The most interesting detail about this church is its location: it's in the middle of a square, fully surrounded by big buildings, and completely hidden. The inside is also worth a visit",
          "This church seems almost to have sunk into the fabric of Sofia. It is very small and clearly very old. With the ancient brickwork and characteristic icons it is well worth a visit. Access is free but visitors are encouraged to make donations or buy souvenirs from the shop which,",
          "Built by the Romans in the 4th century, it is a cylindrical domed structure built on a square base. It is believed that it was built on the site of a pagan temple, though the original purpose of the building was for public use. The building is famous for the 12th-, 13th- and",
          "Not an easy to found it, the best if you go through the lobby of the hotel and at the back entrance you will find it. I could not stay just a few minutes since it was a church service.",
          "This church is tucked away in the courtyard behind the Presidential palace and so could be missed. It is surrounded by a very pleasant garden, again with Roman remains. The church contains some very old frescoes which are worth seeing. Won't take long - 10 mins max",
          "The rotunda is hidden a bit between modern buildings, so it was pretty difficult to find, but cool to see a piece of history among the modernness. We ended up seeing it while on a free walking tour of the city. It has a really interesting look and an even more incredible",
          "Cool church in a hidden spot nestled amongst modern buildings. Saw this on our walking tour and has a great history as well.",
          "The Rotunda is the oldest survived building in Sofia. It has very rich history, just to mention that there are 5 layers of frescoes on its inner walls. Do visit the Rotunda - it's right in the centre of the city.",
          "A 6th century church in amazing condition right in the heart of Sofia is impressive enough but the art displayed inside is also quite impressive.",
          "This is a 4th century Christian church tucked away off the main drag. Very interesting from the outside. Small on the inside but atmospheric. Real sense of how old it is by how much the frescos have faded.",
          "One of the oldest monument in Sofia. An attic church in the city center of the town. The object is preserved and is in a good shape that allows you to travel in the past to imagine how our ancestors lived.",
          "The Rotunda of St George is located just behind the president residence. It is very well preserved and is well worth a visit with a guide to actually value all the hidden history in there.",
          "It's beautiful at night with the lighting compared to the day photos. Bulgaria has a lot of Roman ruins throughout the country.",
          "Near the mosque, beneath the boulevard, lies this small Orthodox church. One of the symbols of the town. Great history",
          "Breath taking when you realise that buildings actually have not changed that much through the centuries",
          "Unusual Find whilst strolling through Sofia. No entrance fee and doesn't take very long to see the entire place. Near the archaeological dig outside the Sofia Grand Hotel.",
          "I liked the way this old church was embraced by the government building surrounding it. Could use a little sprucing up.",
          "you can see the history of the architecture in Sofia nothing so spacial as all this city there is all so inside exhibition to see",
          "It is the oldest building in Sofia and definitely worth a look around. There is information on the church itself which is good but there are ruins behind the church and nothing about them which is a shame because it would have been interesting to find out! You are not allowed to",
          "The oldest Church in Sofia with a long history. Very small inside but very beautiful. No photos allowed. Roman ruins have been excavated behind the Church and you can walk around them.",
          "This is a remarkable little church, dating back from the 4th century. Now that the Serdica Roman remains have been uncovered nearby, it is quite easy to imagine this place in a Roman setting. It is very small, but the paintings of the saints are incredible, and the original",
          "Rather small inside, but gorgeous outside. We felt a little rushed when we were walking around, because there seemed to be people watching us. Not the nicest atmosphere, but a nice little place nonetheless.",
          "The Rotunda of St George is allegedly the oldest building in Sofia, dating back to the beginning of the 4th century AD. It has stood the test of time quite well, and is well worth a look when touring Sofia.",
          "This church was built by the Romans in the 4th century amid the remains of historic Serdika. The communists evidently tried to hide it from view by enclosing it within the courtyard of their huge governmental buildings around. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is quite an experience to go into this small church, it is very old and is in a courtyard. It takes a little effort to find it but it is well worth it. Nice and calm, you can buy a candle to help maintain this beautiful church",
          "This church is aside from standard tourist routes. It is not as majestic as all the famous churches of Sofia, built in the late 19th century, but is the oldest one in Sofia. It does not matter which religion you belong to - you just have to enter, admire, sit quietly, thinking",
          "Look for this as its not obvious in the main street. There are also Roman ruins at this site. This was made into a Christian church about 300 AD. It's small inside but still used today. Women should wear a scarf.",
          "Very old church in the center of Sofia, next to the Presidency and a Hotel Balkan. It is with a strange elliptic shape. Worth visiting it.",
          "You have to know where to find this ancient church, but it is well worth finding. The builders of the modern hotel that surrounds it could have taken it down and paved over its ancient churchyard. They didn't, thank goodness, and those who visit are the beneficiaries.",
          "If you come out of the National Archaeological Museum, watch the changing of the guards, you are handy to slip in and see this old church. Very beautiful exterior, well worth a few moments to take a look at.",
          "It's amazing that such old building was preserved so nicely and that is was discovered by sheer accident. Must see in when in Sofia.",
          "It is a lovely church and the frescoes are beautiful. You can walk through the ruins to the church from the Presidency where you can see the guards in their fine uniforms",
          "A lovely little building which could easily be overlooked as it is surrounded by ministerial buildings and it is in a little courtyard on its own.",
          "It was interesting to find this important site surrounded by some very unattractive buildings. The site is worth a quick visit because of its age and Bulgarian significance",
          "This interesting old building that goes back to Roman times is well worth a quick visit. It isn't terribly impressive but because of its age and multiple uses under different cultures in worth some study. It would be easy to miss because it is in the inner courtyard area",
          "Sofia is a city that surprises you positively as you go along. Quite impressive monuments, like this one, and Culture is all around!",
          "This is one of the top sights in the city, part of its ancient heritage. the exterior is a little underwhelming but the interior is impressive for its age, smaller than you may imagine. I think photographs are not permitted and there is a small shop / stall inside selling",
          "Ok, to have a ( quick) look at , I was not so impressed but , I am not an Historian . So I spend not to much time . and it is in the center so when you are there already you can have a quick peep and go to the next site/ museum or other things to see.",
          "I bet you have never seen such a historical monument placed in between an apartment block of flats and the presidential office. The rotunda itself is very nice, definitely worth visiting.",
          "We stumbled across this on a walk through the city. This is a pretty little historic church in the city that looks beautiful. I am not sure of the service times but this looks to be a functioning church. Around the government buildings it is well worth taking a look.",
          "This roman era church is tucked in the center courtyard of a 1960 Bulgarian government offices complex, so can easily be missed. It is near the Archeological Museum and well-worth making a visit. No entrance fee to view the inside of the church.",
          "A nicely shaped little building that has amazingly survived for centuries. It's a bit difficult to find, but well worth making the effort.",
          "You can take pictures outside but you cannot take any inside or the lady there will snap at you. It is okay as the inside is not very photogenic. Go around the backside to see some of the excavation.",
          "This is situated behind the Presidential offices and is worth a visit. It is such a pity that facing it on one side of the square are some very badly maintained buildings.",
          "We would never have found this building without being directed to it during the Free Walking Tour Very well preserved, and interesting to see the different layers which have been excavated. Situated right in the middle of modern buildings.",
          "It's another church in a nice setting, not worth the detour but included in free walking tour. I would not rush back.",
          "This is a really old church in the middle of some other buildings. Definitely worth stopping by for a few pictures and a look around.",
          "An archeological marvel in the middle of the city. A small temple surrounded by what looked like walls of homes it it's time. The brick structure is clear contrast to the concrete jungle it is surrounded by. What sets this apart from the other church buildings are the wooden",
          "If you like history then go see this, very small little church, but very nice to see, only stumbled on it accidentally but glad I did",
          "The small ancient church is in the courtyard of government buildings where there are roman ruins to be seen. Visited this as part of the Sofia Free Walking Tour. Worth a look.",
          "We came across it by coincidence while walking in the city center & went to explore. I would definitely encourage anyone interested in architecture & history to go visit. The inside is merely a round hall with an altar in the front. The bricks are built in such a beautiful &",
          "A short trip to see the ruins they are scattered everywhere but it shows you the old style of houses build in Sofia. Nice little view into the past.",
          "A beautiful, historic building in rather odd but unique surroundings having had newer buildings built all around the outside to enclose the Rotunda. Certainly worth a walk around to see and very easily accessed from the center of the city.",
          "One of the oldest buildings in Sofia, built by the Romans in the 4th Century. Maybe spend 20 minutes here. It is nice to look at; it has been amazingly preserved and very beautiful but due to religious reasons (there are relics and I believe the bones of a Saint buried",
          "The church and the Roman ruins surrounding it tell the early history of Sofia, fka Serdika. The murals inside the church are also well preserved and worth a visit in their own right.",
          "This little place on work the short visit. Very nice murals, and impressive that this small circle is standing for sick a long time...",
          "This church is hidden behind huge buildings. We were not able to go in. Worth visiting to see Roman remains.",
          "Interesting location, with lots to learn about the history of Sofia. The site itself n is worth a visit to observe the many layers of Sofia's history.",
          "The small ancient church is the courtyard of government buildings and a Sheraton hotel. Outside are Roman remains and the church itself is a perfectly formed dome in the middle. Inside is a Bulgarian Orthodox Church with simple, but well executed wall paintings. This is still a",
          "The Rotunda of St. George (Sveti Georgi) has it all: religion - it's still active as an orthodox church. history - it's considered the oldest building in Sofia; it dates back to the 4th century. architecture - this red brick little church has a lovely round shape and arches.",
          "Somewhat hidden from street view behind the Sheraton Hotel. Very small brick church is in excellent condition especially considering its age. Murals inside are from the 10th-14th century.",
          "A little gem in a built up area. I love this church. It is a delight to visit and even it's location is impressive. I tend to access from hotel grand Balkan 's downstairs toilets! You can also access it from the other side",
          "Part of ancient city Serdica, built in 4th century by the Romans, now hidden behind Sheraton hotel and Presidency building. A breathtaking ancient complex.",
          "Considered to be the oldest building in Sofia dating to the 4th century. It sits almost hidden in a courtyard. It sits among ruins of an ancient city. It's in remarkably good condition for a structure of its age.",
          "From the outside it looks like a very lovely Church. Very interesting. We could not enter as we were not wearing the appropriate clothing. Men cannot wear shorts and singlets and women cannot wear dresses without sleeves.",
          "An interesting visit to this ancient ruin that was actually inside the Palance ground. Visitors were allowed with no admission charges. Worth a visit. Sofia is full of Roman and ancient ruins.",
          "Set in a quiet area behind the presidency and in the ruins of a Roman street, it was built by the Romans in the 4th century, used as a mosque by the Ottomans and then restored in the 20th century.",
          "It's in a square surrounded by high end establishments. The church is very beautiful and worth a visit.",
          "A hidden gem in the center of Sofia, this early Roman round church is a must-see (and it only takes a few minutes to see it as it is small).",
          "Do take time to find this church, I was amazed how such a gem, hidden away in a courtyard surrounded by buildings was not crowded with tourists. The place is quiet, you can walk around the remains of the previous establishments, I think I even saw a basis for the ancient",
          "I like history and I liked the church and its surroundings.. especially when I knew it's the oldest church in Sofia. Worth the visit",
          "The location of the building in a hotel courtyard makes this a pleasant surprise when walking around the centre of Sofia. There are other ruins on the site but the Rotunda is intact. There is not a great deal to see inside and it is a church where no photography is allowed",
          "Definetely worth a visit, it a lovely church close to the presidential palace, hidden from the street, but really nice. Once inside you can sit and see icons all around the church. I highly recommend to pop in.",
          "Our 'free Sophia tour' guide made this church interesting and worth a visit- without her information there was little to be impressed by. Very small church with no notable features- a shame one section is being used as make do storage!",
          "This is a beautiful old church building in the grounds (at the rear of) the Sheraton Hotel in Sofia - well worth a visit.",
          "Not clearly visible as you walk around as it's inside the courtyard of the surrounding building. But once there you can wander around it and the surrounding roman remains. There was a service on while we were there but that only added to the history and dignity of the building.",
          "The church is located in the courtyard between two buildings. It is a lovely church and the frescoes are beautiful. However when you have signs on the door that say no photos in 6 different languages I do believe they are serious about the no photo. While I was there at least",
          "This is an old place. One of the oldest in Sofia. It is somehow hidden beyond tall buldings. But it worth to be visited.",
          "This well preserved rotunda is nestled in the rectangular courtyard of the grand state buildings. You happen upon it going through the archway of one of the buildings into another world. The deep red brick and curved ruins give contrast to the angular precise grey white",
          "Visit this beautiful and still functioning ancient Bulgarian Orthodox Church in the heart of the capital of Bulgaria",
          "It is a small church but you can feel God's presence. It is phenomenal to be able to visit a place that thousands and thousands of people went to pray throughout many centuries.",
          "An interesting church surrounded by modern buildings (by comparison). You can walk through the ruins to the church from the Presidency where you can see the guards in their fine uniforms. Unfortunately the church was closed when we went but it is open in the day. For full",
          "There is this well preserved Roman circular domed church with extensive additional remains. Church still in use.",
          "The Rotunda of St George is tucked away in a large courtyard behind the President of Bulgaria's HQ. The building is almost 2,000 years old and has been a place of worship for all of that time. It was a church until the 1500s and then when the Muslim invasion of Bulgaria took",
          "Very nice church. Our tour guide took us there and explained the history of the place. This church is actually the same as the Rotonda in Thessaloniki, Greece! It is a good attraction!",
          "Rotunda ( Sveti Georgi ) is the church in the court of Bulgarian Presidential palace. In any case you'll pass it on the walking tour in Sofia. Stop and take a photo.",
          "This little brick church is something of a surprise, tucked into a courtyard formed by grand government buildings which tower above it. There's an archaeological site in front of it. It's a pretty church, in the Armenian style, and it's setting gives it a quirky feel. Well",
          "The ancient church stands in the middle of old Roman foundations and a section of Roman - unfortunately there is little in writing there for the tourist so take a good tour book with you. I found many of the opulent Sofia churches to be lacking in any sense of spirituality but",
          "This is the oldest building in Sofia that is still in ~1 piece. It is approximately 17 centuries old.",
          "Despite not being a big fan of religious forms of art, the inside of the 4th century church it's an evocative place and full of symbolism by standing next to the very palace of the Emperor Constantine. The entrance is free and a woman working there offered the visitors some",
          "When traveling Europe once you have seen 10 churches it starts to feel like you have seen them all... This church didn't stand out to me at all but in saying that It's age and how in tact it is does make it unique. It's free entry and convenient to get to.",
          "The atmosphere and the architecture there helping you to get in and to feel the past. The weather was good when i was there and it's amazing in the hearth of Sofia",
          "I love this place and its odd location- sunken under busy modern streets but still maintaining a holy presence. I am also thrilled that more archeological restorations are going on around it, revealing Roman and Byzantine Sofia, old bath houses, etc. If you need a 20 minute",
          "Ok, it was hard to find this but it's totally worth a visit. If you are in front of the archaeological museum, just go towards the guards and the gate with the brass lion, and you'll find it. The ruins are 4th c bc, and the church is Christian - really small, but very pretty.",
          "The church is built in the place of the old church. It was an interesting building, but let down by the fact you can't take photos. Really disappointing, and totally unnecessary.",
          "Awesome site, with the Roman bath ruins outside, then the medieval church, all situated in the courtyard of this huge gov. building",
          "One of the oldest buildings ever. Nicely preserved and covered in the Free Sofia Tours as well. Centrally located too",
          "A rather ugly, new building has been built entirely around the old church, so it can't be seen from the street and you have to enter the imposing (but not very attractive) Presidential building - that houses a hotel - to see the church in the centre. The church itself is mainly",
          "A heritage of ancient Rome, the St Georgi Rotunda Church was built in the IVth c. It is famous for being the oldest architectural monument in Sofia and the only building which remained intact from as far back as the Roman Empire. It is located in the courtyard between Sofia",
          "One of the oldest buildings in Sofia. The original frescos can be seen. It's in the courtyard of the Hotel Balkan.",
          "So this is what the early Christians built to worship, once they were able to come out of the catacombes? Around the structure are other ruines, but nearby you find even more. Quite interesting, here in Down town Sofia.",
          "Surrounded by modern ministry buildings, this church's beauty is actually enhanced by its backdrop. Worth having a look.",
          "This church sits just next to the office of the Bulgarian President. In the midst of fancy colourful buildings, this rotunda conveys a sense of divine power with its simple Romanesque architectural style. It just gives you a sense of peace when you are in there.",
          "Really nice it deserves a visit!!! I really recommend! It's nice outside and really pretty. Do not miss!!!",
          "Wonderful oldest small church inside a prestigious building in Sofia. Free entrance and it is unbelievable the position inside the ministry. O the left there is the Casino and in front of it you can find Night Club. The it's history is oldest of Sofia. I wish you to visit",
          "A strong contrast in Sofia. Just beside the Church Sveta Nedelya you have the most ancient monument of the city of Sofia!",
          "Lovely red bricked rotunda surrounded by partially excavated ruins but curiously in a sort of courtyard surrounded by much more recent/modern high rise buildings. It really is a strange setting for such a venerable old church to be in! We happened upon it by accident actually",
          "The church is tucked away in a courtyard behind other buildings and is hidden! Inside the church is is peaceful and impressive but also rather dark! Do not attempt to take photographs - it is not allowed! Outside, at the rear of the building, there are ruins which are very",
          "This is a hidden small church - quite a bit older than the Bulgarian cathedral near by. While it is small - it's simplicity is attractive. I visited just after the second Sunday after Easter - and there was a beautiful new icon of St. Thomas placing his hand in the side of the",
          "Hidden between encircling buildings comprising a hotel and the Presidential building, this temple is well worth a visit to admire both the historic remains outside, as well as the impressive interior. There is a fairly comprehensive English translation of the building's history",
          "Visited on a Sunday and it was very peaceful. I did not go inside but it is a significant ancient sight to visit.",
          "Loaded with history and religion. The oldest preserved building in Sofia, partially built with the stones of the ancient Roman baths. Ironically, in the blossoms just outside the church, the threads of red and white cotton mark the beginning of Spring and are part of a belief",
          "Found it while walking back found afternoon out tucked behind President's Office. Good example of ancient site and interesting to examine",
          "This small church is an extremely rare survivor of Byzantine-era Sofia, then known as Serdica. It is a reminder of how strongly Bulgarian art was influenced by Byzantium, as with its sturdy brick walls and vivid murals, it is quite similar to the Bulgarian churches of the Middle",
          "The Rotunda is nice for a quick walk and visit, since you are in Sofia pass by it as it's in the middle of the downtown. Nice visit",
          "Its a must go a must visit church. A lpt of information you can find there and read the history of the church. Its very close to citu center and a lot of other sightseeing.",
          "This is a hidden gem it is in all the books about Bulgaria but it's not obvious to find, it is tucked away behind some buildings not available to be seen in plain view. It is surrounded by roman ruins. Definitely worth a look at and to go inside.",
          "We stumbled upon this lovely place while we were walking aimlessly checking out the area.Pleasantly surprised to see it.Well preserved and popular with tour groups.",
          "Interesting, however we didn't stay too long as we saw an unaccompanied back pack on one of the seats, so we left as soon as we saw it, that said, nobody else could be bothered, ah so that the serious side of travelling for us ........SECURITY.",
          "The ruins are a little bit rebuild so the magic is a little bit gone. However it's still something beautiful to see.",
          "The location of StGeorge's church alone is worth a visit. Enclosed inside one of the main soviet buildings, it offers a blast of the past, contrasting quite a lot with the surrounding communist architecture. That being said, there isn't much to this church. Whilst its story is",
          "One of eye candy places of Sofia. It is not a miracle but if you are close to it. Worth for a few minutes to see. It's position is centeral and easy to see. You can just look up and go your way.",
          "Rotunda is one of the oldest church buildings in Bulgaria and Europe. It's situated near the subway called Serdica, situated in the courtyard of Sheraton Hotel. Its the place which is worth to visit, a small ancient church and Ruins of ancient Serdica will make you thinking",

          "This is a really old church in the center of Sofia. From the times of Roman Empire. When Sofia was west door of empire. Very impressive old times.",
          "This place is well hidden ( Find the Sofia Balkan Hotel , the rest is up to you) but worth searching for.",
          "Nice church behind change of guards inside a square around buildings. Nice frescoes inside, people praying no photos, the rest outside Roman.",
          "We stumbled across this 'Rotunda' by chance as there is an entrance from one of the main street. As soon as we saw this we were amazed by it, it looked like a pool of snow with ruins to parkour. The church itself has nothing to see to be honest, but we jumped to the ruins and",
          "The history is interesting and makes the structure even more impressive. Nice area of Sofia. Sofia is a easy tourist city and a lot can be seen in a short time.",
          "Very small but impressive church in the center of the city. It is hidden among the new buildings and the contrast is spectacular.",
          "Piece of history but not much see do inside or out except say you been there and took pics. Interesting history but it hidden away these ruins are so need friend tell you of it",
          "Small round beauty of the bolgarian architecture on ruins of a roman temple. Simple, peacefull place,",
          "Hidden away in the courtyard surrounded by the old communist party building this is a hidden gem. Access it by going past the entrance to the presidential building where you can also see the ceremonial changing of the guard.",
          "This church should be more exposed and shine in natural beauty. Surrounded by newer, higher buildings looses all its glory. I found it only by coincidence. Still looks amazing when you come closer.",
          "I know this place is popular with wedding couples but probably not in winter. It was covered in snow, modern buildings around it takes away from authentic look and feeling. Could visit since it very close to all the other attractions but don't go out of your way :)",
          "Another one old and well kept church. The good point is the location. The church is surrounded by big well known buildings. Also it's a path under the building of ministry. If you're lucky you can see the National guards walking in the front.",
          "This is a beautiful building in the centre of a square of more modern buildings (though it looks a bit like it belongs in the countryside) - I believe it's covered on the free Sofia tour and its definitely worth a visit!",
          "Tucked away to preserve it during Soviet rule, there are two walkways to enter to see the rotunda of St George. Roman ruins are in front of it. Inside you can see the three layers of paintings.",

It is located in the centre of the city, with the facade facing the City Garden.\nFounded in 1904 by the artists from the Salza i Smyah company, it was initially called simply the National Theatre, but before being named after the prominent writer Ivan Vazov it also bore the name of Krastyu Sarafov between 1952 and 1962. Incidentally Vazov's play, \"The Outcasts\" was the first to be performed at the theatre when it opened. The theatre's Neoclassical building, designed by famous Viennese theatre architects Hermann Helmer and Ferdinand Fellner, was finished in 1906 and opened on 3 January 1907. The building was extensively damaged by a fire in 1923 during an anniversary celebration, but was reconstructed in 1929 by German architect Martin D\u00fclfer.\nA theatrical school was established as part of the National Theatre in 1925. The bombing of Sofia in World War II caused considerable damage to the building, but it was reconstructed in 1945. Another reconstruction followed in 1971\u20131975, and a \u20ac100,000 restoration project was implemented in 2006.The Ivan Vazov National Theatre has a well-equipped main stage with 750 seats, a smaller 120-seat stage and an additional 70-seat one on the fourth floor.\nThe building's facade is depicted on the obverse of the Bulgarian 50 levs banknote, issued in 1999 and 2006.The theatre has been host to productions from notable theatre directors such as Alexander Morfov who has been the Chief director since 1993.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHistorical photographs of the Ivan Vazov National Theater\nOfficial Facebook Page\n3D Laser scanning of the interior",

        "wiki": "Sofia ( SOH-fee-\u0259, SOF-; Bulgarian: \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, romanized: Sofiya, IPA: [\u02c8s\u0254fij\u0250] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. The city is at the foot of Vitosha mountain in the western part of the country. Being in the centre of the Balkans, it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, and closest to the Aegean Sea.Sofia is the 13th largest city in the European Union. It is surrounded by mountains, such as Vitosha by the southern side, Lyulin by the western side, and the Balkan Mountains by the north, which makes it the second highest European capital after Madrid. The city is built on the Iskar river, and has many mineral springs, such as the Sofia Central Mineral Baths. It has a humid continental climate. Being Bulgaria's primate city, Sofia is home of many of the major local universities, cultural institutions and commercial companies. The city has been described as the \"triangle of religious tolerance\". This is due to the fact that three colossal temples of the three world major religions\u2014Christianity, Islam and Judaism\u2014reside inside the borders of the city, which are the Sveta Nedelya Church, Banya Bashi Mosque and Sofia Synagogue.  \nSofia has been named one of the top ten best places for start-up businesses in the world, especially in information technologies. Sofia was Europe's most affordable capital to visit in 2013. In 1979, the Boyana Church in Sofia was included onto the World Heritage List, and it was deconstructed in the Second Bulgarian Empire, holding much patrimonial symbolism to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. With its cultural significance in Eastern Europe, Sofia is home to the National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria, the National Palace of Culture, the Vasil Levski National Stadium, the Ivan Vazov National Theatre, the National Archaeological Museum, and the Serdica Amphitheatre. The Museum of Socialist Art includes many sculptures and posters that educate visitors about the lifestyle in communist Bulgaria.The population of Sofia declined from 70,000 in the late 18th century, through 19,000 in 1870, to 11,649 in 1878, after which it began increasing. Sofia hosts some 1.23 million residents within a territory of 492 km2, a concentration of 17.5% of the country population within the 200th percentile of the country territory. The urban area of Sofia hosts some 1.54 million residents within 5723 km\u00b2, which comprises Sofia City Province and parts of Sofia Province (Dragoman, Slivnitsa, Kostinbrod, Bozhurishte, Svoge, Elin Pelin, Gorna Malina, Ihtiman, Kostenets) and Pernik Province (Pernik, Radomir), representing 5.16% of the country territory. The metropolitan area of Sofia is based upon one hour of car travel time, stretches internationally and includes Dimitrovgrad in Serbia. Unlike most European metropolitan areas, it is not to be defined as a substantially functional metropolitan area, but is of the type with \"limited variety of functions\". The metropolitan region of Sofia is inhabited by a population of 1.68 million and is made up of the whole provinces Sofia City, Sofia and Pernik, comprising more than 10,000 km\u00b2.\n\n\n== Names ==\n\nFor the longest time the city possessed a Thracian name, Serdica, derived from the tribe Serdi, who were either of Thracian, Celtic, or mixed Thracian-Celtic origin. The emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus (53 \u2013 117 AD) gave the city the combinative name of Ulpia Serdica; Ulpia may be derived from an Umbrian cognate of the Latin word lupus, meaning \"wolf\" or from the Latin vulpes (fox).\nIt seems that the first written mention of Serdica was made during his reign and the last mention was in the 19th century in a Bulgarian text (\u0421\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0456\u0438, Sardaki). Other names given to Sofia, such as Serdonpolis (\u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, \"City of the Serdi\" in Greek) and Triaditza (\u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b6\u03b1, \"Trinity\" in Greek), were mentioned by Byzantine Greek sources or coins. The Slavic name Sredets (\u0421\u0440\u0463\u0434\u0435\u0446\u044a), which is related to \"middle\" (\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430, \"sreda\") and to the city's earliest name, first appeared on paper in an 11th-century text. The city was called Atralisa by the Arab traveller Idrisi and Strelisa, Stralitsa or Stralitsion by the Crusaders.The name Sofia comes from the Saint Sofia Church, as opposed to the prevailing Slavic origin of Bulgarian cities and towns. The origin is in the Greek word sophia (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1) \"wisdom\". The earliest works where this latest name is registered are the duplicate of the Gospel of Serdica, in a dialogue between two salesmen from Dubrovnik around 1359, in the 14th-century Vitosha Charter of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman and in a Ragusan merchant's notes of 1376. In these documents the city is called Sofia, but at the same time the region and the city's inhabitants are still called Sredecheski (\u0441\u0440\u0463\u0434\u0435\u0447\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0438, \"of Sredets\"), which continued until the 20th century. The Ottomans came to favour the name Sofya (\u0635\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0647). In 1879 there was a dispute about what the name of the new Bulgarian capital should be, when the citizens created a committee of famous people, insisting for the Slavic name. Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of Sofia for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title Sredets for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSofia City Province has an area of 1344 km2, while the surrounding and much bigger Sofia Province is 7,059 km2. Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the Balkans. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the Sofia Valley that is surrounded by the Balkan mountains to the north. The valley has an average altitude of 550 metres (1,800 ft). Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three mountain passes lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between Black and Aegean Seas.\nA number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the Boyanska, Vladayska and Perlovska. The Iskar River in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in Rila, Bulgaria's highest mountain, and enters Sofia Valley near the village of German. The Iskar flows north toward the Balkan Mountains, passing between the eastern city suburbs, next to the main building and below the runways of Sofia Airport, and flows out of the Sofia Valley at the town of Novi Iskar, where the scenic Iskar Gorge begins.The city is known for its 49 mineral and thermal springs. Artificial and dam lakes were built in the twentieth century.\n\nWhile the 1818 and 1858 earthquakes were intense and destructive, the 2012 Pernik earthquake occurred west of Sofia with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a much lower Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). The 2014 Aegean Sea earthquake was also noticed in the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSofia has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb; Cfb if with \u22123 \u00b0C isotherm) with an average annual temperature of 10.4 \u00b0C (50.7 \u00b0F).\nWinters are relatively cold and snowy. In the coldest days temperatures can drop below \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), most notably in January. The lowest recorded temperature is \u221231.2 \u00b0C (\u221224 \u00b0F) (16 January 1893). Fog is not unusual, especially in the beginning of the season. On average, Sofia receives a total snowfall of 96 cm (37.8 in) and 58 days with snow cover. The snowiest recorded winter was 1995/1996 with a total snowfall of 171 cm (67.3 in). The record snow depth is 57 cm (22.4 in) (25 December 2001). The coldest recorded month was January 1942 with an average temperature of \u22129.3 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F), while the coldest year on record was 1940 with an annual temperature of 8.3 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F).Summers are quite warm and sunny. In summer, the city generally remains slightly cooler than other parts of Bulgaria, due to its higher altitude. However, the city is also subjected to heat waves with high temperatures reaching or exceeding 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) in the hottest days, particularly in July and August. The highest recorded temperature is 41 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) (5 July 2000 and 24 July 2007). The hottest recorded month was July 2012 with an average temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). The warmest year on record was 2019 with an annual temperature of 11.9 \u00b0C (53 \u00b0F).Springs and autumns in Sofia are usually short with variable and dynamic weather.\nThe city receives an average precipitation of 581.8 mm (22.91 in) a year, reaching its peak in late spring and early summer when thunderstorms are common. The driest recorded year was 2000 with a total precipitation of 304.6 mm (11.99 in), while the wettest year on record was 2014 with a total precipitation of 1,066.6 mm (41.99 in).\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nThe geographic position of the Sofia Valley limits the flow of air masses, increasing the chances of air pollution by particulate matter and nitrogen oxide. Solid fuel used for heating and motor vehicle traffic are significant sources of pollutants. Smog thus persists over the city as temperature inversions and the mountains surrounding the city prevent the circulation of air masses. As a result, air pollution levels in Sofia are some of the highest in Europe.Particulate matter concentrations are consistently above the norm. During the October 2017 \u2013 March 2018 heating season, particulate levels exceeded the norm on 70 occasions; on 7 January 2018, PM10 levels reached 632 \u00b5g/m3, some twelve times the EU norm of 50 \u00b5g/m3. Even areas with few sources of air pollution, like Gorna Banya, had PM2.5 and PM10 levels above safe thresholds. In response to hazardous spikes in air pollution, the Municipal Council implemented a variety of measures in January 2018, like more frequent washing of streets. However, a report by the European Court of Auditors issued in September 2018 revealed that Sofia has not drafted any projects to reduce air pollution from heating. The report also noted that no industrial pollution monitoring stations operate in Sofia, even though industrial facilities are active in the city. A monitoring station on Eagles' Bridge, where some of the highest particulate matter values were measured, was moved away from the location and has measured sharply lower values since then. Particulates are now largely measured by a network of 300 sensors maintained by volunteers since 2017. The European Commission has taken Bulgaria to court over its failure to curb air pollution.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nSofia has been an area of continuous human habitation since at least the 30th millennium BC. The city itself has a history of nearly 7000 years, with the great attraction of the hot water springs that still flow abundantly in the centre of the city. The neolithic village in Slatina dating to the 5th\u20136th millennium BC is documented. Remains from another neolithic settlement around the National Art Gallery are traced to the 3rd\u20134th millennium BC, which has been the traditional centre of the city ever since.The earliest tribes who settled were the Thracian Tilataei. \nIn the 500s BC, the area became part of a Thracian state union, the Odrysian kingdom from another Thracian tribe the Odrysses. For a short period Thracian rule was possibly interrupted by the Achaemenid Empire.\nIn 339 BC Philip II of Macedon destroyed and ravaged the town for the first time.The Celtic tribe Serdi gave their name to the city. The earliest mention of the city comes from an Athenian inscription from the 1st century BC, attesting Astiu ton Serdon, i.e. city of the Serdi. The inscription and Dio Cassius told that the Roman general Crassus subdued the Serdi and behanded the captives.In 27\u201329 BC, according do Dio Cassius, Pliny and Ptolemy, the region \"Segetike\" was attacked by Crassus, which is assumed to be Serdica, or the city of the Serdi. The ancient city is located between TZUM, Sheraton Hotel and the Presidency. It gradually became the most important Roman city of the region. It became a municipium during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98\u2013117). Serdica expanded, as turrets, protective walls, public baths, administrative and cult buildings, a civic basilica, an amphitheatre, a circus, the City council (Boul\u00e9), a large forum, a big circus (theatre), etc. were built. Serdica was a significant city on the Roman road Via Militaris, connecting Singidunum and Byzantium. In the 3rd century, it became the capital of Dacia Aureliana, and when Emperor Diocletian divided the province of Dacia Aureliana into Dacia Ripensis (at the banks of the Danube) and Dacia Mediterranea, Serdica became the capital of the latter. Serdica's citizens of Thracian descent were referred to as Illyrians probably because it was at some time the capital of Eastern Illyria (Second Illyria).Roman emperors Aurelian (215\u2013275) and Galerius (260\u2013311) were born in Serdica.\nThe city expanded and became a significant political and economical centre, more so as it became one of the first Roman cities where Christianity was recognised as an official religion (under Galerius). The Edict of Toleration by Galerius was issued in 311 in Serdica by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity. The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of \"religio licita\", a worship recognised and accepted by the Roman Empire. It was the first edict legalising Christianity, preceding the Edict of Milan by two years.\nFor Constantine the Great it was 'Sardica mea Roma est' (Serdica is my Rome). He considered making Serdica the capital of the Byzantine Empire instead of Constantinople. which was already not dissimilar to a tetrarchic capital of the Roman Empire. In 343 AD, the Council of Sardica was held in the city, in a church located where the current 6th century Church of Saint Sophia was later built.\nThe city was destroyed in the 447 invasion of the Huns and the city laid in ruins for a century It was rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. During the reign of Justinian it flourished, being surrounded with great fortress walls whose remnants can still be seen today.\n\n\n==== Archaeology ====\nMany remains of the ancient city have been excavated and are on public display today. These include:\n\nComplex Ancient Serdica\neastern gate\nwestern gate\ncity walls\nthermal baths\nbridge over the river\n4th c. church of St. George Rotunda\namphitheatre of Serdica\nthe tombs and basilicas under the basilica of St. Sophia\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe city first became part of the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Krum in 809, after a long siege. Afterw\u0430rds, it grew into an important fortress and administrative centre when Khan Omurtag made it a centre of Sredets province (Sredetski komitat, \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442). After the conquest of the Bulgarian capital Preslav by Sviatoslav I of Kiev and John I Tzimiskes' armies in 970\u2013971, the Bulgarian Patriarch Damyan chose Sofia for his seat in the next year and the capital of Bulgaria was first moved to Sredets. In the second half of 10th century the city was ruled by Komit Nikola and his sons, popular as \"Komitopuli\". One of them is Samuil, who became an Emperor of Bulgaria in 997. After a number of unsuccessful sieges, the city fell to the Byzantine Empire in 1018, but once again was incorporated into the restored Bulgarian Empire at the time of Tsar Ivan Asen I.\n\n\n=== Early modern history ===\nIn 1385, Sofia was seized by the Ottoman Empire in the course of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars. Around 1393 it became the seat of newly established Sanjak of Sofia.The city was occupied by Hungarian forces for a short time in 1443. After the failed crusade of W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland in 1443 towards Sofia, the city's Christian faced persecution and the city became the capital of the Ottoman province (beylerbeylik) of Rumelia for more than four centuries. During that time Sofia was the largest import-export-base in modern-day Bulgaria for the caravan trade with the Republic of Ragusa. In the 15th and 16th century, Sofia was expanded by Ottoman building activity. Public investments in infrastructure, education and local economy brought greater diversity to the city. Amongst others, the population consisted of Muslims, Bulgarian and Greek speaking Orthodox Christians, Armenians, Georgians, Catholic Ragusans, Jews (Romaniote, Ashkenazi and Sephardi), and Romani people.\n\nWhen it comes to the cityscape, 16th century sources mention eight Friday Mosques, three public libraries, numerous schools, 12 churches, three synagogues, and the largest bedesten (market) of the Balkans. Additionally, there were fountains and hammams (bathhouses). Some prominent churches such as Saint Sofia had been converted into mosques. In total there were 11 big and over 100 small mosques by the 17th century, of which only the Banya Bashi remains as a mosque today.\nThe town was seized for several weeks by Bulgarian hajduks in 1599. In 1610 the Vatican established the See of Sofia for Catholics of Rumelia, which existed until 1715 when most Catholics had emigrated. The town was the centre of Sofia Eyalet (1826\u20131864). Nedelya Petkova created the first Bulgarian school for women in the city. In 1873 the Ottomans hanged in Sofia the Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski.\n\n\n=== Modern and contemporary history ===\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378, Suleiman Pasha threatened to burn the city in defence, but the foreign diplomats Leandre Legay, Vito Positano, Rabbi Gabriel Almosnino and Josef Valdhart refused to leave the city thus saving it. Many Bulgarian residents of Sofia armed themselves and sided with the Russian forces. Sofia was relieved (see Battle of Sofia) from Ottoman rule by Russian forces under Gen. Iosif Gurko on 4 January 1878. It was proposed as a capital by Marin Drinov and was accepted as such on 3 April 1879. By the time of its liberation the population of the city was 11,649.Most mosques in Sofia were destroyed in that war, seven of them destroyed in one night in December 1878 when a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers. Following the war, the great majority of the Muslim population left Sofia.For a few decades after the liberation, Sofia experienced large population growth, mainly by migration from other regions of the Principality (Kingdom since 1908) of Bulgaria, and from the still Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace.\nIn 1900, the first electric lightbulb in the city was turned on.In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria was fighting alone practically all of its neighbouring countries. When the Romanian Army entered Vrazhdebna in 1913, then a village 11 kilometres (7 miles) from Sofia, now a suburb, this prompted the Tsardom of Bulgaria to capitulate.\nIn 1925, a terrorist act of ultra-leftists failed their attempted assassination of the king but resulted in the destruction of the Saint Nedelya Church and many victims.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bulgaria declared war on the US and UK on 13 December 1941 and in late 1943 and early 1944 the US and UK Air forces conducted bombings over Sofia. As a consequence of the bombings thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged including the Capital Library and thousands of books. In 1944 Sofia and the rest of Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and within days of the Soviet invasion Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany.\nIn 1945, the communist Fatherland Front took power. The transformations of Bulgaria into the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1946 and into the Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 marked significant changes in the city's appearance. The population of Sofia expanded rapidly due to migration from rural regions. New residential areas were built in the outskirts of the city, like Druzhba, Mladost and Lyulin.\nDuring the Communist Party rule, a number of the city's most emblematic streets and squares were renamed for ideological reasons, with the original names restored after 1989.The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum, where Dimitrov's body had been preserved in a similar way to the Lenin mausoleum, was demolished in 1999.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nIn Sofia there are 607,473 dwellings and 101,696 buildings. According to modern records, 39,551 dwellings were constructed until 1949, 119,943 between 1950 and 1969, 287,191 between 1970 and 1989, 57,916 in the 90s and 102,623 between 2000 and 2011. Until 1949, 13,114 buildings were constructed and between 10,000\u201320,000 in each following decade. Sofia's architecture combines a wide range of architectural styles, some of which are aesthetically incompatible. These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgar fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century Rotunda of St. George, the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved Amphitheatre of Serdica.\nAfter the Liberation War, knyaz Alexander Battenberg invited architects from Austria\u2013Hungary to shape the new capital's architectural appearance.Among the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were Friedrich Gr\u00fcnanger, Adolf V\u00e1clav Kol\u00e1\u0159, and Viktor Rumpelmayer, who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country's elite. Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia's centre is thus a combination of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Rococo, Neo-Renaissance and Neoclassicism, with the Vienna Secession also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.\nAfter World War II and the establishment of a Communist government in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. Stalinist Gothic public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around The Largo, Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete tower blocks, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of Brutalist architecture.\nAfter the abolition of Communism in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skryscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The 126-metre (413 ft) Capital Fort Business Centre is the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with its 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.\n\nArchitectural styles in Sofia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Green areas ===\n\nThe city has an extensive green belt. Some of the neighbourhoods constructed after 2000 are densely built up and lack green spaces. There are four principal parks \u2013 Borisova gradina in the city centre and the Southern, Western and Northern parks. Several smaller parks, among which the Zaimov Park, City Garden and the Doctors' Garden, are located in central Sofia. The Vitosha Nature Park (the oldest national park in the Balkans) includes most of Vitosha mountain and covers an area of 266 square kilometres (103 sq mi), with roughly half of it lying within the municipality of Sofia. Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter and during the 70s and the 80s multiple ski slopes of various difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski area has been left to decay in the last 10 years so that currently there is only one chairlift and one slope working.\n\n\n== Government and law ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nSofia Municipality is identical to Sofia City Province, which is distinct from Sofia Province, which surrounds but does not include the capital itself. Besides the city proper, the 24 districts of Sofia Municipality encompass three other towns and 34 villages. Districts and settlements have their own governor who is elected in a popular election. The assembly members are chosen every four years. The common head of Sofia Municipality and all the 38 settlements is the mayor of Sofia. The current mayor Yordanka Fandakova is serving a third consecutive term, having won the 2015 election at first round with 238,500 votes, or 60.2% of the vote, when Reformist Bloc opponent Vili Lilkov was second with 9.6%; the turnout was 41.25%. Some party leaders claimed that ballots were falsified and called for annulment of the election. A precedent happened, due to the suspicion, as a preventative action between 300 and 5000 people and counters had been locked inside Arena Armeets against their will for two days, following which the director of the Electoral Commission of Sofia resigned at the request of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.\n\n\n=== National government ===\nSofia is the seat of the executive (Council of Ministers), legislative (National Assembly) and judiciary (Supreme Court and Constitutional Court) bodies of Bulgaria, as well as all government agencies, ministries, the National Bank, and the delegation of the European Commission. The President, along with the Council of Ministers, is located on Independence Square, also known as The Largo or The Triangle of Power. One of the three buildings in the architectural ensemble, the former Bulgarian Communist Party headquarters, is due to become the seat of the Parliament. A refurbishment project is due to be completed in mid-2019, while the old National Assembly building will become a museum or will only host ceremonial political events.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nUnder Bulgaria's centralised political system, Sofia concentrates much of the political and financial resources of the country. It is the only city in Bulgaria to host three electoral constituencies: the 23rd, 24th and 25th Multi-member Constituencies, which together field 42 mandates in the 240-member National Assembly.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nWith a murder rate of 1.7/per 100.000 people (as of 2009) Sofia is a quite safe capital city. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, crimes, including Bulgarian mafia killings, caused problems in the city, where authorities had difficulties convicting the actors, which had caused the European Commission to warn the Bulgarian government that the country would not be able to join the EU unless it curbed crime (Bulgaria eventually joined in 2007). Many of the most severe crimes are contract killings connected to the organised crime, but these had dropped in recent years after several arrests of gang members. Corruption in Bulgaria also affects Sofia's authorities. According to the director of Sofia District Police Directorate, the largest share of the crimes are thefts, making up 62.4% of all crimes in the capital city. Increasing are frauds, drug-related crimes, petty theft and vandalism. According to a survey, almost a third of Sofia's residents say that they never feel safe in the Bulgarian capital, while 20% always feel safe. As of 2015, the consumer-reported perceived crime risk on the Numbeo database was \"high\" for theft and vandalism and \"low\" for violent crimes; safety while walking during daylight was rated \"very high\", and \"moderate\" during the night. With 1,600 prisoners, the incarceration rate is above 0.1%; however, roughly 70% of all prisoners are part of the Romani minority.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts and entertainment ===\n\nSofia concentrates the majority of Bulgaria's leading performing arts troupes. Theatre is by far the most popular form of performing art, and theatrical venues are among the most visited, second only to cinemas. There were 3,162 theatric performances with 570,568 people attending in 2014. The Ivan Vazov National Theatre, which performs mainly classical plays and is situated in the very centre of the city, is the most prominent theatre. The National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria is a combined opera and ballet collective established in 1891. Regular performances began in 1909. Some of Bulgaria's most famous operatic singers, such as Nicolai Ghiaurov and Ghena Dimitrova, made their first appearances on the stage of the National Opera and Ballet.\nCinema is the most popular form of entertainment: there were more than 141,000 film shows with a total attendance exceeding 2,700,000 in 2014. Over the past two decades, numerous independent cinemas have closed and most shows are in shopping centre multiplexes. Odeon (not part of the Odeon Cinemas chain) shows exclusively European and independent American films, as well as 20th century classics. The Boyana Film studios was at the centre of a once-thriving domestic film industry, which declined significantly after 1990. Nu Image acquired the studios to upgrade them into Nu Boyana Film Studios, used to shoot scenes for a number of action movies like The Expendables 2, Rambo: Last Blood and London Has Fallen.\n\nBulgaria's largest art museums are located in the central areas of the city. Since 2015, the National Art Gallery, the National Gallery for Foreign Art (NGFA) and the Museum of Contemporary Art \u2013 Sofia Arsenal were merged to form the National Gallery. Its largest branch is Kvadrat 500, located on the NFGA premises, where some 2,000 works are on display in twenty eight exhibition halls. The collections encompass diverse cultural items, from Ashanti Empire sculptures and Buddhist art to Dutch Golden Age painting, works by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Auguste Rodin. The crypt of the Alexander Nevsky cathedral is another branch of the National Gallery. It holds a collection of Eastern Orthodox icons from the 9th to the 19th century.\nThe National History Museum, located in Boyana, it has a vast collection of more than 650,000 historical items dating from Prehistory to the modern era, although only 10,000 of them are permanently displayed due to the lack of space. Smaller collections of historical items are displayed in the National Archaeological Museum, a former mosque located between the edifices of the National Bank and the Presidency. Two natural sciences museums\u2014the Natural History Museum and Earth and Man\u2014display minerals, animal species (alive and taxidermic) and rare materials. The Ethnographic Museum and the Museum of Military History hold large collections of Bulgarian folk costumes and armaments, respectively. The Polytechnical Museum has more than 1,000 technological items on display. The SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library, the foremost information repository in the country, holds some 1,800,000 books and more than 7,000,000 documents, manuscripts, maps and other items.\n\nThe city houses many cultural institutes such as the Russian Cultural Institute, the Polish Cultural Institute, the Hungarian Institute, the Czech and the Slovak Cultural Institutes, the Italian Cultural Institute, Confucius Institute, Institut Fran\u00e7ais, Goethe Institut, British Council and Instituto Cervantes which regularly organise temporary expositions of visual, sound and literary works by artists from their respective countries.\n\nSome of the biggest telecommunications companies, TV and radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and web portals are based in Sofia, including the Bulgarian National Television, bTV and Nova TV. Top-circulation newspapers include 24 Chasa and Trud.\nThe Boyana Church, a UNESCO World Heritage site, contains realistic frescoes, depicting more than 240 human images and a total 89 scenes, were painted. With their vital, humanistic realism they are a Renaissance phenomenon at its culmination phase in the context of the common-European art.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nSofia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Bulgaria alongside coastal and mountain resorts. Among its highlights is the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, one of the symbols of Bulgaria, constructed in the late 19th century. It occupies an area of 3,170 square metres (34,122 square feet) and can hold 10,000 people.\nVitosha Boulevard, also called Vitoshka, is a pedestrian zone with numerous caf\u00e9s, restaurants, fashion boutiques, and luxury goods stores. Sofia's geographic location, in the foothills of the weekend retreat Vitosha mountain, further adds to the city's specific atmosphere.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nA large number of sports clubs are based in the city. During the Communist era, most sports clubs concentrated on all-round sporting development, therefore CSKA, Levski, Lokomotiv and Slavia are dominant not only in football, but in many other team sports as well. Basketball and volleyball also have strong traditions in Sofia. A notable local basketball team is twice European Champions Cup finalist Lukoil Akademik. The Bulgarian Volleyball Federation is the world's second-oldest, and it was an exhibition tournament organised by the BVF in Sofia that convinced the International Olympic Committee to include volleyball as an olympic sport in 1957. Tennis is increasingly popular in the city. Currently there are some ten tennis court complexes within the city including the one founded by former WTA top-five athlete Magdalena Maleeva.Sofia applied to host the Winter Olympic Games in 1992 and in 1994, coming second and third respectively. The city was also an applicant for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but was not selected as candidate. In addition, Sofia hosted EuroBasket 1957 and the 1961 and 1977 Summer Universiades, as well as the 1983 and 1989 winter editions. In 2012, it hosted the FIVB World League finals.\n\nThe city is home to a number of large sports venues, including the 43,000-seat Vasil Levski National Stadium which hosts international football matches, as well as the Georgi Asparuhov Stadium and Lokomotiv Stadium, the main venues for outdoor musical concerts. Armeets Arena holds many indoor events and has a capacity of up to 19,000 people depending on its use. The venue was inaugurated on 30 July 2011, and the first event it hosted was a friendly volleyball match between Bulgaria and Serbia. There are two ice skating complexes \u2014 the Winter Sports Palace with a capacity of 4,600 and the Slavia Winter Stadium with a capacity of 2,000, both containing two rinks each. A velodrome with 5,000 seats in the city's central park is currently undergoing renovation. There are also various other sports complexes in the city which belong to institutions other than football clubs, such as those of the National Sports Academy, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, or those of different universities. There are more than fifteen swimming complexes in the city, most of them outdoor. Nearly all of these were constructed as competition venues and therefore have seating facilities for several hundred people.\nThere are two golf courses just to the east of Sofia \u2014 in Elin Pelin (St Sofia club) and in Ihtiman (Air Sofia club), and a horseriding club (St George club).\nSofia was designated as European Capital of Sport in 2018. The decision was announced in November 2014 by the Evaluation Committee of ACES Europe, on the grounds that \"the city is a good example of sport for all, as means to improve healthy lifestyle, integration and education, which are the basis of the initiative.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation growth over the years (in thousands):\n\nAccording to 2018 data, the city has a population of 1,269,384 and the whole Sofia Capital Municipality of 1,328,120. The first census carried out in February 1878 by the Russian Army recorded a population of 11,694 inhabitants including 6,560 Bulgarians, 3,538 Jews, 839 Turks and 737 Romani.\nThe ratio of women per 1,000 men was 1,102. The birth rate per 1000 people was 12.3 per mille and steadily increasing in the last 5 years, the death rate reaching 12.1 per mille and decreasing. The natural growth rate during 2009 was 0.2 per mille, the first positive growth rate in nearly 20 years. The considerable immigration to the capital from poorer regions of the country, as well as urbanisation, are among the other reasons for the increase in Sofia's population. The infant mortality rate was 5.6 per 1,000, down from 18.9 in 1980. According to the 2011 census, people aged 20\u201324 years are the most numerous group, numbering 133,170 individuals and accounting for 11% of the total 1,202,761 people. The median age is 38 though. According to the census, 1,056,738 citizens (87.9%) are recorded as ethnic Bulgarians, 17,550 (1.5%) as Romani, 6,149 (0.5%) as Turks, 9,569 (0.8%) belonged to other ethnic groups, 6,993 (0.6%) do not self-identify and 105,762 (8.8%) remained with undeclared affiliation. This statistic should not necessarily be taken at face value due to conflicting data \u2013 such as for the predominantly Roma neighbourhood of Fakulteta, which alone may have a population of 45,000.According to the 2011 census, throughout the whole municipality some 892,511 people (69.1%) are recorded as Eastern Orthodox Christians, 10,256 (0.8%) as Protestant, 6,767 (0.5%) as Muslim, 5,572 (0.4%) as Roman Catholic, 4,010 (0.3%) belonged to other faith and 372,475 (28.8%) declared themselves irreligious or did not mention any faith. The data says that roughly a third of the total population have already earned a university degree. Of the population aged 15\u201364 \u2013 265,248 people within the municipality (28.5%) are not economically active, the unemployed being another group of 55,553 people (6%), a large share of whom have completed higher education. The largest group are occupied in trading, followed by those in manufacturing industry. Within the municipality, three-quarters, or 965,328 people are recorded as having access to television at home and 836,435 (64.8%) as having internet. Out of 464,865 homes \u2013 432,847 have connection to the communal sanitary sewer, while 2,732 do not have any. Of these 864 do not have any water supply and 688 have other than communal. Over 99.6% of males and females aged over 9 are recorded as literate. The largest group of the population aged over 20 are recorded to live within marriage (46.3%), another 43.8% are recorded as single and another 9.9% as having other type of coexistence/partnership, whereas not married in total are a majority and among people aged up to 40 and over 70. The people with juridical status divorced or widowed are either part of the factual singles or those having another type of partnership, each of the two constitutes by around 10% of the population aged over 20. Only over 1% of the juridically married do not de facto live within marriage. The families that consist of two people are 46.8%, another 34.2% of the families are made up by three people, whereas most of the households (36.5%) consist of only one person.Sofia was declared the national capital in 1879. One year later, in 1880, it was the fifth-largest city in the country after Plovdiv, Varna, Ruse and Shumen. Plovdiv remained the most populous Bulgarian town until 1892 when Sofia took the lead.  The city is the hot spot of internal migration, the capital population is increasing and is around 17% of the national, thus a small number of people with local roots remain today, they dominate the surrounding rural suburbs and are called Shopi. Shopi speak the Western Bulgarian dialects.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSofia is the economic hub of Bulgaria and home to most major Bulgarian and international companies operating in the country, the National Bank and the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. The city's GDP (PPS) per capita stood at \u20ac29,600 ($33,760) in 2015, one of the lowest for a capital region in the EU, but well above other cities in the country. Nominal GDP in 2014 was 32.8 billion leva ($19.1 billion) The average per capita annual income was 6,890 leva ($4,019) in 2014, and average monthly wages in June 2018 were $880, the highest nationally. Services dominate the economy, accounting for 85.9% of gross value added.In 2015, Forbes listed Sofia as one of the top 10 places in the world to launch a startup business, because of the low corporate tax (10%), the fast internet connection speeds available \u2013 one of the fastest in the world, and the presence of several investment funds, including Eleven Startup Accelerator, LAUNCHub and Neveq.Historically, after World War II and the era of industrialisation under socialism, the city and its surrounding areas expanded rapidly and became the most heavily industrialised region of the country. The influx of workers from other parts of the country became so intense that a restriction policy was imposed, and residing in the capital was only possible after obtaining Sofianite citizenship. However, after the political changes in 1989, this kind of citizenship was removed. In 2015, Globalization and World Cities Research Institute ranked Sofia as Beta- world city. As of 12 September 2018, Sofia is ranked among the 100 financial top centres worldwide.Up until 2007, Sofia experienced rapid economic growth. In 2008, apartment prices increased dramatically, with a growth rate of 30%.\nIn 2009, prices fell by 26%.In January 2015, Sofia was ranked 30th out of 300 global cities in terms of combined growth in employment and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2013\u20132014. This was the highest rank amongst cities in Southeast Europe. The real GDP (PPP) per capita growth was 2.5% to $33,105 (28,456 euro) and the employment went up by 3.4% to 962,400 in 2013\u20132014.\n\n\n== Transport and infrastructure ==\nWith its developing infrastructure and strategic location, Sofia is a major hub for international railway and automobile transport. Three of the ten Pan-European Transport Corridors cross the city: IV, VIII and X. All major types of transport (except water) are represented in the city.\n\nThe Central Railway Station is the primary hub for domestic and international rail transport, carried out by Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ), the national rail company headquartered in the city. It is one of the main stations along BDZ Line 1, and a hub of Lines 2, 5 and 13. Line 1 provides a connection to Plovdiv, the second-largest city in Bulgaria, while Line 2 is the longest national railway and connects Sofia and Varna, the largest coastal city. Lines 5 and 13 are shorter and provide connections to Kulata and Bankya, respectively. Overall, Sofia has 186 km (116 miles) of railway lines.Sofia Airport handled 6,962,040 passengers in 2018.Public transport is well-developed with bus (2,380 km (1,479 mi)), tram (308 km (191 mi)) and trolleybus (193 km (120 mi)) lines running in all areas of the city. The Sofia Metro became operational in 1998, and now has two lines and 34 stations. As of 2012, the system has 39 km (24 mi) of track. Six new stations were opened in 2009, two more in April 2012, and eleven more in August 2012. In 2015 new 7 stations were opened and the underground extends to Sofia Airport on its Northern branch and to Business Park Sofia on its Southern branch. On July 2016 the Vitosha Metro Station was opened on the M2 main line. A third line is currently under construction and is expected to be finished in the second half of 2019. This line will complete the proposed underground system of three lines with about 65 km (40 mi) of lines. The master plan for the Sofia Metro includes three lines with a total of 63 stations. Marshrutkas provide an efficient and popular means of transport by being faster than public transport, but cheaper than taxis. There are around 13,000 taxi cabs operating in the city. Additionally, all-electric vehicles are available through carsharing company Spark, which is set to increase its fleet to 300 cars by mid-2019.\n\nPrivate automobile ownership has grown rapidly in the 1990s; more than 1,000,000 cars were registered in Sofia after 2002. The city has the 4th-highest number of automobiles per capita in the European Union at 546.4 vehicles per 1,000 people. The municipality was known for minor and cosmetic repairs and many streets are in a poor condition. This is noticeably changing in the past years. There are different boulevards and streets in the city with a higher amount of traffic than others. These include Tsarigradsko shose, Cherni Vrah, Bulgaria, Slivnitsa and Todor Aleksandrov boulevards, as well as the city's ring road, where long chains of cars are formed at peak hours and traffic jams occur regularly. Consequently, traffic and air pollution problems have become more severe and receive regular criticism in local media. The extension of the underground system is hoped to alleviate the city's immense traffic problems.\nSofia has an extensive district heating system based around four combined heat and power (CHP) plants and boiler stations. Virtually the entire city (900,000 households and 5,900 companies) is centrally heated, using residual heat from electricity generation (3,000 MW) and gas- and oil-fired heating furnaces; total heat capacity is 4,640 MW. The heat distribution piping network is 900 km (559 mi) long and comprises 14,000 substations and 10,000 heated buildings.\n\n\n== Education and science ==\n\nMuch of Bulgaria's educational capacity is concentrated in Sofia. There are 221 general, 11 special and seven arts or sports schools, 56 vocational gymnasiums and colleges, and four independent colleges. The city also hosts 23 of Bulgaria's 51 higher education establishments and more than 105,000 university students. The American College of Sofia, a private secondary school with roots in a school founded by American missionaries in 1860, is among the oldest American educational institutions outside of the United States.A number of secondary language schools provide education in a selected foreign language. These include the First English Language School, 91st German Language School, 164th Spanish Language School, and the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais. These are among the most sought-after secondary schools, along with Vladislav the Grammarian 72nd Secondary School and the High School of Mathematics, which topped the 2018 preference list for high school candidates.Higher education includes four of the five highest-ranking national universities \u2013 Sofia University (SU), the Technical University of Sofia, New Bulgarian University and the Medical University of Sofia. Sofia University was founded in 1888. More than 20,000 students study in its 16 faculties. A number of research and cultural departments operate within SU, including its own publishing house, botanical gardens, a space research centre, a quantum electronics department, and a Confucius Institute. Rakovski Defence and Staff College, the National Academy of Arts, the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy, the University of National and World Economy and the University of Mining and Geology are other major higher education establishments in the city.Other institutions of national significance, such as the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) and the SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library are located in Sofia. BAS is the centrepiece of scientific research in Bulgaria, employing more than 4,500 scientists in various institutes. Its Institute of Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy will operate the largest cyclotron in the country. All five of Bulgaria's supercomputers and supercomputing clusters are located in Sofia as well. Three of those are operated by the BAS; one by Sofia Tech Park and one by the Faculty of Physics at Sofia University.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nSofia is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Cooperation agreements ===\nIn addition Sofia has co-operation agreements with:\n\n\n== Honour ==\nSerdica Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Serdica.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches in Sofia\nList of shopping malls in Sofia\nList of tallest buildings in Sofia\nSofia Province\nMonument to the Tsar Liberator\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\"Sofia in Figures\" (PDF) (in Bulgarian and English).

        "wiki": "The Saint Sofia Church (Bulgarian: \u0446\u044a\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u201e\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f\u201c, tsyrkva \u201eSveta Sofia\u201c) is the oldest church in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, dating to the 4th century. In the predecessor building took place the Council of Serdica held most probably in 343 and attended by 316 bishops. In the 14th century, the church gave its name to the city, previously known as Sredets (\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0446).\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\nThe church was built on the site of several earlier churches from 4th c. and places of worship dating back to the days when it was the necropolis of the Roman town of Serdica. In the 2nd century, it was the location of a Roman theatre. Over the next few centuries, several other churches were constructed, only to be destroyed by invading forces such as the Goths and the Huns. The basic cross design of the present basilica, with its two east towers and one tower-cupola, is believed to be the fifth structure to be constructed on the site and was built during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in the middle of the 6th century (527-565). It is thus a contemporary of the better-known Hagia Sophia church in Constantinople.\nDuring the Second Bulgarian Empire (spanning the 12th to 14th centuries), the structure acquired the status of a metropolitan church. In the 14th century, the church gave its name to the city. In the 16th century, during Ottoman rule, the church was converted into a mosque: the original 12th-century frescoes were destroyed and minarets were added. In the 19th century, two earthquakes destroyed one of the minarets and the mosque was abandoned. Restoration work was begun after 1900.\nThe Saint Sofia Church is now one of the most valuable pieces of Early Christian architecture in Southeastern Europe. The present building is a cross basilica with three altars. The floor of the church is covered with complex Early Christian ornamental or flora and fauna-themed mosaics. The Saint Sofia Church stands in the middle of an ancient necropolis and many tombs have been unearthed both under and near the church. Some of the tombs even feature frescoes.\nBecause Saint Sophia represents Holy Wisdom, icons within the church depict Sophia as Christ Emmanuel, a young figure of Christ seated on a rainbow.  The church also displays icons of historical saints, including St. George and St. Vladimir.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Sofia\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\"\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f\". \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0410-\u042f (in Bulgarian). \u0411\u0410\u041d, \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434, \u0421\u0438\u0440\u043c\u0430. 2002.

Sveta Nedelya is a medieval church that has suffered destruction through the ages and has been reconstructed many times. The present building of the temple is among the landmarks of Sofia. It was designed by the famous Bulgarian architectural team Vasilyov-Tsolov.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the cathedral's earliest years is to a large extent unknown. It was probably built in the 10th century and had stone foundations and an otherwise wooden construction, remaining wooden until the middle of the 19th century, unlike most other churches in the city. A German traveller by the name of Stephan Gerlach visited Sofia in 1578 and mentioned the church.\n\nAround 1460, the remains of Serbian king Stefan Milutin were carried to Bulgaria and were stored in various churches and monasteries until being transferred to St Nedelya after it became a bishop's residence in the 18th century. With some interruptions, the remains have been preserved in the church ever since and the church acquired another name, Holy King (\u201e\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u043b\u201c, \u201eSveti Kral\u201c), in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nThe former building was demolished to make place for a larger and more imposing cathedral on 25 April 1856. The construction of the 35.5 m-long and 19 m-wide church began in the summer of the same year. The still incomplete building suffered from an earthquake in 1858, which prolonged the construction works that ultimately finished in 1863. It was officially inaugurated on 11 May 1867 in the presence of 20,000 people. A new belfry was erected to accommodate the 8 bells given to the church as a present by Russian Knyaz (Prince) Alexander Mikhailovich Dondukov-Korsakov in 1879.\nThe church was renovated in 1898, with new domes being added. Exarch Joseph I of Bulgaria was buried immediately outside the walls of St Nedelya in 1915. The church was razed in the assault in 1925 that claimed over 150 victims. After the assault, the church was restored to its modern appearance between the summer of 1927 and the spring of 1933 (once again inaugurated on 7 April 1933). It was almost erected anew as a temple 30 m in length and 15.50 m in width and featuring a central dome that made it 31 m high. The gilt iconostasis that survived the bomb attack was returned to the church.\nThe mural decoration was done by a team led by Nikolay Rostovtsev between 1971 and 1973. The floor was renovated and the north colonnade was glazed between 1992 and 1994. The fa\u00e7ade was cleaned thoroughly in 2000 and a device to automatically ring the eleven bells (the eight ones from Knyaz Dondukov-Korsakov, two made in Serbia and one cast in Bulgaria)\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe origin of the name Sveta Nedelya is rather obscure. It can be translated as either \"Holy Sunday\", \"Saint Nedelya\", or even as \"Saint Sunday\", depending on which etymology is taken as the basis. According  to the Bulgarian Orthodox website pravoslavieto.com, the church was noted by a German traveller, Stephan Gerlach, in 1578, as being known by several names, among which \"The Lord's Church\" (Bulgarian: Gospodnya Tsurkva) and \"Jesus Christ Church\" (Tsurkva Isus Hristos) but, more importantly, by the Greek name Kyriaki, a word literally meaning \"Sunday\", but which itself derives from Kyrios \u2013 \"Lord\" (i.e. Sunday, or Kyriaki = \"The Lord's Day\" and hence \"The Lord's Church\"). Furthermore, Kyriaki is also the name of a third-century Christian martyr \u2013 Saint Kyriaki, known in Bulgarian as Sveta Nedelya (Nedelya = \"Sunday\"). So, even though today the meaning appears to refer to the holiness of the day of Sunday, it may have originally referred to the young martyr Saint Kyriaki, or ultimately to Jesus Christ.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Sofia\n\n\n== References ==\nTsarkoven vestnik.

It is today the official residence of former Tsar Simeon II of Bulgaria and his wife Margarita. While the Royal Palace in the centre of Sofia (today the National Art Gallery and National Ethnographic Museum) served representative purposes and the Euxinograd Palace near Varna was a summer residence, Vrana was the palace where the royal family of Bulgaria spent most of their time. Vrana Palace is situated at an elevation of 571 m.It includes the site of Chardakli farm, where there was a bridge which featured in the liberation of Sofia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe extensive lot was bought by Tsar Ferdinand I in 1898 and is situated just outside Sofia. There is a large park and two buildings, the first one built in 1904 as a two-story hunting lodge commissioned to Georgi Fingov, and the second constructed mainly between 1909 and 1914 as a palace, both with money from the state budget. The earliest building in the complex, the hunting lodge, has been described architecturally as an \"exquisite interpretation of the Plovdiv baroque with Viennese decorative elements\".Three rooms of the three-storey palace commissioned to the noted architect Nikola Lazarov were later furnished in the Baroque style, one in the style of the Austrian royal palaces and one in a Bulgarian national style, while the study was designed in a Venetian style. The palace features a carved wooden ceiling, oak wainscoting, built-in metal plates and Delftware. The interior columns are made of Carrara marble and an old Schindler lift is still in use. In terms of architecture, the Vrana Palace combines Byzantine influences, Bulgarian National Revival traditions, Art Nouveau and French classicism.The Karelian Hall is a gift from Alexander III of Russia, and all of its furniture (the table, the chairs and the dressing table) are made of Karelian birch by master woodworkers specially sent from Russia. The first storey also has a cinema hall and tea halls, the second storey is where the apartments are located, and the third one used to be allocated to the servants and the court.\nIn 1918 Vrana passed from Tsar Ferdinand to Boris III. Here he faced the new government after the military coup on 9 June 1923. In August 1943, it became the property of Simeon II. The main palace was bombed by the RAF in 1943\u20131944 during World War II, and, after being partially damaged, it was subsequently restored in 1947. After the abolition of the monarchy, Vrana was taken by the communists and became a residence of Georgi Dimitrov.\nAfter the fall of the communist regime, Vrana was returned to the last tsar, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and his sister Princess Maria Luisa, by the Constitutional Court of Bulgaria in June 1998, and the park was donated by the royal family to the city of Sofia in October 1999, making it possible for the former royal park, arranged in 1903 by Ferdinand, to be opened to the public. Simeon moved with his wife Margarita into the renovated old hunting lodge in spring 2001. As of 2015, the 0.968-square-kilometre park is opened to the public. The park is home to over 400 plant species and has been declared a national monument of landscape architecture. Among the landscape artists who have worked on the Vrana Park include V. Georgiev, K. Baykushev, Jules Locheau, Johann Kellerer, Anton Kraus, Alaricus Delmard and Wilhelm Schacht. The park includes a lake and several rock gardens.The palace, along with the other properties given back to Simeon II, has been the subject of much controversy in the Bulgarian media and society in the 2000s, as many argue they are in fact supposed to be public property. Since June 2013, the park has been opened to the public on weekends. The special public transport bus 505, which only runs on weekends during the park's opening hours, connects the palace with Eagles' Bridge.\n\n\n== External links ==\nGoogle Earth view\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== General references ===\nIliev, Dimitar; Bozhidar Dimitrov (12 May 2006). \"Not a single royal lev for the construction of Vrana\" (in Bulgarian).

        "wiki": "Sofia ( SOH-fee-\u0259, SOF-; Bulgarian: \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, romanized: Sofiya, IPA: [\u02c8s\u0254fij\u0250] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. The city is at the foot of Vitosha mountain in the western part of the country. Being in the centre of the Balkans, it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, and closest to the Aegean Sea.Sofia is the 13th largest city in the European Union. It is surrounded by mountains, such as Vitosha by the southern side, Lyulin by the western side, and the Balkan Mountains by the north, which makes it the second highest European capital after Madrid. The city is built on the Iskar river, and has many mineral springs, such as the Sofia Central Mineral Baths. It has a humid continental climate. Being Bulgaria's primate city, Sofia is home of many of the major local universities, cultural institutions and commercial companies. The city has been described as the \"triangle of religious tolerance\". This is due to the fact that three colossal temples of the three world major religions\u2014Christianity, Islam and Judaism\u2014reside inside the borders of the city, which are the Sveta Nedelya Church, Banya Bashi Mosque and Sofia Synagogue.  \nSofia has been named one of the top ten best places for start-up businesses in the world, especially in information technologies. Sofia was Europe's most affordable capital to visit in 2013. In 1979, the Boyana Church in Sofia was included onto the World Heritage List, and it was deconstructed in the Second Bulgarian Empire, holding much patrimonial symbolism to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. With its cultural significance in Eastern Europe, Sofia is home to the National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria, the National Palace of Culture, the Vasil Levski National Stadium, the Ivan Vazov National Theatre, the National Archaeological Museum, and the Serdica Amphitheatre. The Museum of Socialist Art includes many sculptures and posters that educate visitors about the lifestyle in communist Bulgaria.The population of Sofia declined from 70,000 in the late 18th century, through 19,000 in 1870, to 11,649 in 1878, after which it began increasing. Sofia hosts some 1.23 million residents within a territory of 492 km2, a concentration of 17.5% of the country population within the 200th percentile of the country territory. The urban area of Sofia hosts some 1.54 million residents within 5723 km\u00b2, which comprises Sofia City Province and parts of Sofia Province (Dragoman, Slivnitsa, Kostinbrod, Bozhurishte, Svoge, Elin Pelin, Gorna Malina, Ihtiman, Kostenets) and Pernik Province (Pernik, Radomir), representing 5.16% of the country territory. The metropolitan area of Sofia is based upon one hour of car travel time, stretches internationally and includes Dimitrovgrad in Serbia. Unlike most European metropolitan areas, it is not to be defined as a substantially functional metropolitan area, but is of the type with \"limited variety of functions\". The metropolitan region of Sofia is inhabited by a population of 1.68 million and is made up of the whole provinces Sofia City, Sofia and Pernik, comprising more than 10,000 km\u00b2.\n\n\n== Names ==\n\nFor the longest time the city possessed a Thracian name, Serdica, derived from the tribe Serdi, who were either of Thracian, Celtic, or mixed Thracian-Celtic origin. The emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus (53 \u2013 117 AD) gave the city the combinative name of Ulpia Serdica; Ulpia may be derived from an Umbrian cognate of the Latin word lupus, meaning \"wolf\" or from the Latin vulpes (fox).\nIt seems that the first written mention of Serdica was made during his reign and the last mention was in the 19th century in a Bulgarian text (\u0421\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0456\u0438, Sardaki). Other names given to Sofia, such as Serdonpolis (\u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, \"City of the Serdi\" in Greek) and Triaditza (\u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b6\u03b1, \"Trinity\" in Greek), were mentioned by Byzantine Greek sources or coins. The Slavic name Sredets (\u0421\u0440\u0463\u0434\u0435\u0446\u044a), which is related to \"middle\" (\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430, \"sreda\") and to the city's earliest name, first appeared on paper in an 11th-century text. The city was called Atralisa by the Arab traveller Idrisi and Strelisa, Stralitsa or Stralitsion by the Crusaders.The name Sofia comes from the Saint Sofia Church, as opposed to the prevailing Slavic origin of Bulgarian cities and towns. The origin is in the Greek word sophia (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1) \"wisdom\". The earliest works where this latest name is registered are the duplicate of the Gospel of Serdica, in a dialogue between two salesmen from Dubrovnik around 1359, in the 14th-century Vitosha Charter of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman and in a Ragusan merchant's notes of 1376. In these documents the city is called Sofia, but at the same time the region and the city's inhabitants are still called Sredecheski (\u0441\u0440\u0463\u0434\u0435\u0447\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0438, \"of Sredets\"), which continued until the 20th century. The Ottomans came to favour the name Sofya (\u0635\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0647). In 1879 there was a dispute about what the name of the new Bulgarian capital should be, when the citizens created a committee of famous people, insisting for the Slavic name. Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of Sofia for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title Sredets for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSofia City Province has an area of 1344 km2, while the surrounding and much bigger Sofia Province is 7,059 km2. Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the Balkans. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the Sofia Valley that is surrounded by the Balkan mountains to the north. The valley has an average altitude of 550 metres (1,800 ft). Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three mountain passes lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between Black and Aegean Seas.\nA number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the Boyanska, Vladayska and Perlovska. The Iskar River in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in Rila, Bulgaria's highest mountain, and enters Sofia Valley near the village of German. The Iskar flows north toward the Balkan Mountains, passing between the eastern city suburbs, next to the main building and below the runways of Sofia Airport, and flows out of the Sofia Valley at the town of Novi Iskar, where the scenic Iskar Gorge begins.The city is known for its 49 mineral and thermal springs. Artificial and dam lakes were built in the twentieth century.\n\nWhile the 1818 and 1858 earthquakes were intense and destructive, the 2012 Pernik earthquake occurred west of Sofia with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a much lower Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). The 2014 Aegean Sea earthquake was also noticed in the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSofia has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb; Cfb if with \u22123 \u00b0C isotherm) with an average annual temperature of 10.4 \u00b0C (50.7 \u00b0F).\nWinters are relatively cold and snowy. In the coldest days temperatures can drop below \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), most notably in January. The lowest recorded temperature is \u221231.2 \u00b0C (\u221224 \u00b0F) (16 January 1893). Fog is not unusual, especially in the beginning of the season. On average, Sofia receives a total snowfall of 96 cm (37.8 in) and 58 days with snow cover. The snowiest recorded winter was 1995/1996 with a total snowfall of 171 cm (67.3 in). The record snow depth is 57 cm (22.4 in) (25 December 2001). The coldest recorded month was January 1942 with an average temperature of \u22129.3 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F), while the coldest year on record was 1940 with an annual temperature of 8.3 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F).Summers are quite warm and sunny. In summer, the city generally remains slightly cooler than other parts of Bulgaria, due to its higher altitude. However, the city is also subjected to heat waves with high temperatures reaching or exceeding 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) in the hottest days, particularly in July and August. The highest recorded temperature is 41 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) (5 July 2000 and 24 July 2007). The hottest recorded month was July 2012 with an average temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). The warmest year on record was 2019 with an annual temperature of 11.9 \u00b0C (53 \u00b0F).Springs and autumns in Sofia are usually short with variable and dynamic weather.\nThe city receives an average precipitation of 581.8 mm (22.91 in) a year, reaching its peak in late spring and early summer when thunderstorms are common. The driest recorded year was 2000 with a total precipitation of 304.6 mm (11.99 in), while the wettest year on record was 2014 with a total precipitation of 1,066.6 mm (41.99 in).\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nThe geographic position of the Sofia Valley limits the flow of air masses, increasing the chances of air pollution by particulate matter and nitrogen oxide. Solid fuel used for heating and motor vehicle traffic are significant sources of pollutants. Smog thus persists over the city as temperature inversions and the mountains surrounding the city prevent the circulation of air masses. As a result, air pollution levels in Sofia are some of the highest in Europe.Particulate matter concentrations are consistently above the norm. During the October 2017 \u2013 March 2018 heating season, particulate levels exceeded the norm on 70 occasions; on 7 January 2018, PM10 levels reached 632 \u00b5g/m3, some twelve times the EU norm of 50 \u00b5g/m3. Even areas with few sources of air pollution, like Gorna Banya, had PM2.5 and PM10 levels above safe thresholds. In response to hazardous spikes in air pollution, the Municipal Council implemented a variety of measures in January 2018, like more frequent washing of streets. However, a report by the European Court of Auditors issued in September 2018 revealed that Sofia has not drafted any projects to reduce air pollution from heating. The report also noted that no industrial pollution monitoring stations operate in Sofia, even though industrial facilities are active in the city. A monitoring station on Eagles' Bridge, where some of the highest particulate matter values were measured, was moved away from the location and has measured sharply lower values since then. Particulates are now largely measured by a network of 300 sensors maintained by volunteers since 2017. The European Commission has taken Bulgaria to court over its failure to curb air pollution.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nSofia has been an area of continuous human habitation since at least the 30th millennium BC. The city itself has a history of nearly 7000 years, with the great attraction of the hot water springs that still flow abundantly in the centre of the city. The neolithic village in Slatina dating to the 5th\u20136th millennium BC is documented. Remains from another neolithic settlement around the National Art Gallery are traced to the 3rd\u20134th millennium BC, which has been the traditional centre of the city ever since.The earliest tribes who settled were the Thracian Tilataei. \nIn the 500s BC, the area became part of a Thracian state union, the Odrysian kingdom from another Thracian tribe the Odrysses. For a short period Thracian rule was possibly interrupted by the Achaemenid Empire.\nIn 339 BC Philip II of Macedon destroyed and ravaged the town for the first time.The Celtic tribe Serdi gave their name to the city. The earliest mention of the city comes from an Athenian inscription from the 1st century BC, attesting Astiu ton Serdon, i.e. city of the Serdi. The inscription and Dio Cassius told that the Roman general Crassus subdued the Serdi and behanded the captives.In 27\u201329 BC, according do Dio Cassius, Pliny and Ptolemy, the region \"Segetike\" was attacked by Crassus, which is assumed to be Serdica, or the city of the Serdi. The ancient city is located between TZUM, Sheraton Hotel and the Presidency. It gradually became the most important Roman city of the region. It became a municipium during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98\u2013117). Serdica expanded, as turrets, protective walls, public baths, administrative and cult buildings, a civic basilica, an amphitheatre, a circus, the City council (Boul\u00e9), a large forum, a big circus (theatre), etc. were built. Serdica was a significant city on the Roman road Via Militaris, connecting Singidunum and Byzantium. In the 3rd century, it became the capital of Dacia Aureliana, and when Emperor Diocletian divided the province of Dacia Aureliana into Dacia Ripensis (at the banks of the Danube) and Dacia Mediterranea, Serdica became the capital of the latter. Serdica's citizens of Thracian descent were referred to as Illyrians probably because it was at some time the capital of Eastern Illyria (Second Illyria).Roman emperors Aurelian (215\u2013275) and Galerius (260\u2013311) were born in Serdica.\nThe city expanded and became a significant political and economical centre, more so as it became one of the first Roman cities where Christianity was recognised as an official religion (under Galerius). The Edict of Toleration by Galerius was issued in 311 in Serdica by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity. The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of \"religio licita\", a worship recognised and accepted by the Roman Empire. It was the first edict legalising Christianity, preceding the Edict of Milan by two years.\nFor Constantine the Great it was 'Sardica mea Roma est' (Serdica is my Rome). He considered making Serdica the capital of the Byzantine Empire instead of Constantinople. which was already not dissimilar to a tetrarchic capital of the Roman Empire. In 343 AD, the Council of Sardica was held in the city, in a church located where the current 6th century Church of Saint Sophia was later built.\nThe city was destroyed in the 447 invasion of the Huns and the city laid in ruins for a century It was rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. During the reign of Justinian it flourished, being surrounded with great fortress walls whose remnants can still be seen today.\n\n\n==== Archaeology ====\nMany remains of the ancient city have been excavated and are on public display today. These include:\n\nComplex Ancient Serdica\neastern gate\nwestern gate\ncity walls\nthermal baths\nbridge over the river\n4th c. church of St. George Rotunda\namphitheatre of Serdica\nthe tombs and basilicas under the basilica of St. Sophia\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe city first became part of the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Krum in 809, after a long siege. Afterw\u0430rds, it grew into an important fortress and administrative centre when Khan Omurtag made it a centre of Sredets province (Sredetski komitat, \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442). After the conquest of the Bulgarian capital Preslav by Sviatoslav I of Kiev and John I Tzimiskes' armies in 970\u2013971, the Bulgarian Patriarch Damyan chose Sofia for his seat in the next year and the capital of Bulgaria was first moved to Sredets. In the second half of 10th century the city was ruled by Komit Nikola and his sons, popular as \"Komitopuli\". One of them is Samuil, who became an Emperor of Bulgaria in 997. After a number of unsuccessful sieges, the city fell to the Byzantine Empire in 1018, but once again was incorporated into the restored Bulgarian Empire at the time of Tsar Ivan Asen I.\n\n\n=== Early modern history ===\nIn 1385, Sofia was seized by the Ottoman Empire in the course of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars. Around 1393 it became the seat of newly established Sanjak of Sofia.The city was occupied by Hungarian forces for a short time in 1443. After the failed crusade of W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland in 1443 towards Sofia, the city's Christian faced persecution and the city became the capital of the Ottoman province (beylerbeylik) of Rumelia for more than four centuries. During that time Sofia was the largest import-export-base in modern-day Bulgaria for the caravan trade with the Republic of Ragusa. In the 15th and 16th century, Sofia was expanded by Ottoman building activity. Public investments in infrastructure, education and local economy brought greater diversity to the city. Amongst others, the population consisted of Muslims, Bulgarian and Greek speaking Orthodox Christians, Armenians, Georgians, Catholic Ragusans, Jews (Romaniote, Ashkenazi and Sephardi), and Romani people.\n\nWhen it comes to the cityscape, 16th century sources mention eight Friday Mosques, three public libraries, numerous schools, 12 churches, three synagogues, and the largest bedesten (market) of the Balkans. Additionally, there were fountains and hammams (bathhouses). Some prominent churches such as Saint Sofia had been converted into mosques. In total there were 11 big and over 100 small mosques by the 17th century, of which only the Banya Bashi remains as a mosque today.\nThe town was seized for several weeks by Bulgarian hajduks in 1599. In 1610 the Vatican established the See of Sofia for Catholics of Rumelia, which existed until 1715 when most Catholics had emigrated. The town was the centre of Sofia Eyalet (1826\u20131864). Nedelya Petkova created the first Bulgarian school for women in the city. In 1873 the Ottomans hanged in Sofia the Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski.\n\n\n=== Modern and contemporary history ===\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378, Suleiman Pasha threatened to burn the city in defence, but the foreign diplomats Leandre Legay, Vito Positano, Rabbi Gabriel Almosnino and Josef Valdhart refused to leave the city thus saving it. Many Bulgarian residents of Sofia armed themselves and sided with the Russian forces. Sofia was relieved (see Battle of Sofia) from Ottoman rule by Russian forces under Gen. Iosif Gurko on 4 January 1878. It was proposed as a capital by Marin Drinov and was accepted as such on 3 April 1879. By the time of its liberation the population of the city was 11,649.Most mosques in Sofia were destroyed in that war, seven of them destroyed in one night in December 1878 when a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers. Following the war, the great majority of the Muslim population left Sofia.For a few decades after the liberation, Sofia experienced large population growth, mainly by migration from other regions of the Principality (Kingdom since 1908) of Bulgaria, and from the still Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace.\nIn 1900, the first electric lightbulb in the city was turned on.In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria was fighting alone practically all of its neighbouring countries. When the Romanian Army entered Vrazhdebna in 1913, then a village 11 kilometres (7 miles) from Sofia, now a suburb, this prompted the Tsardom of Bulgaria to capitulate.\nIn 1925, a terrorist act of ultra-leftists failed their attempted assassination of the king but resulted in the destruction of the Saint Nedelya Church and many victims.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bulgaria declared war on the US and UK on 13 December 1941 and in late 1943 and early 1944 the US and UK Air forces conducted bombings over Sofia. As a consequence of the bombings thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged including the Capital Library and thousands of books. In 1944 Sofia and the rest of Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and within days of the Soviet invasion Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany.\nIn 1945, the communist Fatherland Front took power. The transformations of Bulgaria into the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1946 and into the Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 marked significant changes in the city's appearance. The population of Sofia expanded rapidly due to migration from rural regions. New residential areas were built in the outskirts of the city, like Druzhba, Mladost and Lyulin.\nDuring the Communist Party rule, a number of the city's most emblematic streets and squares were renamed for ideological reasons, with the original names restored after 1989.The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum, where Dimitrov's body had been preserved in a similar way to the Lenin mausoleum, was demolished in 1999.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nIn Sofia there are 607,473 dwellings and 101,696 buildings. According to modern records, 39,551 dwellings were constructed until 1949, 119,943 between 1950 and 1969, 287,191 between 1970 and 1989, 57,916 in the 90s and 102,623 between 2000 and 2011. Until 1949, 13,114 buildings were constructed and between 10,000\u201320,000 in each following decade. Sofia's architecture combines a wide range of architectural styles, some of which are aesthetically incompatible. These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgar fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century Rotunda of St. George, the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved Amphitheatre of Serdica.\nAfter the Liberation War, knyaz Alexander Battenberg invited architects from Austria\u2013Hungary to shape the new capital's architectural appearance.Among the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were Friedrich Gr\u00fcnanger, Adolf V\u00e1clav Kol\u00e1\u0159, and Viktor Rumpelmayer, who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country's elite. Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia's centre is thus a combination of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Rococo, Neo-Renaissance and Neoclassicism, with the Vienna Secession also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.\nAfter World War II and the establishment of a Communist government in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. Stalinist Gothic public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around The Largo, Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete tower blocks, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of Brutalist architecture.\nAfter the abolition of Communism in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skryscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The 126-metre (413 ft) Capital Fort Business Centre is the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with its 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.\n\nArchitectural styles in Sofia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Green areas ===\n\nThe city has an extensive green belt. Some of the neighbourhoods constructed after 2000 are densely built up and lack green spaces. There are four principal parks \u2013 Borisova gradina in the city centre and the Southern, Western and Northern parks. Several smaller parks, among which the Zaimov Park, City Garden and the Doctors' Garden, are located in central Sofia. The Vitosha Nature Park (the oldest national park in the Balkans) includes most of Vitosha mountain and covers an area of 266 square kilometres (103 sq mi), with roughly half of it lying within the municipality of Sofia. Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter and during the 70s and the 80s multiple ski slopes of various difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski area has been left to decay in the last 10 years so that currently there is only one chairlift and one slope working.\n\n\n== Government and law ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nSofia Municipality is identical to Sofia City Province, which is distinct from Sofia Province, which surrounds but does not include the capital itself. Besides the city proper, the 24 districts of Sofia Municipality encompass three other towns and 34 villages. Districts and settlements have their own governor who is elected in a popular election. The assembly members are chosen every four years. The common head of Sofia Municipality and all the 38 settlements is the mayor of Sofia. The current mayor Yordanka Fandakova is serving a third consecutive term, having won the 2015 election at first round with 238,500 votes, or 60.2% of the vote, when Reformist Bloc opponent Vili Lilkov was second with 9.6%; the turnout was 41.25%. Some party leaders claimed that ballots were falsified and called for annulment of the election. A precedent happened, due to the suspicion, as a preventative action between 300 and 5000 people and counters had been locked inside Arena Armeets against their will for two days, following which the director of the Electoral Commission of Sofia resigned at the request of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.\n\n\n=== National government ===\nSofia is the seat of the executive (Council of Ministers), legislative (National Assembly) and judiciary (Supreme Court and Constitutional Court) bodies of Bulgaria, as well as all government agencies, ministries, the National Bank, and the delegation of the European Commission. The President, along with the Council of Ministers, is located on Independence Square, also known as The Largo or The Triangle of Power. One of the three buildings in the architectural ensemble, the former Bulgarian Communist Party headquarters, is due to become the seat of the Parliament. A refurbishment project is due to be completed in mid-2019, while the old National Assembly building will become a museum or will only host ceremonial political events.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nUnder Bulgaria's centralised political system, Sofia concentrates much of the political and financial resources of the country. It is the only city in Bulgaria to host three electoral constituencies: the 23rd, 24th and 25th Multi-member Constituencies, which together field 42 mandates in the 240-member National Assembly.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nWith a murder rate of 1.7/per 100.000 people (as of 2009) Sofia is a quite safe capital city. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, crimes, including Bulgarian mafia killings, caused problems in the city, where authorities had difficulties convicting the actors, which had caused the European Commission to warn the Bulgarian government that the country would not be able to join the EU unless it curbed crime (Bulgaria eventually joined in 2007). Many of the most severe crimes are contract killings connected to the organised crime, but these had dropped in recent years after several arrests of gang members. Corruption in Bulgaria also affects Sofia's authorities. According to the director of Sofia District Police Directorate, the largest share of the crimes are thefts, making up 62.4% of all crimes in the capital city. Increasing are frauds, drug-related crimes, petty theft and vandalism. According to a survey, almost a third of Sofia's residents say that they never feel safe in the Bulgarian capital, while 20% always feel safe. As of 2015, the consumer-reported perceived crime risk on the Numbeo database was \"high\" for theft and vandalism and \"low\" for violent crimes; safety while walking during daylight was rated \"very high\", and \"moderate\" during the night. With 1,600 prisoners, the incarceration rate is above 0.1%; however, roughly 70% of all prisoners are part of the Romani minority.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts and entertainment ===\n\nSofia concentrates the majority of Bulgaria's leading performing arts troupes. Theatre is by far the most popular form of performing art, and theatrical venues are among the most visited, second only to cinemas. There were 3,162 theatric performances with 570,568 people attending in 2014. The Ivan Vazov National Theatre, which performs mainly classical plays and is situated in the very centre of the city, is the most prominent theatre. The National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria is a combined opera and ballet collective established in 1891. Regular performances began in 1909. Some of Bulgaria's most famous operatic singers, such as Nicolai Ghiaurov and Ghena Dimitrova, made their first appearances on the stage of the National Opera and Ballet.\nCinema is the most popular form of entertainment: there were more than 141,000 film shows with a total attendance exceeding 2,700,000 in 2014. Over the past two decades, numerous independent cinemas have closed and most shows are in shopping centre multiplexes. Odeon (not part of the Odeon Cinemas chain) shows exclusively European and independent American films, as well as 20th century classics. The Boyana Film studios was at the centre of a once-thriving domestic film industry, which declined significantly after 1990. Nu Image acquired the studios to upgrade them into Nu Boyana Film Studios, used to shoot scenes for a number of action movies like The Expendables 2, Rambo: Last Blood and London Has Fallen.\n\nBulgaria's largest art museums are located in the central areas of the city. Since 2015, the National Art Gallery, the National Gallery for Foreign Art (NGFA) and the Museum of Contemporary Art \u2013 Sofia Arsenal were merged to form the National Gallery. Its largest branch is Kvadrat 500, located on the NFGA premises, where some 2,000 works are on display in twenty eight exhibition halls. The collections encompass diverse cultural items, from Ashanti Empire sculptures and Buddhist art to Dutch Golden Age painting, works by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Auguste Rodin. The crypt of the Alexander Nevsky cathedral is another branch of the National Gallery. It holds a collection of Eastern Orthodox icons from the 9th to the 19th century.\nThe National History Museum, located in Boyana, it has a vast collection of more than 650,000 historical items dating from Prehistory to the modern era, although only 10,000 of them are permanently displayed due to the lack of space. Smaller collections of historical items are displayed in the National Archaeological Museum, a former mosque located between the edifices of the National Bank and the Presidency. Two natural sciences museums\u2014the Natural History Museum and Earth and Man\u2014display minerals, animal species (alive and taxidermic) and rare materials. The Ethnographic Museum and the Museum of Military History hold large collections of Bulgarian folk costumes and armaments, respectively. The Polytechnical Museum has more than 1,000 technological items on display. The SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library, the foremost information repository in the country, holds some 1,800,000 books and more than 7,000,000 documents, manuscripts, maps and other items.\n\nThe city houses many cultural institutes such as the Russian Cultural Institute, the Polish Cultural Institute, the Hungarian Institute, the Czech and the Slovak Cultural Institutes, the Italian Cultural Institute, Confucius Institute, Institut Fran\u00e7ais, Goethe Institut, British Council and Instituto Cervantes which regularly organise temporary expositions of visual, sound and literary works by artists from their respective countries.\n\nSome of the biggest telecommunications companies, TV and radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and web portals are based in Sofia, including the Bulgarian National Television, bTV and Nova TV. Top-circulation newspapers include 24 Chasa and Trud.\nThe Boyana Church, a UNESCO World Heritage site, contains realistic frescoes, depicting more than 240 human images and a total 89 scenes, were painted. With their vital, humanistic realism they are a Renaissance phenomenon at its culmination phase in the context of the common-European art.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nSofia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Bulgaria alongside coastal and mountain resorts. Among its highlights is the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, one of the symbols of Bulgaria, constructed in the late 19th century. It occupies an area of 3,170 square metres (34,122 square feet) and can hold 10,000 people.\nVitosha Boulevard, also called Vitoshka, is a pedestrian zone with numerous caf\u00e9s, restaurants, fashion boutiques, and luxury goods stores. Sofia's geographic location, in the foothills of the weekend retreat Vitosha mountain, further adds to the city's specific atmosphere.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nA large number of sports clubs are based in the city. During the Communist era, most sports clubs concentrated on all-round sporting development, therefore CSKA, Levski, Lokomotiv and Slavia are dominant not only in football, but in many other team sports as well. Basketball and volleyball also have strong traditions in Sofia. A notable local basketball team is twice European Champions Cup finalist Lukoil Akademik. The Bulgarian Volleyball Federation is the world's second-oldest, and it was an exhibition tournament organised by the BVF in Sofia that convinced the International Olympic Committee to include volleyball as an olympic sport in 1957. Tennis is increasingly popular in the city. Currently there are some ten tennis court complexes within the city including the one founded by former WTA top-five athlete Magdalena Maleeva.Sofia applied to host the Winter Olympic Games in 1992 and in 1994, coming second and third respectively. The city was also an applicant for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but was not selected as candidate. In addition, Sofia hosted EuroBasket 1957 and the 1961 and 1977 Summer Universiades, as well as the 1983 and 1989 winter editions. In 2012, it hosted the FIVB World League finals.\n\nThe city is home to a number of large sports venues, including the 43,000-seat Vasil Levski National Stadium which hosts international football matches, as well as the Georgi Asparuhov Stadium and Lokomotiv Stadium, the main venues for outdoor musical concerts. Armeets Arena holds many indoor events and has a capacity of up to 19,000 people depending on its use. The venue was inaugurated on 30 July 2011, and the first event it hosted was a friendly volleyball match between Bulgaria and Serbia. There are two ice skating complexes \u2014 the Winter Sports Palace with a capacity of 4,600 and the Slavia Winter Stadium with a capacity of 2,000, both containing two rinks each. A velodrome with 5,000 seats in the city's central park is currently undergoing renovation. There are also various other sports complexes in the city which belong to institutions other than football clubs, such as those of the National Sports Academy, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, or those of different universities. There are more than fifteen swimming complexes in the city, most of them outdoor. Nearly all of these were constructed as competition venues and therefore have seating facilities for several hundred people.\nThere are two golf courses just to the east of Sofia \u2014 in Elin Pelin (St Sofia club) and in Ihtiman (Air Sofia club), and a horseriding club (St George club).\nSofia was designated as European Capital of Sport in 2018. The decision was announced in November 2014 by the Evaluation Committee of ACES Europe, on the grounds that \"the city is a good example of sport for all, as means to improve healthy lifestyle, integration and education, which are the basis of the initiative.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nPopulation growth over the years (in thousands):\n\nAccording to 2018 data, the city has a population of 1,269,384 and the whole Sofia Capital Municipality of 1,328,120. The first census carried out in February 1878 by the Russian Army recorded a population of 11,694 inhabitants including 6,560 Bulgarians, 3,538 Jews, 839 Turks and 737 Romani.\nThe ratio of women per 1,000 men was 1,102. The birth rate per 1000 people was 12.3 per mille and steadily increasing in the last 5 years, the death rate reaching 12.1 per mille and decreasing. The natural growth rate during 2009 was 0.2 per mille, the first positive growth rate in nearly 20 years. The considerable immigration to the capital from poorer regions of the country, as well as urbanisation, are among the other reasons for the increase in Sofia's population. The infant mortality rate was 5.6 per 1,000, down from 18.9 in 1980. According to the 2011 census, people aged 20\u201324 years are the most numerous group, numbering 133,170 individuals and accounting for 11% of the total 1,202,761 people. The median age is 38 though. According to the census, 1,056,738 citizens (87.9%) are recorded as ethnic Bulgarians, 17,550 (1.5%) as Romani, 6,149 (0.5%) as Turks, 9,569 (0.8%) belonged to other ethnic groups, 6,993 (0.6%) do not self-identify and 105,762 (8.8%) remained with undeclared affiliation. This statistic should not necessarily be taken at face value due to conflicting data \u2013 such as for the predominantly Roma neighbourhood of Fakulteta, which alone may have a population of 45,000.According to the 2011 census, throughout the whole municipality some 892,511 people (69.1%) are recorded as Eastern Orthodox Christians, 10,256 (0.8%) as Protestant, 6,767 (0.5%) as Muslim, 5,572 (0.4%) as Roman Catholic, 4,010 (0.3%) belonged to other faith and 372,475 (28.8%) declared themselves irreligious or did not mention any faith. The data says that roughly a third of the total population have already earned a university degree. Of the population aged 15\u201364 \u2013 265,248 people within the municipality (28.5%) are not economically active, the unemployed being another group of 55,553 people (6%), a large share of whom have completed higher education. The largest group are occupied in trading, followed by those in manufacturing industry. Within the municipality, three-quarters, or 965,328 people are recorded as having access to television at home and 836,435 (64.8%) as having internet. Out of 464,865 homes \u2013 432,847 have connection to the communal sanitary sewer, while 2,732 do not have any. Of these 864 do not have any water supply and 688 have other than communal. Over 99.6% of males and females aged over 9 are recorded as literate. The largest group of the population aged over 20 are recorded to live within marriage (46.3%), another 43.8% are recorded as single and another 9.9% as having other type of coexistence/partnership, whereas not married in total are a majority and among people aged up to 40 and over 70. The people with juridical status divorced or widowed are either part of the factual singles or those having another type of partnership, each of the two constitutes by around 10% of the population aged over 20. Only over 1% of the juridically married do not de facto live within marriage. The families that consist of two people are 46.8%, another 34.2% of the families are made up by three people, whereas most of the households (36.5%) consist of only one person.Sofia was declared the national capital in 1879. One year later, in 1880, it was the fifth-largest city in the country after Plovdiv, Varna, Ruse and Shumen. Plovdiv remained the most populous Bulgarian town until 1892 when Sofia took the lead.  The city is the hot spot of internal migration, the capital population is increasing and is around 17% of the national, thus a small number of people with local roots remain today, they dominate the surrounding rural suburbs and are called Shopi. Shopi speak the Western Bulgarian dialects.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSofia is the economic hub of Bulgaria and home to most major Bulgarian and international companies operating in the country, the National Bank and the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. The city's GDP (PPS) per capita stood at \u20ac29,600 ($33,760) in 2015, one of the lowest for a capital region in the EU, but well above other cities in the country. Nominal GDP in 2014 was 32.8 billion leva ($19.1 billion) The average per capita annual income was 6,890 leva ($4,019) in 2014, and average monthly wages in June 2018 were $880, the highest nationally. Services dominate the economy, accounting for 85.9% of gross value added.In 2015, Forbes listed Sofia as one of the top 10 places in the world to launch a startup business, because of the low corporate tax (10%), the fast internet connection speeds available \u2013 one of the fastest in the world, and the presence of several investment funds, including Eleven Startup Accelerator, LAUNCHub and Neveq.Historically, after World War II and the era of industrialisation under socialism, the city and its surrounding areas expanded rapidly and became the most heavily industrialised region of the country. The influx of workers from other parts of the country became so intense that a restriction policy was imposed, and residing in the capital was only possible after obtaining Sofianite citizenship. However, after the political changes in 1989, this kind of citizenship was removed. In 2015, Globalization and World Cities Research Institute ranked Sofia as Beta- world city. As of 12 September 2018, Sofia is ranked among the 100 financial top centres worldwide.Up until 2007, Sofia experienced rapid economic growth. In 2008, apartment prices increased dramatically, with a growth rate of 30%.\nIn 2009, prices fell by 26%.In January 2015, Sofia was ranked 30th out of 300 global cities in terms of combined growth in employment and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2013\u20132014. This was the highest rank amongst cities in Southeast Europe. The real GDP (PPP) per capita growth was 2.5% to $33,105 (28,456 euro) and the employment went up by 3.4% to 962,400 in 2013\u20132014.\n\n\n== Transport and infrastructure ==\nWith its developing infrastructure and strategic location, Sofia is a major hub for international railway and automobile transport. Three of the ten Pan-European Transport Corridors cross the city: IV, VIII and X. All major types of transport (except water) are represented in the city.\n\nThe Central Railway Station is the primary hub for domestic and international rail transport, carried out by Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ), the national rail company headquartered in the city. It is one of the main stations along BDZ Line 1, and a hub of Lines 2, 5 and 13. Line 1 provides a connection to Plovdiv, the second-largest city in Bulgaria, while Line 2 is the longest national railway and connects Sofia and Varna, the largest coastal city. Lines 5 and 13 are shorter and provide connections to Kulata and Bankya, respectively. Overall, Sofia has 186 km (116 miles) of railway lines.Sofia Airport handled 6,962,040 passengers in 2018.Public transport is well-developed with bus (2,380 km (1,479 mi)), tram (308 km (191 mi)) and trolleybus (193 km (120 mi)) lines running in all areas of the city. The Sofia Metro became operational in 1998, and now has two lines and 34 stations. As of 2012, the system has 39 km (24 mi) of track. Six new stations were opened in 2009, two more in April 2012, and eleven more in August 2012. In 2015 new 7 stations were opened and the underground extends to Sofia Airport on its Northern branch and to Business Park Sofia on its Southern branch. On July 2016 the Vitosha Metro Station was opened on the M2 main line. A third line is currently under construction and is expected to be finished in the second half of 2019. This line will complete the proposed underground system of three lines with about 65 km (40 mi) of lines. The master plan for the Sofia Metro includes three lines with a total of 63 stations. Marshrutkas provide an efficient and popular means of transport by being faster than public transport, but cheaper than taxis. There are around 13,000 taxi cabs operating in the city. Additionally, all-electric vehicles are available through carsharing company Spark, which is set to increase its fleet to 300 cars by mid-2019.\n\nPrivate automobile ownership has grown rapidly in the 1990s; more than 1,000,000 cars were registered in Sofia after 2002. The city has the 4th-highest number of automobiles per capita in the European Union at 546.4 vehicles per 1,000 people. The municipality was known for minor and cosmetic repairs and many streets are in a poor condition. This is noticeably changing in the past years. There are different boulevards and streets in the city with a higher amount of traffic than others. These include Tsarigradsko shose, Cherni Vrah, Bulgaria, Slivnitsa and Todor Aleksandrov boulevards, as well as the city's ring road, where long chains of cars are formed at peak hours and traffic jams occur regularly. Consequently, traffic and air pollution problems have become more severe and receive regular criticism in local media. The extension of the underground system is hoped to alleviate the city's immense traffic problems.\nSofia has an extensive district heating system based around four combined heat and power (CHP) plants and boiler stations. Virtually the entire city (900,000 households and 5,900 companies) is centrally heated, using residual heat from electricity generation (3,000 MW) and gas- and oil-fired heating furnaces; total heat capacity is 4,640 MW. The heat distribution piping network is 900 km (559 mi) long and comprises 14,000 substations and 10,000 heated buildings.\n\n\n== Education and science ==\n\nMuch of Bulgaria's educational capacity is concentrated in Sofia. There are 221 general, 11 special and seven arts or sports schools, 56 vocational gymnasiums and colleges, and four independent colleges. The city also hosts 23 of Bulgaria's 51 higher education establishments and more than 105,000 university students. The American College of Sofia, a private secondary school with roots in a school founded by American missionaries in 1860, is among the oldest American educational institutions outside of the United States.A number of secondary language schools provide education in a selected foreign language. These include the First English Language School, 91st German Language School, 164th Spanish Language School, and the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais. These are among the most sought-after secondary schools, along with Vladislav the Grammarian 72nd Secondary School and the High School of Mathematics, which topped the 2018 preference list for high school candidates.Higher education includes four of the five highest-ranking national universities \u2013 Sofia University (SU), the Technical University of Sofia, New Bulgarian University and the Medical University of Sofia. Sofia University was founded in 1888. More than 20,000 students study in its 16 faculties. A number of research and cultural departments operate within SU, including its own publishing house, botanical gardens, a space research centre, a quantum electronics department, and a Confucius Institute. Rakovski Defence and Staff College, the National Academy of Arts, the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy, the University of National and World Economy and the University of Mining and Geology are other major higher education establishments in the city.Other institutions of national significance, such as the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) and the SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library are located in Sofia. BAS is the centrepiece of scientific research in Bulgaria, employing more than 4,500 scientists in various institutes. Its Institute of Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy will operate the largest cyclotron in the country. All five of Bulgaria's supercomputers and supercomputing clusters are located in Sofia as well.

          "A great little place with 3 floors of little shops. Each shop has something different to offer. Small bakery, bread stores, jewellery, stones/gems, traditional Bulgarian rope/ dolls, little supermarket upstairs and much more. Even at the end of a little shopping spree you can",
          "If your passing then definitely pop in here, small market selling fresh produce, touristy stuff and typical market wares. Nice for photography and there is a small bar/coffee shop in the middle if you need a rest.",
          "It's a small/medium sized market hall with plenty of shops with anything you might want. Checked the whole place out in just 20 minutes. Rested for an hour at a coffee shop at the middle of the market.",
          "Plenty of food (and souvenir) shops are here. There's a small supermarket upstairs. In the southeast corner on bottom floor, there is a small cafeteria that serves local food, at budget prices. After 1800, it's half price.",
          "Some weeks ago I had an extremely poor experience in Toska Cafe, situated in the middle of the Halite. All of the food, drinks and whipped cream in Toska Cafe are old and poor. Be very careful!! Never go there!! I took a coffee with whipped cream on the top and a cake. The",

          "A nice and very clean shopping -old fashioned place in Sofia-Bulgaria. Local products, food to take away, supermarket. The problem is we can not pay euro and cards",
          "We came here early morning, so it\u2019s pretty empty. But got this fresh banitsa (cheese pie) and yogurt drink. And it\u2019s pretty good :) Other than that, you\u2019ll see shops like souvenirs, cold cuts shops, jewellery, and many more other shops to offer. It doesn\u2019t like typical market",
          "Yes highly recommend great place to visit and maybe have lunch at a very reasonable price . If you\u2019re keen on doing a bit of shopping I think you could do that as well I was very impressed and had a good time . It\u2019s a little bit of a walk up the main Plaza but you just keep",

          "It is just a market hall but it is organized and clean! It has many souvenirs, in good prices, the first floor has a supermarket with many cosmetis (girls you will love them and their prices) and the last floor has a store with used clothes were you can find little diamonds! I",
          "Great Local market. Always worth finding the major market for whatever city you're visiting and going to get an idea of local flavours. Sofia market didn't disappoint. Clean, spacious and well laid out. Quite a few stalls for souvenirs but also some sausage and cheese stalls",
          "Located on Maria Louise Blvd, It was opened in 1911. its woth popping into just for a quick look around and sit down at the cafe/bar, as wee did. Some nice food stalls, located on the main ground floor, clothes and household products on the upper floor, and a fast food cafe",
          "I\u2019m sure this is a great spot for locals to get fresh bread and meat and do general grocery shopping but it\u2019s not worth a special visit.",
          "Having read several reviews I did not expect a huge market, but this is less than I thought. Maybe because it was on a Saturday, half of the stores were closed and the rest was not as expected. There is a number of \"tourists shops\" on the outer layer and probably the most",
          "It's worth visiting the Market Hall and there's certainly plenty to see inside, but for me it doesn't have the atmosphere (or the sheer scale) of somewhere like the Ladies' Market which is a largely outdoor affair and seemed much busier. Still, if the weather's chilly there are",
          "Nice place to find a large variety of food, fresh bread, nuts, meat products, milk products, fruits, veggies, drinks and various other consumer goods (pharmacy, clothing, luggage, jewelry, etc.). Ready to eat meals, fully cooked, available for take-away as well. A small Caf\u00e9",

          "The building itself is the highlight here. What's inside is nothing really exciting, although the the food inhad from one of the stalls was very good. Worth a quick look",
          "Visited here after reading some interesting reviews, but here are the key points: - the building is an impressive piece of architecture. - the nearby synagogue and mosque should be visited. - it is not like the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, it is a local market so adjust your",
          "My wife and I visited the Central Market Hall (Tsentralni Hali) when visiting Sofia during a 10-day holiday in Bulgaria. It is located a couple of blocks off the main highway through the city (Todor Alexandrov Blvd), immediately opposite the Sofia Synagogue. There are three",
          "A tourist trap, and the merchants are in some sort of competition with each other. The cafe on the first floor won't serve you if they see you bought pastry from one of the other shops, even if you just want to have coffee. Bizarre attitude, rude staff. Everything sold there is",
          "Indoor market with local products and a few eating places. We went there for trying famous banitsa (Bulgarian cheese pie), boza (a fermented wheat drink) and ayran (yogurt-based beverage) but ended up with a soar stomach- don\u2019t mix them all.",
          "Not really much to see in the Central Market ... it's a pretty average market that may once have been interesting, but now only the building holds any real interest ... the shops inside are entirely pedestrian. It does sit between the Banya Mosque and the synagogue, so you can",
          "Average market hall, and the term 'average' is generous. This place is nothing out of the ordinary, and it makes me wonder why it's even listed as a TA tourist attraction! Bakery goods looked as if they'd been sitting on the trays for years. Produce looked as if it was dying a",
          "It's very close to Sedrica metro station and Deity All-Holy Sophia Monument. You may satisfy your daily needs and gift shopping. Also there is small bar and cafe.",
          "During our visit it was quite, quiet, no a lot of punters, (we were told by a local, this is due to the huge malls popping up along the metro), however it was still fun to walk amongst the different vendors, we had lunch at one of the stand up tables. All in all a nice outing.",
          "We have visited many of these indoor markets in other European cities and this place is extremely average by comparison, the stall sellers lack any enthusiasm, the quality of produce is not of a high standard and the eating options were poor and few , we were not tempted to try",
          "This is an indoor market with many options to eat something or buy some souvenirs and local products. Not very exciting but worth a visit.",
          "You can find here the best from Sofia shopping experience - souvenirs, diary products and clothes. Prices are intermediate and it's located indoors and though open for a longer time than other markets. It is not a place where locals do their shopping but it may be close to it.",
          "As you enter you get the feeling of community, lots of stalls used by locals & a very pleasant atmosphere. We wandered & had a coffee the first time stopping to buy pretty Christmas decorations. We then went back as I really wanted to try the cheese toasts - so glad we did they",
          "the market is very little, but you can find here every kink of food to eat and buy there all so big super market, it was very nice to seat for coffee you can find here suitcases and chess' the toilet very dirty",
          "If you pass by, enter it. But if you want to purchase fresh bannitsa (traditional Bulgarian food in the b\u00f6rek family prepared of cheese between filo pastry and then baking it in an oven) - you have to step in and wait for one, just from the oven. You can also purchase very good",
          "I walked around. Maybe I wasn't there at such a great time of day which was after dark. I was dull i thought.",
          "The Central Sofia Market Hall is closely located to the mosque and the synagogue and next to the Metro Serdika II entrance. It has three floors with stalls offering food, clothes and more. It's worth a visit but it's more because of the style of the building. The products",
          "The place is very easy to find and the prices are very good. You can buy local products like cheese, meat and other products. I recommend the pastries with the Bulgarian cheese filling. you can have a bowl of soup for less then one euro and a slice of pizza for less. Dont miss",
          "A straightforward market which sells a variety of everything. The centrepiece at the rear on the ground floor is an open, roomy and airy bar called Tosca. Local large beer costs 2.2Lev- a bargain!",
          "Was expecting a bustling market, but it was actually pretty small and was not very busy when we visited. There were some interesting stalls, especially bakeries, and even a Taiwanese food stall. However, the choice was quite limited and there wasn't a vibrant atmosphere I was",
          "Found this place whilst viewing the mosque (directly opposite). Great place to visit with a mix of stalls and places to eat and drink. Impressive iron works that provide the structure to the building. Also check out the clock at the end of the hall. Definitely a place to go.",
          "It's really central, right opposite the Mosque in the midst of the tourist area, looking like an imposing government building but when you swing open the heavy doors you're inside a marketplace with Tosca Cafe on the ground floor. This cafe is really strategically placed, right",
          "We spent a bit of time here on a rainy Monday morning in Sofia, it's pretty lame as markets go and no big deal if you miss it.",
          "A good way to save an old building: renovate and give it a new purpose. The market is mainly used by locals. I guess there are just not enough tourists yet to sustain it in another way. It means prices are generally average. Perhaps better in winter. I found it rather hot",
          "Probably a good place for locals to buy groceries...but not a tourist spot. It was very disappointing as we thought it would be bigger and have more local goods and wares. Overall, it was a big bust...no reason to really visit unless you're buying meat and produce. The entire",
          "Central Market Hall (Halite) is a compact, covered market on Maria Luisa blvd., vis-a-vis the big Mosque. It's hard to imagine that a building with such an elegant facade (elements of fine architecture with an arch above the main entrance and a small clock) houses a.. ..market.",

          "We've been to markets ALL OVER the world.......Central Market Hall was underwhelming. You can certainly find something to snack on......or have a coffee....or purchase souvenirs.......but that's not us. it wasn't out of our way, because we WERE going to the Mosque and the",

          "Lovely market. Full of souvenir shops and several food markets. It is a must visit in Sofia! You can also find Roses of Boulgaria in there! Perfect market",
          "The Central Market Hall is a very close to the Banya Bashi Mosque or the Sofia Synagogue. it's a nice place to stop by for a taste of Bulgarian culinary culture or to buy handicrafts. It's small and interesting. One of the popular shops is Bakers. They have good pastries,",
          "I knew the outcome before visiting and before planning my trip to Bulgaria so that I weren't disappointed too much ! Got to agree with some other reviews here or at least bits of it, yes food and other items seems bit limited, what I did buy to eat from bakery was tasty that I",
          "A relatively small hall offering limited choices of food, drink, and general items. The most interesting aspect is the building itself, rather than the contents!",

          "Walked through the market on my way to the synagogue. The outside of the building looks more interesting than the interior. Your average mini mall.",
          "On the outside this hall is a rather ornate Neo-Renaissance building with Baroque and Byzantine features. Look out for the Sofia coat-of-arms over the main entrance. Also note the clock tower. This structure was first opened in 1911. On the ground floor there are some excellent",
          "It's a nice place to go, with relatively low food prices, but to me, it had nothing special. Went there on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't crowded.",
          "I visited every day, the quality of the cakes were something else! It's quiet, clean and locals shop there. Not as big as the market in Budapest but enough craft stalls for the hardened shopper to enjoy looking at.",
          "lots of different shops, food, cheese, sausages, arts and craft, fresh produce and much more, also buffet style eatery, coffee places, it\u00b4s a good place if it\u00b4s cold outside and you want to warm up. Great bakeries, too. only locals there during my visit, which was perfect.",
          "If you decide that Sofia Hali is similar to other markets in the world where you can enjoy the taste of fresh food for your breakfast or lunch BEWARE! It is prohibited! Our small group was surrounded by a security team and forced out of market with the words: \"No eating! Just",
          "This is exactly what lots of revamped markets in the U.K. try, but fail, to be. Lots of locals seem to shop, eat & congregate here. The coffee shop in the centre does excellent sandwiches & coffee at bargain prices compared to local coffee shops. Rather than the empty stalls",
          "Most of the stores were closed. A lot of strange people around the entrances watch on you.. If you pass by, just have a look.",
          "We enjoy coming here for a coffee and toasty! It's fascinating sitting and just watching what's going on. We like the architecture and also just mooching around. If you're short of time on your visit to Sofia don't bother but if you have time and it's freezing outside go and",
          "Nice centrally located market place, but lacking big assortment of goods. You can find fresh foods and some souvenirs for tourists. Fast food available on 2nd floor. Also prices are a bit higher than usual.",
          "The market is very clean and organised. I love seeing the different foods that people buy! You can also buy leather goods (belts, wallets, bags and gloves). There is a coffee shop too, and you can buy freshly squeezed juices. There are also a few curio shops, that were very",
          "Is just a market with no price or variety differences than the shops in the rest of the city. Only If you have enough time go there",
          "Build beginning 20th century. Unique architecture (cast iron, steel, glass...). Two levels: ground floor with all kinds of shops: vegetables, fruit, meat..., very colourful. First level: cosmetics, clothing..., (scent of roses...). Market place for locals.",
          "I came for the architecture of the building, I must admit. I liked it more than the souveniers or food sold there. Anyway, it's worth a stroll.",

          "A Market Hall for the locals. It does not have a big number of shops . It's very clean,cleaner than I expected. There are:Bakery,Alcohol shop,sweets shop,jewellery shop,flower shop,butcher shop and others. You can found it right before the synagogue on the principal Street Maria",

          "It is kind of touristic now, but still it is perfect place to buy traditional food and beverages. :)",
          "There are so many shops here on two levels. You were spoiled for choice in various fast foods, sandwiches, and clothing. This is where I bought my Bulgarian souvenirs, and I did not see them cheaper anywhere else. (Four times the price at the Airport)",
          "Visited market on a warn Novemer's day. Quite a few stalls open but with very few customers. There are a few places to eat and you can also have a beer in the middle of the market.",
          "A great place! A market hall with fantastic shops and great places to eat. Also a selection of fine leather goods and the famous rose scents!",
          "If you are staying is Sofia and need to get some groceries and maybe grab a coffee on the way, that's not a bad spot. There are a few merchants that are quite great for meats, breads, pastries, cheeses etc. no real fruit or veggie. There are also little stands with clothing,",
          "Situated close to the main tourist area in Sofia the market is open until 9pm and mainly sells fresh food. Meat, cheese, fruit and vegetables etc. Couple of coffee shops to and all housed in an old building. Worth a look if your on the area.",
          "It sure looks good from the outside. Inside it is regular marketplace where they sell different kinds of meat, cheese and wines etc. not anything special about all, though the central coffee place was nice to sit down after some city walking.",
          "Not a flea market , not really a market , cross between little shop/market stores . Bar in the middle , and bank upstairs if that gives you more of an idea what I mean . If it's cold or raining you could spend some time in there , but wouldn't go out of your way .",
          "The architecture - outside and inside - is lovely and the interior reminded me of the Central Market in Budapest. I visited just before 6pm and it was busy with locals on their way home from work. A lot of the upstairs space is taken up with a pharmacy and this drew most of",
          "I love market halls like this a bit more than people usually do, so you may be a bit more disappointed than I was. They could have developed this more, for sure, but I love the food stands and the small shops with ceramics that can be found here. I recommend a visit here,",
          "If you haven't enough time, you can ignore this market. It is clean and renovated, but has no atmosphere of a traditional food market.",
          "Great to preserve the Victorian market hall. Good art nouveau exterior. Inside disappoints. Few traditional food stall. But there are lots of little shops. Can't complain.",
          "The large hall holds few food, cheese, meat and wine stores and some memorabilia stands for tourists. When we visited the place was mostly empty of people except for the cheap pharm store on the top floor. If you look for some quick and cheap bite, go ahead and visit, otherwise,",
          "It is a great place to go if you want to buy Bulgarian products. However it smells dead fish. It's located between the mosque and the synagogue.",
          "Nice food court, where you can buy local cheese and salami, fish&sea products, different breads and pastries and freshly made fruit juices. Having tested many banitzars (a local pastry with white cheese filling) I can say this one is the best in all Bulgaria! The sweet apple",
          "They have stalls selling fresh cheese and cold cuts, and a few souvenir stores, it's a small complex of 2 floors, and the second floors consists of one small mart and the stores besides it won't open. Come only if you have spare time.",
          "Interesting place with nice architecture. Located just north of Vitosha street, and near the Synagogue. Mosque being just across the street from it. Nice place to see if you're in the area.",
          "This is a lovely small market, located in a lovely building, with numerous stalls selling every kind of food you can think about. Don't miss the Bulgarian cheese pastries. They are delicious and cheap.",

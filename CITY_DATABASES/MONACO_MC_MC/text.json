        "wiki": "The Oceanographic Museum (Mus\u00e9e oc\u00e9anographique) is a museum of marine sciences in Monaco-Ville, Monaco.\nIt is home to the Mediterranean Science Commission. This building is part of the Oceanographic Institute, which is committed to sharing its knowledge of the oceans.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Oceanographic Museum was inaugurated in 1910 by Monaco's modernist reformer, Prince Albert I.Jacques-Yves Cousteau was director from 1957 to 1988. The Museum celebrated its centenary in March 2010, after extensive renovations.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe museum is home to exhibitions and collections of various species of sea fauna (starfish, seahorses, turtles, jellyfish, crabs, lobsters, rays, sharks, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, eels, cuttlefish etc.). The museum's holdings also include a great variety of sea related objects, including model ships, sea animal skeletons, tools, weapons etc., as well as a collection of material culture and ritual objects made from, or integrating materials such as pearls, molluscs and nacre.At the first floor, A Sailor\u2019s Career showcases the work of Prince Albert I. It includes the laboratory from L\u2019Hirondelle, the first of Prince Albert's research yachts. Observations made there led to an understanding of the  phenomenon of anaphylaxis, for which Dr Charles Richet received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1913.An aquarium in the basement of the museum presents a wide array of flora and fauna. Four thousand species of fish and over 200 families of invertebrates can be seen. The aquarium also features a presentation of Mediterranean and tropical marine ecosystems.Numerous artists display their artworks in the museum, such as Damien Hirst and Philippe Pasqua.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThis monumental example of highly charged Baroque Revival architecture has an impressive fa\u00e7ade above the sea, towering over the sheer cliff face to a height of 279 feet (85.04 m). It took eleven years to build, using 100,000 tons of stone from La Turbie. During construction, the names of twenty well-known oceanographic research vessels personally selected by Prince Albert I were inscribed into the frieze of the museum's fa\u00e7ade.\n\n\n=== Oceanographic research vessels inscribed on fa\u00e7ade ===\n\n\n== Caulerpa taxifolia ==\nIn 1989, French marine biologist Alexandre Meinesz discovered a patch of a giant, tropical seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia directly under the walls of the museum. Several documentaries point to this patch as the origin of one of the largest seaweed contaminations of the Mediterranean Sea in recent history. The role of the museum and its director, Fran\u00e7ois Doumenge when the discovery was made public is still heavily debated.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in French) (in English)\nGuide to visiting the Museum",

          "Pretty nice. Cost 16 euro per adult. Admission for Children under 4 is free. Pretty nice. Does not compare of course to Monterey Bay aquarium or other big names out there.

          "People need to stop complaining about the museum being busy... Just go at the right time (end of the afternoon or look at google statistics) and you'll see one of the most beautiful museums in the world.",

          "Really not worth the 14\u20ac!\nA drama to find and that with 2 kids!\n\nNon-monaco people cant access the road leading to the \u201cmuseum\u201d.\nYou need to park your car in the local over crowded under ground parking lots.\n\nAfter finding the way out in \u2026",
          "Amazing building. The aquariums except one were not big and the variety was not enough for us to give it a 5 star review. For sure though the Best thing We visited in monaco",
          "Oceanography Museums may be thought as places for just children but this joyful place may intrigue grown ups as well. With a wonderful underwater life and great displays, keep at least 3 hours to visit this place.",
          "It is nice! The building is cool! A little bit crowded. You can see plenty of species and also the views from the top are great. The museum shows you great animals and skeletons that are amazing in the real size! Its a place to visit with kids. For adults its ok, but not indispensable.",
          "Fantastic museum, very diverse collection and the presentation is great. Don't miss out on the light show and also visit the roof for some panoramic views. If you visit Monaco don't miss out on this museum.",

          "Small museum but really informative about the marine and ocean.. Children has a lot of fun",
          "It's interesting. Don't skimp out on checking out the museum. You can get a joint ticket (prince palace + museum) which is a bargain, especially for students. I am a bit worried about octopi and big fish being in small aquariums though..",
          "Was not the nicest aquarium I\u2019ve been to by far. Is very difficult to get to it from the train station. Bathrooms are very dirty. Air conditioning wasn\u2019t good enough to keep it cool. Barely any seating to take a rest. Would not recommend this place at all!",
          "Well worth a visit if you can fit it in your schedule. So much to see and all exhibits and aquariums in immaculate tanks. Low admission cost is a benefit for families. A brilliant ' plan B' on rainy days !",

          "The museum part is amazing and you can actually see that there's a lot of work put into it. The building is absolutely stunning and very well preserved. The only part I didn't like was the aquarium. I understand that the idea is to educate, \u2026",
          "Interesting museum, quite crowded... Lovely rooftop terrace for spectacular views over Monaco. Buy a combined ticket with Palace, best value for money",
          "Bit sad they don\u2019t have the giant shark on the rooftop anymore. Nice museum though. Allow a few hours. We bought a combo ticket from gardin exotique.",

          "Its a nice place to visit with the kids. Was a nice experience and for the fee its worth it",
          "A must-see. Whole family enjoyed it. Beautiful museum filled with aquatic life. So much to take in... We were there in July so it was really packed but we loved it nonetheless. We bought our tickets at the wicket but you may buy them online too. Excellent family destination.",
          "Great. Very very busy when we went and they could turn up the air conditioning. Good value for money all in all.",
          "It's very nice building and architecture. The aquarium is cute but very crowded. The rest, feels more like an interactive exposition than a museum. Quite disappointed.\n\nThey also have all their curtains closed on all floors. Don't go on a sunny day.\n\nPrice is about 10\u20ac for students.",
          "A bit expensive for what it is, but interesting. Many people inside due to the rain, and it felt very humid and hot inside. Was a bit claustrophobic at one stage, and some people find it impossible to follow directions.\nOn the 1st floor \u2026",

          "Super experience! On the lower level, there is an aquarium, on the upper level, there is a museum. Both are amazing and interesting. Not only for adults but also for children: many little \u201cgames\u201d make it easy and understandable for both, \u2026",

          "Beutiful museum, with many spices to see. Very well organized.\nBreathtaking views from the museum garden.",
          "Incredible museum and aquarium.  So many different species and information on each one. The entire museum was clean, easy to get through and informative. On the higher floors, it's more of a museum than an aquarium and you learn so much on Albert I and his travels. It's definitely worth seeing.",
          "As aquariums go, this is one of the better ones we have seen. It has marine life from all over the world, while also covering the entire range of the Mediterranean. All displays were accompanied by multilingual interactive touchscreen \u2026",
          "A must if you are visiting Monaco. Beautiful building, lovely (if small) tanks. And the sea turtle rescue program!!!",
          "It's a wonderful place to take the kids with a small playground on the rooftop and views to die for! I just wish they would have more areas to engage small kids.",

          "Old school. It is interesting but not a must see. Our visit was enjoyable since we went there very early before the large crowds arrived. At the end of our visit (one hour), the exhibition halls filled up quickly. There is a restaurant and \u2026",

          "Very, very interesting. Allow hours to really enjoy. If you have clostophia, you may have a hard time. Because of displays, it is not very bright inside and it is downstairs mostly. Don't miss a thing. It is also outside at the end. Afterwards, beautiful view from top outside",
          "The Oceanographic Museum is wonderful. It has an excellent collection of fish, in all sorts of different aquariums and naturally decorated. There is also an other section of the museum. It is for the ocean explorers and their history. It is beautifully done and a must see.",
          "This was an absolute highlight on our day trip to Monaco. The most beautiful building and a great aquarium, as well as great rehabilitation centre. I would really recommend this and it\u2019s a short walk from the Palace with great views.",
          "Monaco is a beautiful city. It is built on pure stones. Amazing view from the top of the hills. Visit the Mus\u00e9e oc\u00e9anique is one my highlight. Although this beautiful city is built around wealths, do not have any expectations when going to public toilets (Dirty /old and no",
          "This museum is just a short way from the Prince's palace , as a passable restaurant on the roof and we spent a very enjoyable 2 hours there and did not really tour the upper floor . I have to say the aquarium is well designed and laid out BUT i was personally a little disturbed",
          "Visiting aquariums is one of my passions. I was surprised and pleased to visit this one -- it far exceeded my expectations. And the most amazing feature thereof is that it's almost 150 years old!",
          "very beautiful location, many species, the building is beautiful, the price is correct, it is absolutely necessary",
          "This small museum has a wonderful collection of interesting sea life. Children on the day we were there were running from one display to the next, excited by the amazing colors of the fish and various sea creatures. We spent a very pleasant hour there....and saw many creatures",
          "What a wonderful aquarium! Plan to spend several hours including lunch at the rooftop cafe. Delicious! Also on the upper terrace are panoramic views, lovely breezes, a children\u2019s play area and an enclosure with plenty of tortoises. We hated to leave.",
          "This aquarium may not be as large or flashy as some, but it has a remarkably large selection of fish and other local ocean life with very clear identification and explanations. The two resident sea turtles are a bonus! Interesting even if you just like to look at the pretty",
          "During a daytrip to Monaco, we visited this museum. It's a must, don't miss it! The adult ticket is 16 eur, its nothing! Absolutely worth the price. I always found myself watching the animals with an open mouth... its incredible! So interesting, so beautiful. My favourite part",
          "An aquarium with a difference. Several species I have never seen before, such as a nautical shell with inhabitant, and a cuttlefish. Also seahorses and an octopus. There are the fish one usually sees, and interesting tanks of jellyfish etc.Finishing with a couple of turtles",
          "The tanks seem tiny. The sharks seemed crowded and the octopus was scaling the walls of its tiny enclosure trying to escape or hide but never quite managing to get there. There was nowhere for them to retreat to if they felt overwhelmed, just a small triangle to live in. There",
          "Although one of the \"old-style\" aquariums (mostly small tanks displaying creatures found in the Mediterranean), it has a great deal of good displays and information. Built atop and going down the side of a cliff (inside), there's one very large aquarium that's a few stories",
          "Fabulous place to visit. Fascinating variety of sea life. Only downside is the difficulty of driving to the right place to park.",
          "The view from the opposing side of the museum is just terrific. The backdrop is unobtrusive and if you continue on your way down, you'll find a nice little swimming hole!",
          "I must say whenever i have friends visiting me, the museum is on my visit list. This time, however, i was truly shocked by the new so called attraction of turtles. It is an outside location next to the museum, nicely landscaped at the first look. But the water bassin with one",

          "I think this attraction is one of \"must to see\" in Monako. It has 3 or 4 floors. There are the biggest turtle we\u00b4ve ever seen. You can see thousands of type of fishes either sea water or fresh water. Price is accordingly you could see. We bought ticket in combination with",
          "This Monaco Oceanographic Museum has a long tradition (from 1910) but is perhaps the most known as a place where a naval legend Jacques-Yves Cousteau (a naval explorer, filmmaker, innovator, photographer, author and researcher) was director from 1957 to 1988. Therefore there is",
          "Good museum in a fantastic building and a convenient location near the princes palace and 15 mins walk from the port. Lots of different sea-life creatures, from fish to jelly fish, stingrays to turtles and a large room with pre-historic skeletons. Was nice to have a walk round",
          "This Museum was there with Cousteau and the Grimaldi decades before it was fashionable for cities to have a Oceanographic. Recently refurbished with great care it is a must do on the Cote d Azur and Monaco",

          "The building is amazing. The museum has a lot of nice objects and I loved the fact that they have a whole section about preserving the Ocean but (and this is a big but) where are the recycling bins? Let alone recycling, they should not be selling any single-use plastics in and",
          "A good experience and lots of different fish to see in the aquarium. We did find it very busy and therefore difficult to see some of the exhibits. The turtle exhibit outside was brilliant with the backdrop of views from the sea. The museum was also good.",
          "Great place to visit. So well organized and well kept too. Recommend to get your online pass or tickets.",
          "We absolutely loved this museum, the fish were amazing and the turtles, we would highly recommend this visit",
          "The museum was founded by the best and kept all their experience, passing from old to young. many activities for the kids, for both, brain and body. One can see highly skilled professionals taking care of the animals. Staff very friendly and always happy to share their knowledge",
          "My husband traveled in with a cruise ship and decided to check out the museum. We walked from the port to the museum, which was a gorgeous walk! The museum's ticket was of normal price and you were able to walk up to machine or wait in line. We walked up to the machine because",
          "This aquarium is situated in a beautiful location the walk there from the bus stop along the coast is lovely. The building itself is fabulous.. tickets were around 35e for 2 people and for the few hours I think it is worth it. More space is definitely needed for the amount of",
          "The aquarium is fun to visit with good and interesting descriptions. They do not have huge fish tanks but there are some beatiful and unusual species. There was not too much crowd allowing for comfortable visit - I recommend to buy joint ticket to palace and aquarium earlier. In",
          "This is the most stunning aquarium I have ever seen, with some fantastic displays. However, the space given to a lot of the sea life is insufficient with stress behaviours evident in a number of tanks. Visit but be aware, this is effectively a zoo, so not the best way of seeing",
          "Amazing place! We were invited and had a private tour...wonderful experience! It is highly recommend to stop here when touring the area!",
          "A really good day full of fascinating things to see. It cost \u20ac16 each and it was well worth the money. They have tanks full of wonderful sea life including sharks and a wide variety of fish. Each tank has interactive information in French, Italian and English. The sea turtles",
          "The museum itself was wonderful and so well done but I was so upset to see x2 massive sea turtles in such a small enclosure - the tank should be atleast x5 times the size... please do something about this hence the low rating :(",

          "The museum is a living organism. It has hundreds of marine animals in all kind of sizes of aquariums. It is an excellent place for kids to visit; they will learn a lot and excite their imagination. I ennjoyed my visit, and I wish I spend more time, but we were on a time table. I",
          "Cool aquarium and I guess we were lucky in early July 2019 when we went as it was not that crowded. It's not big like the Genova aquarium (180 KM further east in Italy) but it's cool. Note that it is on south-east side of the mountain (on top of mountain) south of the port",
          "We enjoyed our visit here! The turtle exhibit was very cool, and they had several other tanks with diverse species. The only reason it did not earn a 5-star from me was that I expected to see more live fish and creatures. The aquarium part was only half of the museum and the",

          "We went here on a friday around 2 o\u2019clock, it was busy but not packed so we could still see all the fish in the aquaria. The enclosures fit the theme and it was all high quality technology, the fish looked healthy. The sea turtle enclosure outside was amazing overlooking the",

          "Everytime we\u2018re here we have to visit this place, our daughter and myself are amazed by all the different species they hold. Even though the place is kind of small and you can browse quickly through it it\u2019s worth a visit. And enjoy the view of this stunning building litterally",
          "We have been to a lot of aquariums and my husband really didnt want to do another one. He really enjoyed it, was so glad he went. It's amazing , well worth your time. Highly recommend it.",

          "Perched on a cliff by the palace gardens, this museum has plenty to see. Many aquarium displays with tons of fish and other marine creatures, a fossil display, a deep sea dive simulator, displays on marine exploration and a turtle rescue center. All that and a restaurant and",

          "Visited the aquarium of the museum between 10 and noon. The place was not packed but there was quite a lot of people and children. No problem with getting good views of all the aquarium tanks, though! The place gives off a vibe of being quite small and not very extraordinary",
          "For 30 years, Jack Eve Cousteau's was the director of the museum. The number one place to visit in Monaco!",
          "Although the entire aquarium settings are of modest size, the electronic screens in multiple languages give new insight to the unique creatures in the tanks. The hatching fish were fascinating. The jellyfish were beautifully displayed. Saw some sea life that we\u2019d never seen",
          "You need to have at least 2 hrs to nicely enjoy the beauty that the museum has to offer. The fish we've seen here were unique, the history behind this museum is inspiring too. The ticket costs 14 per adult. We confirm this is worth it. Perfectly maintained museum, great stuff,",
          "A great place, with the aquarium a great place to start off. There is a large variety of fish, jellyfish, sea turtles etc to keep everyone entertained! Then it\u2019s upstairs for the rest of the museum. Well worth spending 2-3 hours here, and \u20ac10 for a student isn\u2019t bad!",

          "The museum isn't too large so it won't take too much of your time. The aquariums are awesome and the biggest highlight of the place. As a tip, also check out the building from the Sea side as well. It is fascinating how they have built it on the top of the Sea.",
          "This adorable building meets you exactly after packing's exit by escalator. In front of museum you can see some interesting statues, like golden skull, and the most famous one is yellow submarine from immortal hit of \"The Beatles\". Visiting for sure recommended for families with",

          "Awesome aquarium! Though the animal selection does not rival Monterey or Chicago, it is definitely world-class, and the museum was fantastic--skeletal display of large ocean-dwelling mammals was really cool (and very appealing for my 5-year old). Highly recommended!",
          "14 Euros for an amazing Museum. Great Value. The history of this place is incredible and what the Leaders of Monaco have tried to do for decades to save the plant and ocean is inspirational and impressive. Jacques Cousteau was Director of this Museum for 30 years. Really nice",

          "We were at the aquarium in mid April. The crowds were minimal. Admission for two was 26 Euros. The Monaco bus (No1&2) pass to get there is obtainable either on board from the driver for 2euros or at the ticket machine for 1.5 euros. The aquarium initially accessed by a steel set",
          "If you have already visited Deep Sea World in the UK, you probably won't be blown away by the tanks at this museum, although the jelly fish were strangely hypnotic to watch, and there's a nice big tank with colourful tropical fish. I visited off season on a sunny day, but even",
          "Came here with a 10 year old and 12 year old and they were suitably entertained. Lots of fish to see in the basement but after that it\u2019s more historical. Spent majority of our time in the basement and the top floor is basically a restaurant with a small turtle pen. Worth while",
          "I did not know the museum existed until I went there with some freinds. Athough it i clearly old that just adds to the charm of the experience. We hired a guide and he was so knowledgeable and spoke very good English. It was fascinating to learn about how one of the early",

          "Amazing variety of exotic living creatures. Beautiful building. Beautiful walk to the building. Wonderful views of Monaco and beyond from the building. Rooftop restaurant and cafe. 100% recommend anyone to visit this museum.",
          "It\u2019s an aquarium, mostly tropical displays. There was however a smaller Mediterranean display. As an aquarium, it\u2019s average to poor, nothing like the Baltimore aquarium...if you were looking for oceanography like I was, this was definitely not oceanographic!",
          "Very good lighshow on the hour, played over the whale skeletons, spooky. Think it was 14euro to get in. Worth it though.",
          "Best aquarium I've been to. Took alot of cool pictures and enjoyed myself for a few hours. Visit if you are in the neighborhood.",
          "spent a rainy afternoon in the museum - it was amazing and enthralling - did not think I would enjoy something like this but really enjoyed it as did my friends and teenage boy who was with us",
          "Spent an hour here. Great exhibition of tropical fish. Worth a visit but an hour is enough. Very clean and tidy",
          "We were very much looking forward to our visit to the oceanography museum that may have inspired so many aquariums and oceanographers. However, we have visited the many others - such as Monterey and the Aquarium of the Pacific - so for us, Monaco's Oceanography Museum wasn't",

          "The museum itself is nicely structured and gives insides about many different topics: sea animals / history of boating etc. Even though the sea world has some spectacular fish, their aquariums are super small and some have almost no space to move, which is quite sad...",
          "We took the bus number 2 from SNCF station to Monaco Ville, the musuem is very close. The musuem has 2 floors of aquarium, 1 floor of ocean collectibles and dinasour remains and top floor for Monaco city view. Overall happy with the experience but the tickets are on the costly",
          "My daughter wanted to visit this site so we entered . It was much better than I would have imagined. We all enjoyed the magnitude of sea life on display here .",
          "I absolutely cannot fault this place. We were in a day trip from Nice and decided to get the combined ticket with the car museum, which reduced the price. It was a bit of a walk from the train station with small children, but the views and sights on the way made it ok. The",
          "We were hiking around Monte Carlo, and decided to take the \u201cboat taxi\u201d from the Marina to the Oceanographic Museum. One can get there via bus, or boat taxi, but if you use the boat taxi it is a a bit of steep walk up to the Museum. The displays are spread out over four",
          "I would have given 3.5 out of 5 if possible as the exhibits did not disappoint and feeding time with sharks is always bound to excite. There is an expansion under way and that might clinch the extra 1/2 point. The venue calls itself a museum and true there are numerous exhibits",
          "As a lovers of the oceans, this destination was at the top of our Monaco list and it was spectacular! From the location right on the Med, to the gorgeous building and the quality of the marine exhibits, the Oceanographic Museum inspires and teaches the need for mankind to be",
          "This is a magnificent museum and education for everyone that loves the ocean and cares for the future or our oceans and planets. The educational nature of this museum is breath taking in its modernity and simplicity. This is a humbling and thought provoking museum, it is well",
          "Has a number of levels. The aquarium is in the lower levels. Well set out and good information. Other floors have displays of sea life more like the natural history museum in London. Top floor had a restaurant which is not cheep (what is in 'Monaco!) but has killer view.",
          "I echo other reviews when I say we visited on a particularly hot day! This probably made the walk seem longer and more hilly! We visited in the afternoon and didn't have to queue for tickets. Tickets are slightly pricey in my opinion. The aquarium was great, with lots of info",
          "The is a very cool place to visit as the displays and different and very informative Ask for the multi ticket as you can get to see other sites at a discount.. Great free Wifi also",
          "This is defiantly worth a visit - this aquarium/museum is huge and there is lots to see and do here. There are a wide range of exotic fish here. I would recommend buying your tickets before as it does get busy. Just outside they have a tour train that cost \u20ac10 each for a",
          "Good muesum and great presentation of all fishes. Probably the best I have seen till date. Just brilliant! Must go. You will not be disappointed. We had doubts when we were going in because we had seen many but this was far far better. Adults was 16 and kids a bit less. Just",
          "It is a fairly lengthy walk up to the museums but it is well signed, we went on August so the walk was hot. The museum building is beautiful and the old fashioned layout of the exhibits is quaint, though not as engaging as some other museums, there was a lot to read to get the",

          "If you\u2019ve visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium, you\u2019ve ruined any other ocean museum experience. This was a decent attempt but nothing like Monterey Bay. It is something to do if you are sightseeing and have already lost all you spending money at the casino.",
          "It is a lovely place, with occasional exhibitions and collections. The view from the top of the building is Amazing! Suggested to buy combined ticket with the Prince`s Palace Ticket, it comes to better value (go to the ticket office which is front of the Royal Palace). Cons.:",
          "Collection was quite good. Lots of sharks, different fishes. Some skeletons were there. You can find lots of Nemo there, one dory also.",
          "All you can see from underseas! So much to learn! Years and years of studies and research all kept in this amazing building on the center of the Great Principate of Monaco, France!",
          "My highest recommendation. I have never seen such beautiful sea creatures before. Amazing aquariums with magic atmosphere. It worth to buy one shared ticket for Museum and for palace. It is cheaper together and you will like both places.",
          "Must see if you not on a short rush around Monaco seeing everything in a few hours. Provides a good side attraction to escape the heat. We arrived here via the hop-on-hop off bus. The actual displays are not any different to any other good aquarium but great for kids.",
          "We went on a Saturday around 1430 and it was busy but not overly. There are so many different fish to see and lots of information about them. Great for all ages and definitely value for money. Upstairs is a gathering of typical collectibles from over the years but not my",
          "One of the coolest place to take your kid to. Madly interesting for children and parents both, a lot of activity for kids",
          "This museum should be in in ur must visit list in Monaco, because it is definitely worth it for a visit, they introduce every kind of sea animals in three languages( English French and Italian) It is also a very good place to escape the strong sunshine in August. The museum is",
          "My visit took place around 1pm on 2018/08/14. There were way too many people in the aquarium area. We could barely move. The A/C couldn't keep up, it was too hot and too loud. I have never seen such a badly managed museum in my entire life. I notified the staff there were too",
          "This bustling aquarium was a favourite stop of ours. Beautiful tanks with a fantastic array of colourful fish. The museum is also a fascinating portion of the trip, we really liked the grand building and all of its specimens and models. We arrived on foot in the sunshine and",
          "Wonderful aquarium with digital displays will captivate you, I hope. There are species I have not seen anywhere. The upper floors are great too, telling the story of Prince Albert and his travels and discoveries.",
          "Go for the view of the sea and city from the rooftop, if nothing else. The building is massive but was not actually that much to see and the aquarium part was so crowded with families. I did a quick walk through but expected there to be more exhibits. Liked the gift shop at the",
          "Visited in the summer of 2017. It is a nice museum but i did expect it to be bigger and have more animals there.",
          "Rather crowded and small, but worthwhile to see. It\u2019s a one floor oceanic exhibition of some great species, and educational in terms of selection. They had advertised a big pond underneath the sea with sea turtles, sharks etc but found out it\u2019s the VR Cinema offering this",
          "Definitely worth a visit as there is such a lot to see. Downstairs are the aquariums with all types of fish including a massive tank with sharks and turtles. There is also a touch tank for smaller children. It\u2019s a great venue and the building itself is beautiful and hangs of the",
          "The building itself is a sight, perched on a cliff overlooking the sea. The aquarium is fantastic, full of every species of shark & fish you could think of. The star of the show for my kids were the Piranha`s but the layout is fantastic for kids with plenty of interactive things",
          "A must see if your in Monaco. Was very busy in the afternoon at 15:00. Reasonable price for what it has to offer.",
          "Well, I didn\u2019t know what to expect when visiting this place but.... the Oceanography Museum was out of this world! The aquarium was much better than the London one. Loads of information in multiple languages. Inviting fish tanks and very good groupings of species. Some very",
          "We came here since it\u2019s the location the famous Jacques Cousteau worked. It\u2019s been up dated, however it\u2019s no different from any other acquarium in the region.",
          "Worth the trip if you are there for the day. I recommend approaching via the walkway up from the harbor - some beautiful photo ops on the way up. We purchased the combo tix with the palace tour - worth it. Aquarium home to lots of Jacques Cousteau items - as someone who",

          "We visited the museum during our stay in Monaco because it was suggested by many people. While visiting I was a bit disappointed because it is not really different to any Ocean museum. Visit a \"Sea Life\" and you basically see the same. With 16 \u20ac entrance it is pretty expensive",
          "I enjoyed the visit to this aquarium as much as My 7 year old and 10 year old loved it. There is much to learn, amazing exhibits and plenty of displays to spend 3 or more hours discovering. Don\u2019t be in a hurry as each display has an interactive explanation with a lot of",

          "I wasn't expecting much at the museum and just needed a place to kill time before the evening, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The aquarium itself is nice, but definitely spend some time on the oceanographic artifacts side of the museum. Also do not miss out on the views",
          "Expected a little more in terms of aquarium however the views from the rooftop terrace made up for anything lacking inside. Interesting museum with some great artifacts though wouldn't specifically travel here just for this, although there is a lot too see around the area to",
          "The building is lavish, with impressive large rooms and lots of space. There is a small aquarium in the basement (the kids seemed to enjoy it), but to me the main attraction are the collections of oceanographic artefacts, from the days where nobody really knew, there was no",
          "Visited in July with family, one the 2 best places to visit in Monaco. The aquarium part is excellent, very modern, fishes presented in nice ways: we liked the little nemo fishes a lot, the medusa, and everyone loves the sharks swimming in a huge aquarium. The museum part is old",
          "There is a lot to see in this museum, it is very interactive and I believe it may be interesting for children and also adults. It is not only about the history of oceanography but you can also visit here an aquarium.",
          "We visited the south of France in July with 4 children. This was by far the highlight of our trip. We easily spent 2-3 hours going through the aquarium and the really near exhibits in the museum. We bought the combined museum and palace tickets but the kids would have been",
          "Brilliant museum, me & my friends loved it & love the plans they have for extension at the front. Very informative & cheap to enter, by Monaco\u2019s standards !",
          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is well worth visiting if you are at all interested in oceanography. While the aquarium tanks are a big part of the attraction, this is not simply an aquarium destination when compared to places like Ripley's Aquariums. Yes, there are shark",
          "Spent 1-2 hours with my 11 year old son here but soon got annoyed by the crowds. Go in the (early) morning, it\u2019s bound to be less busy. Obviously, it\u2019s dark down there and has poor ventilation so I left with quite the headache. Some very interesting species on display but",
          "This is not an aquarium, it\u2019s an oceanographic museum, so try to keep up. The reason it\u2019s not an aquarium is because the exhibits of sea life in its various habitats are so limited you\u2019d do better at SeaWorld. A huge amount of exhibition space is devoted to whales in what normal",
          "Visited with young children 10 & 7 on a busy July afternoon. Excellent aquarium, good multilingual information boards for each section, good variety of displays. Restaurant & snack bar on top floor with tortoise display & playground. Worth a visit .",

          "We went since theres not much else to do in Monte Carlo. Its a small aquarium but it has lots of different species in pretty small tanks. Its crowded and we had to queu in front of the aquariums to see whats in it. If you feel restless or has children along its a good place to",
          "Very nice, lots of wildlife. Little overcrowded by the chinese people( ooooch), but very educational fot the children. You can see how Cousteau did it in the early days, the old museum shows sculptures from around 1900 and still a food condition. However the children like the",
          "A bit expensive (16-18 euros for a person, as I recall, less for children less than 18 years old), but I can understand the price. The building itself is beautiful, has amazing views and interior, the collection is fascinating, I especially enjoyed the one on the top floor jus",
          "Looking inside out or outside in, the design and drama and views of the Oceanographic Museum wholly reflects the importance of the leadership Monaco gives on the fundamental importance of protecting our Oceans and their inhabitants. A must see on any visit to the Cote D'Azur.",
          "This Museum was the Home of famed undersea explorer Jacque Cousteau. However his research lives on. Ive been to many Aquariums around the world, but this one is by far, one of the best, there are long waiting lines outside, so it is best to buy a ticket online or go with a tour",
          "The shark pool has left the greatest impression, where you can feed live sharks. there was something wow here.",
          "This was a great stop during our visit to Monaco. The building is an architectural gem. The acquarium tanks on the lower floor are filled with a variety of sea life. The baby spotted jellyfish from Australia and the nautilus were my favorite. There are some excellent exhibits on",
          "The building is beautiful and the aquarium totally exceeded my expectations. The main tank is very large and contains a huge shark, turtle and countless other fish/species. All tanjs were beautiful and spotless, appears to be super well kept. Highly recommend it",
          "Walk in and see all those old specimens collected in the days of the gentleman explorer. The museum maintains that wonderful old flavor of museums that displayed specimens preserved in formaldehyde, unique and wonderful items collected from all corners of the world. One room",
          "Take a look on what is going beneath the waves. From seahorses to sharks. There is also alot of history presented. Great for the whole family.",
          "I was a little skeptical about visiting the museum but that skepticism quickly vanished when I saw the gigantic tank with live sharks and other sea creatures. The best viewing of this engineering wonder is from below where you can look up 10 to 15 meters and see these beautiful",
          "We had full day in Monaco, but saw what we wanted to see. Decided to visit Oceanographic Museum. Excellent choice for adult and children alike. Beautiful location in Monaco-Ville, great viewing all varieties of fish. Not really an aquarium guy, but loved this. Also opportunity",
          "I make a point of visiting museums - all over the world. Having had this one on my bucket list for the past 30 years, perhaps I was expecting too much. Methinks it living on past laurels. By today's standards of museum display, this not at all what it should be. Jacques",
          "Really enjoyed! Set out great with many varieties of sea life. Suitable for the whole family. Upstairs skeleton display is excellent!",
          "Visited independently while our ship was in port for the day. This aquarium was absolutely stunning and the variety of fish was astonishing.There was so much to take in and it was a joy to see the turtles, sharks and beautiful fish all swimming along quite happily together. It",
          "The aquatic life exhibits alone are worth the price of admission. But there's also a collection of sea life skeletons and other collected life and an excellent collection of the \"tools of the trade\" circa early 1900s. Also, the view of Monaco from the roof is very good.",
          "Didn\u2019t go inside but this is one spectacular building looking like it is been out of the rock face! Worth a visit without a doubt- bit of a climb but worth it",
          "Very impressive exhibition. Not a very long visit, one hour max. Great coffee at the coffee machine.",
          "Although I\u2019ve been in Monaco many times this was my first experience of the museum. There is a wide range of interesting creatures to see in pleasant surroundings with an array of information on what\u2019s displayed. On the upper floors the exhibits give you an insight on the",
          "The venue of the place is amazing. A big monumental building on the edge of a cliff. Visit costed 11\u20ac for a student incl. visit to the royal palace. Aquarium was great with the sharks and everything. We saw lots of information and intresting stuff for the kids too! Air condition",
          "We loved the museum. Such a good variety of animals to see and the content is presented really nicely. Great for adults and children!",
          "Sheltering from some unseasonal weather , we visited this remarkable collection and came away most impressed. The building itself is worthy of note overhanging the sea whilst inside the collection features many and varied species of sealife. Spacious rooms and corridors meant",
          "This is our second trip to the museum whilst on a trip to Monaco and highly recommend. It is is well maintained, in a spectacular position and the displays are informative and interesting. The children (and adults!) really enjoyed visiting here, an enjoyable place to come.",
          "A good mixture of things to see from an aquarium displaying jellyfish and sharks to skeletons of whales and dolphins.",
          "Does not have to be the biggest ,but is one of the best taken care off. Excellent species, well preserved, and a lot of history Jacques Cousteau famous oceanographer is part of it.Nice Evening!!",
          "The exhibits here are spectacular!!!! You can see thousands of fish types in more or less natural habitats - as natural as you can get for being in a large glass enclosed tank. The non-fish exhibits are neat bits of history to pique your curiosity. The elevator may be somewhat",
          "We only ended up here as it was raining. Not really my thing but was pleasantly surprised. Excellent displays and the view from the roof is worth a visit.",
          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is one of the best aquariums in Europe. On top of that it is situated in a very beautiful building which claims from its roof one of the best views of Monaco! Especially kids always love it!!",
          "Magnificent architecture and picturesque mosaic floors! Surely a true labour of love to create such beauty! It was a delight to the senses to see the colourful fish and other species of marine life swimming around and gliding passed each other with ease. Even the odd looking",
          "The museum is built into the sheer cliff face rising from the sea, quite a feat of engineering! The aquarium is sited in the basement and is home to multitudes of rare fish with lighted displays of living coral. Sharks, rays and moray eels are well represented with the largest",
          "Stopped here on our day trip from Nice. Great way to spend an hour or two. Very well laid out aquarium in the basement. Didn't get to see much of the other floors, but there was a great exhibition of different shades of the oceans from around the world.",
          "We initially thought that as adults there will not be much to engage our interest. But we were proved wrong. We took our time watching the aquarium and then were pleased to see a light, sound and motion show of the exhibits on the top. We were amazed at the species of fish and",
          "Surprisingly good selection of sights inside. Lovely views from the top of the Museum too. Quite bit of Maritime history there as well which I wasnt expecting. Well worth a visit",
          "First to know: the aquarium proper exists at the base of this big, beautiful building, and the space it does occupy is not large. The walkways are not wide and, with a few exceptions, the tank displays are not big. All this means that if you pick the wrong day to visit, as",
          "Wonderful views, a lot of new information a little bit crowded. Very nice species of fishes, I was amazed",
          "We went to visit this attraction and my husband was in the queue fro tickets. I have additional needs and needed to visit the bathroom whilst he was in the queue. I explained this (in French) to the person on the door and showed them the medical card that I have been issued",
          "Unfortunately, due to having blisters we didn't feel up to any more visits to museums etc so we missed what I am led to believe was a good experience, however outside was a 'yellow submarine' for 2 people. Comments on the submarine referring to the Beatles Song. Will definitely",
          "We do think it was worth to visit. A lot to see in a rather small place. Sometimes it can be crowded. Glad we did this.",
          "The cisit of the aquariums is really nice, the kids really enjoyed it. The terrasse on the top floor is also worth a visit with a nice view. The walk around the museum is also nice, up to the palace. The museum has a big diversity and you can touch the fishes if you book it.",
          "very small collection, for adults not worth it. You ll be finish in 15 mins. don't waste your time, its popular because of limited to do in monaco...",
          "As a family we all enjoyed visiting the aquarium. We were there for about 2 hours. The area that it is in is next to the palace with plenty more to see and nice quaint streets with cafes and eateries. Enjoy!",
          "Aquarium's are ten a penny and the Monaco Oceanographic Museum contains nothing exceptional. It is, however, in the most stunning building and it is worth a visit to see the stunning building.",
          "This was a wonderful aquarium/museum. There were lots of little aquariums and not many big ones (but there is one huge one that you could spend a long time at!), but the quality was excellent. The museum is also very interesting, and the rooftop area with restaurant, cafe, small",
          "Before visiting the aquariums, which are small but full of interesting creatures, a visit to the section that recounts the exploration and discoveries made in the early 20th century is most interesting. Not to miss the bathysphere in the entrance!",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours for adults and kids alike. All the exhibits are interactive and the kids enjoyed using the touch screens to find out more about the animals. The room of artefacts, old photos, skeletons and sea creatures in jars was also really",
          "My family and I recently visited the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco while on holiday in Antibes and I'm so glad we did. The museum is simply world class. What an awesome experience watching sea life in close proximity! And what a variety of fish and other creatures that live in",
          "The Museum is really nice and relaxing, has beautiful and interesting rooms as for example the Whale room. Unfortunately we arrived late at Monaco and consequently at the Museum and didn\u2019t have the chance to visit the Museum completely. Around 18:40 they announced that Museum",
          "Nice for a one and half hour diversion, pleasant and visited for free off season as part of the \u2018Passport to Monaco\u2019 deal which is avail off season. Nice but there are better facilities of this type around the world - my advice is if it\u2019s free visit , if not use the money for",
          "Spent about 2 hours here exploring the tanks and museum, beautiful building on the coast and stunning fish and exhibits. Will definitely keep anyone of any age occupied for the time of the visit. About 10 Euro entry (not sure as had free tickets) but worth the money you would",
          "We came here easter weekend so it was rather packed with masses of children but it was good. The exhibits were good and the aquarium was well set out. The building itself is amazing built into the rock face. The views from the roof terrace were great. An enjoyable visit.",
          "The museum is special really special. You have to see it to believe it. Allow 2 hours for visit. So many beautiful underwater tanks full of the delights of the ocean,sharks and unusual fish species. The upper floors house collections of fish and fossils etc. A must do in",
          "Great view inside and out. Great fish and information and history. Building is super cool and grab some lunch on roof.",
          "Visited this Museum on a rainy day so no chance enjoy the view from the roof but the exhibits are great. A must visit place for Monaco for me.",
          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is a fantastic, diverse museum and is beautifully curated. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The lower levels consist of an intimate yet stimulating Aquarium, whilst the upper levels contain the oceanographic museum, including replicas of historic",
          "Took us about an hour to do the whole thing, lots of different fishes/sharks in a huge tank - nice day out especially for younger ones",
          "I see a lot of reviewers complaining about the small size of this aquarium, but it's important to remember that this is an Oceanographic museum first and foremost so the majority of the exhibits are actually focused on the history of ocean-study. This includes boat and submarine",
          "There\u2019s was a lot to see here including the beauty of the museum itself! Well curated and had a lot to see from live animals to whale skeletons to antique oceanic equipment. Definitely worth the admission!",
          "We visited the aquarium during our day in Monaco as we had done most things on our itinerary in the morning. There was no line so we were able to buy tickets and head straight in. I thought it was a good aquarium with both big and small exhibits with good explanations of the",
          "Had a lovely walk around this magical place, great way to spend a few hours and relax as you learn all about the Ocean.",
          "In addition that the museum is a world class, the actual architecture against the backdrop of the Mediterranean Sea is heart melting! Also be sure to spend time in the Saint-Martin gardens next by, as well as watch a show at the summer cinema on the other side a few stairs",
          "Yes, it\u2019s an amazing sight, but the displays are so close together and cramped! My children were quite upset by how little the space was for sea creatures in their unnatural environment. It\u2019s not very friendly on the pocket either!",
          "The mus\u00e9e is located near the Palace which is a plus as one can visit many sights at once. The entrance fee is too high for what is inside though. Having visited aquariums and exhibits of this kind the world over, I found basics, like a brochure explaining what was where,",
          "We went here on a rainy Saturday afternoon and weren't disappointed. You can go around the entire place within an hour, so maybe a bit pricey. However it is very colourful and has beautiful sea life.",
          "We really enjoyed ourselves in this marvelous underwater world. Sharks, octopus, crabs, seaurchins, jellyfish and fishes from all over the world. Takealook at this place especially if you have children with you. Trust me it will be your best gateway!",
          "This was a nice aquarium, surprisingly good for such a small place. Lots to see, great selection of creatures and information.",
          "Amazing and worth seeing!! Absolutely gorgeous and definitely worth it. Able to take lots of pictures.",
          "The Aquarium and its museum galleries offer one of the richest experiences of the sea through an expansive collection of sketches, models, studies and fish varieties . You should definitely visit it!",
          "Unless it is pouring with rain outside I wouldn't bother. The displays of fish are on the ground floor. Compared to other aquariums around the world this is quite poor re the displays. Most of the tanks seem far too small for the amount of fish or size of fish in them.",
          "We went to the museum to check out what kind of displays they would have and were not disappointed. I particularly liked the displays of underwater exploration gear through the years and the specimens collected in the early 20th Century. There are plenty of live aquatic displays",
          "We truly enjoyed our visit to the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The tanks were well kept, and there was a large variety of very healthy and colorful fish to view. There were many families and children lingering at each of the tanks. The preserved specimens in the museum",
          "In short, it is a place worth visiting, as it has a lot of interesting and fun things to be seen. Interactive, highly enjoyable, and educational, particularly for kids.",
          "It is a must in Monaco. You can visit bigger, better, newer oceanographic museums around the world, but this old iconic museum has a feeling of its own. You can combine the visit to the museum with that to the palace and... here you are! One whole day covered!",
          "Nice place !!! You will discover the wonders of the sea which Principalty of Monaco help to preserve. It is so refreshing to get there, you jump in a wonderfull world and you feel much better.",
          "We visited the Museum as an escape from the rain (yes, it does rain in Monaco!) and we were not disappointed by the displays. All the fish appeared in good health and the large tank where you can sit and watch the sharks, turtles and plethora of fish swimming around is",
          "Honestly speaking we were not aware about the presence of the museum when we visited Monaco, we found it occasionally walking in the upper part of the city. The museum has to lower levels, where there are the pools with all the fishes, the variety and the quantity are very high,",
          "I am not the biggest fan of the ocean because the idea of something swimming up to me kind of freaks me out. It is cool to see all the creatures and the devices people have used through the years to better explore and understand.",
          "While I expected the aquarium to be a little bigger, it was a great place to visit for an hour or so. Definitely worth a visit, if you have time to spare",
          "Quite impressive with good parts and areas for all ages. Large play area for kids on the roof. Nice old building.",
          "The Aquarium on the lower levels is great. It is well maintained, the fish look happy, and there's a decent variety. The museum on the second floor is interesting. It feels like someone raided Jacques Cousteau's home and put everything on display. It's interesting stuff but not",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon here exploring We started at the top floor and worked our way down which meant we saw the museum part first and finished with the excellent aquarium. I was extremely surprised how large the exhibit was, and felt the information screens at each",
          "After watching The Changing of The Guards at The Palace we took the short walk to this museum. What a fantastic building. Inside you walk downstairs to a really spectacular aquarium. Then upstairs to a historical area and then up to the roof terrace where there is a restaurant",
          "The basement section of the museum houses a great number of aquariums containing the oddest and most amazing sea creatures imaginable that swim right past you. The well-chosen lighting combinations highlight that which is shown spectacularly. Adults of all ages who normally",
          "Loved looking at the aquariums, really well showcased . Good value for money. Interesting displays with English translations",
          "My husband wanted to visit, and whilst I appreciate the beauty of the building I hate seeing dead, stuffed birds/fish etc in cabinets. Also felt some of the fish in the aquarium were really squashed in too small a tank, especially the octopus and lobster. I\u2019d have loved to",
          "If you got time in Monaco and sea science interest you this could be a place to visit. Had an museum of the expedition the Prince Albert 1 made back in the old days, art of the sea and an aquarium. The building was gorgeous constructed.",
          "We visited a number of museums throughout our visit, this was by far the best. We purchased adult tickets from the tourist information in Nice which catered for a number of attractions, we paid for children at museum. Displays were relevant, up to date and well maintained. All",
          "This museum does a great job of showcasing a multitude of exotic sea life. It all started when Albert I hired Jacques Cousteau to help build the aquarium in the very early 1900\u2019s. This place is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Amazing location os museum! Very beautiful, always nice to come back with children of without. Aquarium of two floors really beautiful. Other 3 floors more educational with museum. On the top floor bar have nice food and drinks with amazing view of All Monaco. Recommend to any",
          "Lovely museum with interesting sights and facts. Spent around 3 hours walking through the different areas. Lovely views from the outdoor deck at the top. Aquarium is gorgeous!",
          "Whether you are into the natural world or not this is a must see place. Well laid out for viewing every imaginable species of marine life and so much information. Also a good museum in the same building and a rooftop view of Monaco to die for. Plus good food at a reasonable",
          "We popped to monaco for the day before our evening flight home and decided to give this a go, really easy transport from the train station, just hop on the number 2 outside the station and it takes you to the monaco ville which is then a 2 minute walk to the aquarium. Good price",
          "This was a great place to visit, We really enjoyed the history behind the aquarium and all the artifacts in the building",
          "The museum is avoidable specially keeping in mind that there are many other things to do in Monte Carlo. The only positive of the visit was the location of the museum was the location (by the sea) and the roof top restaurant which is good for a relaxed afternoon lunch",
          "An incredible experience, this well designed presentation is a treat. The larger sea life is shown in huge tanks, and the smaller seahorses and jelly fish are presented in an up-close manner with variable lighting offering a unique experience. Not well sign posted, the location",
          "There's a yellow submarine outside the museum and evokes the beatles song! It was so cute and while on the tour we stood outside to sing the tune. The building itself is gorgeous and huge and oh so clean. Nothing in Monaco seems to see any dirt! Wish we would have had time",
          "I\u2019ve developped the habit of visiting the Museum almost every year for the past 15 years. I can say with certainty that it has never stopped surprising me. Over the years, Monaco keeps investing its time and energy in this beautiful structure, which is for me the best museum in",
          "Nipped in here on the off chance and it was just brilliant. The building itself just looks great and as son as you get inside there's a large sculpture of a tree ahead of some huge shelving with jars of nautical things in. The aquarium is large with the centre piece being a huge",
          "Compared very well to some of the best aquariums around the world. Wanted to buy a lot more souvenirs but staff was to rude and disrespectful to give them my money.",
          "If you are in Monaco, you simply must visit this place. Provides great insight in Monaco's strong engagement in and support of oceanographic exploration and the imperative of ocean conservation. Fabulous exhibits and an amazing rooftop terrace with views of the Mediterranean and",
          "We did not visit the museum part of the attraction, just the aquarium, as my mum was getting tired. But even just the aquarium is plenty to see. The Musee Oceanographique de Monaco is not a world-renouned attraction for nothing. From huge sharks to tiny seahorses, there is",
          "Perched on top of the cliffs in an impressive building it provides an excellent insight to the oceans and oceanography along with a spectacular aquarium, with plenty of multilingual interactive services. A trip to the roof terrace gives some spectacular views. Well worth a",
          "If you or your family like aquariums or memorabilia about the ocean, this is the place. It's a lovely aquarium, not massive but big enough. Each tank has digital display info in a variety of languages to learn about the fish and creatures you see. There are 5 floors, the lower 2",
          "Beautiful building with a fantastic view. nice aquarium with separate fish-tanks according fish's grouping. Must be visited.",
          "Monaco...oceanography...Jacques Cousteau! Well, err not exactly and, if you're expecting to learn about Cousteau's work you'll be disappointed - they have his yellow submarine and his name is on the list of past directors inside the door but that's about it. Also, if they are",
          "One of the best experiences. Perfect for sea lovers, nature lovers or just people who want to explore more. The building is amazing, the history presented in the museum unique.",
          "Nice to visit as it is next door to the Prince palace. The aquarium is small but interesting. The museum is not intended to the neophytes. A few minutes away walk from the palace thru a nice park with great views of the marinas, the town, etc...",
          "Small and simple museum and aquarium. Nothing really interesting. But for little Monaco I think it's enough",
          "Oceanographic Museum is a very interesting place, first for its history being created by one of its princes, Prince Albert and also had Jacques Cousteau as Director ! Architecture is beautiful and most interesting is see how Museum was built in a cliff. Aquarium is wonderful",
          "It is one of the best aquariums i have been. So many unusual species which I haven't seen before. Well presented. Strongly recommend it.",
          "Nice aquariums with different species, best of all for me aquarium with hunderds of clauns fish \"NEMO\", i could site there and relax forever. I expected it to be bigger. Price included in Riviera pass. Dont forget to make photo with shark on the roof :)",
          "The experience and money are worth it here. There are about four floors in the building, with amazing exhibit showcases, not only living marines but also specimens.",
          "We had a great time in it like 2 big kids:)) Very informative and very well displayed. Sharks were our favourite!",
          "An amazing collection of oceanographic memorabilia, specimens and information. The aquariums are filled with exotic fish and creatures and if that isn\u2019t enough then the building alone will impress. Well worth the effort of traipsing up the hill passing the palace as you go.",
          "We were very impressed by both the six story building and the viewing tanks of Mediterranean and coral reef fishes. Use the elevator and save your knees.",
          "This wonderful building is in two halves. The first and better half is the stunning aquaria that make up the bottom two floors of the building and which house some spectacular creatures. This element alone is well worth the entrance fee. The other half of the building is a",
          "This was actually built by a Prince of Monaco to study the ocean. There are many fish preserved from the early 1900's along the walls. I purchased a combination ticket of the Palace Tour and this Museum. The total cost was 19 EUR for both. I am not sure exactly what the prices",
          "The kids really wanted to visit here so we did. Prices were high considering what you saw. Very very busy and adults were not considerate toward children wanting to see. Not much to look at although our children were happy and I'm glad it didn't take too long to go through I",
          "Enjoyed the aquarium on the ground floor and the museums on the upper floors. Impressive exterior of building. Had lunch on the rooftop. Wonderful views of the port and city.",
          "The museum is very dry and unless you have a real interest in Oceanographic history then probably not worth more than 30 minutes. The aquarium is a different story! A fantastic array of dazzling fish in a very well thought out display. I would visit again.",
          "Visited this museum in Monaco which I fullheartedly recommend maybe especially when yoy bring kids. The best of all is that the entrance pay is not expensive compared to what you see.",
          "Good range of fish species in a variety of tanks that seemed well maintained. Kind of sad to see a lone loggerhead turtle though.",
          "Save your money! We might have enjoyed it if adequate explanation of the exhibit would have been offered. Unfortunately, we didn't even learn there was a film until we had exited through the gift shop. We were not allowed to re-enter the museum once in the gift shop. Once",
          "Plan an entire day here to see the exhibits. Have lunch in the Oceanographic rooftop cafeteria. Remember to visit the gift shop. Videos come out clearly of the aquarium tanks.",
          "Granddaughter adored this place, she absolutely loved seeing the sharks, the octopus, the jelly fish and sea horses. I thought Nemo and Dory would be the highlights but she hasn't stopped talking about all of the other things she saw. The other floors of this stunning",
          "Loved it!!! Great for all ages. My mother was so happy we visited. The fish were beautiful. Don't miss this in Monaco.",
          "We booked tickets to the Aquarium and didn't book tickets to the palace I now wish we did, we didn't have any kids with us and I have read reviews that say they spent half a day there, I just can not see how !! It's ok it's not great, I expected so much from such a magnificent",
          "We bought a French Riviera pass which included the wonderful museum. The fish and coral displays were amazing. We learnt a lot and enjoyed all the exhibitions. The multitude of clown fish, the jelly fish, the eels and don't miss the light show on the 1st floor...on the hour",
          "On a recent trip to Nice, a visit to Monaco was always going to be a must and having researched attractions, other than the casino/cars etc, this was one, And i can see why. Housed in a fantastic building it houses various vast tanks with all manner of species,A well maintained",
          "We visited this venue during a one day stop in the Principality and enjoyed every minute of it. It is housed in a Baroque inspired building which in itself is impressive but the inside is where the real treasure lies. For us, the massive aquarium and the many smaller ones housed",
          "Went here mostly because of the shark pool and it was great!. But because we were not so into all the other things, the price of 16 euros was quite a lot in my opinion. On the other hand I understand that it costs a lot of money to keep everything in order. Views from the upper",
          "We took the train from Nice (only buy a one way ticket if you are unsure of your return time) once in Monaco (about 20 mins) walk outside saint devote exit and catch bus ( very frequent) ask for the Oceanic Museum. When you get off the bus the museum is very close by. Buy a",
          "At 14 euro per adult a tad pricey but our kids under 2 were free , Not buggy friendly at all, had to carry stroller up steps while staff looked on. Aquarium was nice but again they might think about making them floor to ceiling so the kids could view easier. Didn't go to",
          "This is impressive from the outside inwards. It's a big building which allows plenty of space to build some fantastic displays of all types of marine life. Don't rush it. Take your time and appreciate the amount of effort and care that has gone into achieving this level of",
          "Everyone who visits Monaco should see the oceanographic museum. A really nice building that has a aquarium with a big number of sea species and also two floors that you will learn and see everything that discovered zak yves cousteau. A big collection of animal species, photos,",
          "Read and heard rave reviews about this place. Bit underwhelmed to be honest. Aquarium part same as any other. History bit is okay..... Views from roof are nice.",
          "My wife and I are used to visit Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique de Monaco everytime we are staying in this beautiful city. As always, we came and enjoyed our stay with this little visit made in August 2017, have a look to the photos I'll post, in order for you to see how it looks like",
          "If you've been to some of the big name aquariums in the U.S. or the world, such as the Georgia Aquarium, National Aquarium in Baltimore, and/or Monterey Bay Aquarium, you will likely be disappointed here (unless you are a big-time aquarium/marine life exhibit enthusiast).",
          "Somehow my son felt in love with this museum 10 years ago and now- every year we are coming back - somehow it already feels like obligation to visit our \"fish family\". For adults it is really great to visit this museum once, for kids and probably not kids anymore it is something",
          "We heard about this place everywhere and it was in our to do list while staying in Cannes. So we took a train to Monaco to see the museum. It was pretty small aquarium with fishes and just one floor, so the rest 2 floors was with some other nor exiting things, like shells,",
          "Not great if you compare it to other aquariums around the world and ridiculously expensive for what it is. If you've frequented the likes of the Dubai aquarium, SEA in Singapore or the Two Oceans in Cape Town then give this one a miss.",
          "We visited in August and we really enjoyed looking at all the different species of fish. Next to each display there is a touch screen and you can choose your language and you can see the information related to that particular fish. The aquariums are located at the bottom",
          "A very nice aquarium with many different spiecies. The museum in it self isnt too interesting though.",
          "Lovely aquarium and especially love the Hawaian fish Humuhumunukunukuapua`a. My daughter is very keen on marine biology and it was certainly a trip worth taking. It's also air conditioned which is a perfect place to be on a scorching August dat. Certainly worth a visit when",
          "I've heard about this Oceanographic Museum everywhere so I decided to visit it. Turns out to be very disappointing. Tickets are overpriced. The aquarium is very small (only one floor made of 3 rooms for fish when the building has 4 giant floors) compared to others and really",
          "This is a very famous Museum that you must visit if you are in Monaco. The building and the way it design looks terrific , most of the creature here are beautiful. I could have spend all day long just to stand there and look at them, what a beautiful....",
          "We did not plan our visit ahead and picked up our tickets immediately. Somewhat crowded, but still worth viewing the impressive assortment and diversity of educational exhibits. Our 11 and 13 year olds both enjoyed it! Yes, perhaps some of the tanks were smaller however you were",
          "This must be one of the best aquarium visitor sites around. The research activities, and the marine protection role are very important.",
          "We enjoyed the time spent at the Museum. The Museum was clean but we also agreed with some of the previous comments about some fish tanks being very small, we felt a bit sad for some of the fish. The building is beautiful, very impressive.",
          "Long queues for everything, toilets are filthy. To many people inside the building (more than fish!). High prices! There are so many better places to go as a family.",
          "Great museum situated on the mythical rock of Monaco.interesting and fun especially for the kids and a nice learning experience for adults,too.The only drawback we had to queue quite long for the tickets.",
          "The museum has an impressive display of marine life and is very informative. Sadly, when crowded, you can barely move from one display to another and the accessibility (for baby strollers) is limited.",
          "This is a very famous museum and if you are in Monaco it's a must see. The building is majestic and the vision that created it is so relevant now. The Aquarium is small and nothing spectacular but the rest of the museum is fascinating. The upper terrace offer amazing views, a",
          "I visited today. It was overcrowded and the actual aquarium is tiny compared to many basic ones in the UK. To add insult to injury \"restaurant and cafe\" on the roof were like something out of the 1970's and at 2pm were unable to serve us for 20 mins as it would appear they",
          "We visited the museum with our two kids. The kids were very happy. Also we saw a large variety of sea and water animals that they are located around the globe. Indeed the collection is exceptional. Also the museum is located in ideal place in the top of the rock with excellent",
          "Well...one of the best museums I have ever seen....Beautiful museum in fantastic building, where you can observe whole coast of this tiny country from the top of the roof. The best part, especially for children, is the lower level of museum, where you can find really huge",
          "The building itself is impressive but the aquarium is disappointing. Some tanks are way too small for their inhabitants. The cafe on the top floor is terrible, the staff have nothing but contempt for the customers. I haven't had service this bad in a long time, we won't be back.",
          "It was fun. We saw the aquarium and the museum. Both were not the best I've been to. A great destination for families with kids.",
          "We arrved shortly after opening, it was quiet and we could see all the aquarium tanks easily with no crowds. Each tank has a screen above to tell you what the different species are and most have an ipad that gives further information in a choice of languages. We then went up",
          "It was Really busy. Walking in the line from aquarium to aquarium. Anyway kids had a good time so I had too.",
          "A very recommended visit for all ages and interests. Tip: Get the dual ticket to visit the Palace at a discount rate.",
          "I visited the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco on the basis of a business report. Quite informative and had electronics displays at each tank, so you can learn about all the species that live there. If I can remember correctly, all of the animals are born and raised in the",
          "I've visited this place as a kid and went back with my wife during our holiday. It was a feast of recognition having done some snorkeling in Malaysia we recognized lots of fish. The shark tank is especially impressive with multiple reef sharks and turtles. The tropical aquarium",
          "On a recent cruise we called into Monaco. We had the morning free and my wife found a leaflet about the Oceanographic Museum. What a lucky find. Inside a fabulous building housed with the Museum of Monaco, this is a great attraction. There is an aquarium with everything from",
          "After being dazzled by the palace, the Oceanographic museum could have disappointed. It did not. One of a kind species, multiple floors, interactive exhibits, and an absolutely palatial structure made this place a world class aquarium for me. My teen daughter loved it too!",
          "Our kids really wanted to visit the Oceanographic musium of Monaco, not the biggest but still nice and fun. I would recommend it if you have a few hours and love the",
          "This is such an interesting place in Monaco, and neither am I nor my partner are particularly fond of fish. However, we saw such a variety of stunning fish that we left the museum completely amazed. Definitely worth a visit!!!!",
          "First word of warning is that getting to the museum on foot is a fair uphill slog, especially on a hot day like we had. Aquarium is really good and well looked after. The museum is actually very interesting (I'm not a big museum fan) and we happened to catch it on a day where a",
          "Recommended! When driving there make sure you plan parking garage because the police blocks roads. The kiosk nearby is quite pricy.",
          "We were really desappointed by the lack of air, the heat inside and the bad smell in some areas of the aquarium which is in the basement of the building No sunlight, no window, no natural light for the animals inside small tanks We were very sad for the hippocampus which were",
          "I'm not usually the type to visit aquariums but we found ourselves with a few hours to spare in Monte Carlo so we decided to check out the Oceanographic Museum - it was fantastic ! So many stunning sea creatures to see up close, I had a grin on my face the entire time I spent",
          "I went with my sister while in Monaco for a few hours but could have spent so much longer there. The building first of all was so beautiful, the aquarium was great with good up to date exhibits and great husbandry. The museum was so interesting with unusual skeletons that I've",
          "We truly enjoyed seeing the Ocean Museum. It is more like an Aquarium and has some beautiful exhibits. It is a must see while in Monte Carlo. It is one of the stops on the Hop on Hop off bus so it is easy to reach. There were also people on a shore excursion from cruises so",
          "Wanted to show my son the old town and the museum as it is an impressive location. the actual museum is a great place, with an impressive aquarium display. However, after an hour, you are done, and its not cheap.",
          "Well what a place. It is not big but neither is it expensive. I am an aquarium lover and have visited many throughout the world. This one is not the best but far from the worst. I have been more than once and would go again. Sea life is amazing, it is very possible that is where",
          "A nice way to spend a morning or afternoon and it's a lovely aquarium. Not as good as many others around the world but pretty good for it's size and location. Nice and cool in there in summer and took lots of photos. There is also a more maritime section upstairs but that is not",
          "We visited the Oceanographic Museum and to be honest even though you do get to see some beautiful fish it was expensive for what it was. It costs 16 Euro each and for what you got I would not suggest that you go",
          "Reasonably priced for expensive Monaco. Interactive displays in multiple languages. Nice views from the rooftop. Great for families.",
          "\"Why do we seek to conquer space, when seven-tenths of our universe remains to be explored?\" So said Stromberg (Curt Jurgens) in my favourite film, The Spy Who Loved Me. Of course, by seven-tenths of our universe, he's referring to the sea. Wandering around The Musee",
          "The last thing I thought I would do in the quaint country of Monaco was visit an Aquarium, but it ended up being one of the highlights of our European vacation. What an astounding collection of marine life--sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish and fish like I have never seen before.",
          "I went with my family. All my kids aged 8, 7 and 2 were amused with the amount of fish we saw.. Allow 1.5 hours to see most of the museum.",
          "I enjoyed very much the visit of this museum, even if I am not a specialist. But, it is arranged so well for experts and for common people. You can spend a whole day there to visit all rooms and all curiosities. I am certainly coming back.",
          "This museum is good for people who love sea animals. There are a lot of species in the aquarium and they provide some facts about some species which is kinda helpful to study and learn.",

          "It is places in the Old part of Monaco right on the edge of a cliff. You can spot many species of marine creatures and fish, including live interactions with sharks. On the second floor there is a museum with very old artifacts, tools and whale skeletons. The price is about 7",
          "This museum and aquarium only takes an hour or so to enjoy. It is a beautiful setting, educational and benefits their work on behalf of oceans. Wonderful!",
          "The Oceanographic museum has lots to offer for all ages. Clean environment and friendly staff. Everything is in French so it was difficult for us to read about all the different animals but that is to be expected in another country! No complaints!",

          "It was a real treat to come and see all the different types of fish here. The aquarium is very well organised, very clean and there is a lot to see. There is also a museum which is very informative as well. A very nice gift shop too. When we went there was also an art exhibition",
          "The combination of the aquariums and the museum itself is very nice. We have already visited multiple aquariums in Europe and in comparison, the aquariums in the oceanographic museum have a nice setting and are well taken care off. We however had the impression that the tank",

          "For fourteen euros you get an interesting insight to the origins of the museum. The exhibits both in the aquarium and the museum are well presented and interesting. There's a display of items found 'beneath' the sea which is unusual and a section of preserved items from recent",
          "We visited this attraction as part of a combined ticket which included the Jardin Exotique gardens.This will save you a few euros. The aquarium, although not large has very well presented fish tanks with some very unusual species that we had not come across before. Although we",
          "Wow, worth every penny 14 Euros to be exact, a fabulous experience within the compounds of the palace.",
          "What a wonderful place it was. Such beautiful fish. Very informative bright and alive. A great display is sea creatures and fish both alive and dead. A good sample of the barrier reef and it inhabited species on display,",
          "I love aquariums, and this was no exception. The fish seemed comfortable in their tanks, which is very important to me. There is an opportunity to touch alive sharks, which was exciting. I feel bad for the sharks, but how could I let that chance go away? Many types of",
          "Like everything in Monaco the aquarium was smaller than I expected but presented in a good way and still had a wide range of fish and marine animals such as sharks, octopuses and turtles. The two lower floors for the aquarium then a museum is on the upper floor with a roof",
          "I don't know what I expected when we visited the museum but I have to say it was absolutely amazing. The aquarium area was wonderful. I'm sure children would love it. We combined the visit with a trip to the Palace. It's great value if you by the Combined ticket. 19euros to",
          "This had been built up by some friends as an aquarium rather than a museum. There is a small aquarium portion, but it is mostly a museum.",
          "My husband and I weren't planning on visiting, but after so many of the guide books pointing us here, we thought it would be worth it. It was really busy when we went (Easter weekend!) but this is great for families & for couples to spend a few hours. Just don't get too excited",
          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is housed in a beautiful building overlooking the Mediterranean. When I visited in May the building also was the site of an interesting sculpture exhibition, and I imagine that on most visits you will see more than sea life. The aquarium is",

          "great place to spend some time with your family, especially the kids loved the under water world experience.",
          "You don't only get to see marine life but also to admire Monaco's architecture! Getting to the museum was a bit difficult because the GPS doesn't understand you need to park in a parking garage first and then walk to the museum.",
          "My 9-year old absolutely enjoyed this visit. There is a good variety of marine animals from sea anemones to turtles and sharks. There are some very weird specimens, the names of which I don\u2019t recall. The tanks are well arranged. The lighting is dim, allowing a good focus on",
          "The building itself is absolutely stunning and sits atop a hill on the way up to the castle. It can be quite a strenuous walk so would recommend public transport if coming here. The price of admission was 14 Euros each which was fair for what was on offer. Bottom floor (-2) was",

          "Excellent place to go if you visit Monte-Carlo. Good for kids, families and couples too. Very beautiful and clean place.",
          "This was a nice museum however not the most captivating in size or content. It is worth going to kill a few hours, however, be aware it will be over quicker than you think. We ran out of fish/museum quite suddenly.",
          "Usually I visit aquariums in zoo, but for this one, I heard that it's ''must to see it'' when you are in MC. And it worth to visit it. It isn't very spectacular, but far to be boring. It has a lot of various interesting and rare animals.",
          "My husband really wanted to visit the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, i was indifferent. I have to say that i was just as impressed about everything as my husband was. I think the aquarium was the best but the whale skeletons are also pretty amazing. Oh and the baby turtles",
          "We got a pass that granted us entry intp the palace and the acquarium. The acquarium had a lovely collection of aquatic life. Description of it was displayed in French and also in English. Was a very enjoyable time, but not a 'don' t miss' kind of an attraction.",
          "Nice aquarium, near the Palace you can arrange to visit both. Sharks, big turtles, piranhas, tropical fishes... Worth it",
          "Nice museum in the center of Monaco. Sharks, turtles, piranhas and tropical fish all together. Worth visiting...",
          "I visited this place as a part of a conference in Nice. This was the social event planned by the LOC and we had a great time here. The complete museum was booked for us and it was nice to have private tour. The baby nemos, or baby sharks and baby jellyfishes were the cutest",
          "I really enjoyed to visit this museum.it is great for adults or kids. Is very well organised and you will be completely stunned by the beautiful life see. There is also a restaurant on the top with very good value food and Burford to have a drink outside when it's sunny.I could",
          "Although this may not be the best aquarium in the world, it is definitely worth visiting as it is not that big and hence should not take >1.5 hr even for a leisurely visit.",
          "You can spend an hour or so, but not more. The aquarium is on a very average level. Lack of signs and texts in English",
          "This place is perched on the very edge of the Med with stunning views from the roof top of both the ocean and the city of monte-Carlo.The aquarium is extensive as are the museum items that document the history of man and the sea. You can combine a ticket for this and the palace,",
          "We found this beautiful museum building very interesting and also really loved the aquarium and its live exhibits. It was a lovely escape for us when it suddenly started raining and kept us dry and entertained for many hours. The aquarium, although not enormous, is in excellent",
          "The legacy of Jacques Cousteau and his great achievements in exploring of oceans secrets. Good place to enjoy undersea creatures and enjoy the views from the top of MC.",
          "I loved seeing all of the different species of underwater creatures! I thought this would be a small attraction but it was huge there was so much too see and a museum right next door! The turtles were lovely and the sharks are just something else! And a fair price to see such",
          "This place is really fun. The restaurant is great. Good views. Nice staff. Great fish. I spent a great afternoon here.",
          "The best bit of the museum is definitely the aquarium. The building itself is beautiful and you have to give them credit for the way it was built right into the rock, using every last bit of land. However unless you are really interested in the history of how the sea has been",
          "Found this to be just ok, the access to the museum is bit odd as there is no clear indication for entry. But if you decide to walk then it is a nice walk",
          "I recommend this aquarium, due to it's reasonable pricing and range of aquatic life. However, the other floors currently appear to have work being done and so there are only two floors of 5 that can be accessed and enjoyed properly.",
          "it is nice, but honestly nothing special, and if you've been to the acquarium in Valencia, just leave it!",
          "Very wonderful building with loads of nautical designs in the building itself as well as its exhibits from fish to shells and native sea art, also nice restaurant and views on the roof",
          "The first oceanographic museum I've ever visited in the 90's. I returned to Monte Carlo recently and this museum is still the best of its kind I've ever been to. Lots of fish and other ocean species, interesting facts about the sea life and amazing view from the terrace as a",
          "It was an ok visit, but not something to wow you. The oceanograph is quite small and with no activities, it is kind of boring. The museum on the 2nd and 3rd floor are as plain as you can imagine. No interaction what so ever. The only aquarium that is bigger is the one with the",

          "This is a visit to the aquarium and museum. All the signs are in French and English. The aquarium in my opinion is the best part with beautiful fish to view in many tanks. The museum is more limited but still interesting and tells the story of the princes's collection of",
          "This was a very fun and relaxing time. It was so much more than an aquarium, it was also a great museum and had a nice rooftop restaurant. Very educational and you get to see unique sea life that you can't elsewhere. What I like the most is you can spend as little or much time",
          "Beautifully laid out museum with an aquarium.well worth a visit . Only blot on the visit was the service in the restaurant. We gave up in the end , as did the couple at the next table .",
          "Amazing museum/ aquarium . So many species of fish in lovely displays. Very crowded on Good Friday especially the book store but well worth the visit. Rooftop restaurant was very disappointing.",

          "I visited this museum while I was on a business trip and had some spare time. It was a pleasant surprise to see that the quality of the aquarium was better then expected (i have seen many) The fish seemed very healty and the aquariums are very well taken care off I had a great",
          "This is an excellent aquarium. Plenty of fish from sea horses to sharks. The whole visit takes about 2hrs and the entry fee isn't expensive. We got out ticket at The Palace ticket box both places were included at a discount. Make sure to go around the back of Oceanographic",
          "The Oceanographic museum is worth a visit for the building, alone, but it is truly a gem. The aquarium in the basement was wonderful, with all kinds of colorful fish. But I loved the historic aspects. The diving bell, the maritime artifacts, and the incredible view of the",
          "It is a \"must\" if you come to Monaco, the children love it, l advise all visitors not to miss this opportunity.",
          "We took the train with our children for a short day trip from Nice. We visited both the museum and the palace, and enjoyed both. The aquarium aspect is quite enjoyable - not overtly huge but large enough to have a really good selection of aquatic life/information. The view from",
          "I could've easily spent the whole day there. I will go back for sure next time I am in Monte Carlo. You enter into a world of wonder, very instructive, and fun in the same time.",
          "In a classic area of the city you can find a mix of science and magnifique Explosion of Luxury and beauty",

          "This was an average aquarium. Not very big with straightforward glass windows for viewing. Even the toddler couldn't get very excited. There is a lovely playground on the roof next to a cafe which was probably the best part.",
          "This is my 3th visit to the museum, its really a must go place for anyone visiting the area. Beside the permanent exibits there are temporary onrs that can be fascinating, just few years ago ee experienced one about sharks that was memourable, this time there was the preparation",
          "Absolutely amazing old building that is very spacious inside. One of the best waterlife museums I've been at. They have everything from sharks to crabs to very, very weird fish. The restaurant on the top of the building has an incredible view over the ocean and the city. -",

          "Small but still a really nice place to visit. The kids will love it. All types of marine life that are well organised. Also the views from the top are nice. Not the biggest but still fun. I would recommend it if you have a few hours and love the oceans.",
          "Unique collection of both large and small fishes. Fishes of size of ants can also be seen here. The museum inside the building is average and not a much of attraction though. The building facade is beautiful and sea view to the back side of the building is picturesque. They",

        "wiki": "The Monte Carlo Casino, officially named Casino de Monte-Carlo, is a gambling and entertainment complex located in Monaco. It includes a casino, the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, and the office of Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo.The Casino de Monte-Carlo is owned and operated by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, a public company in which the Monaco government and the ruling royal family have a majority interest. The company also owns the principal hotels, sports clubs, foodservice establishments, and nightclubs throughout the Principality.\nThe citizens of Monaco are forbidden to enter the gaming rooms of the casino.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of opening a gambling casino in Monaco belongs to Princess Caroline, a shrewd, business-minded spouse of Prince Florestan I. Revenues from the proposed venture were supposed to save the House of Grimaldi from bankruptcy. The ruling family's persistent financial problems became especially acute after the loss of tax revenue from two breakaway towns, Menton and Roquebrune, which declared independence from Monaco in 1848 and refused to pay taxes on olive oil and fruit imposed by the Grimaldis.\nIn 1854, Charles, Florestan's son and future Prince of Monaco, recruited a team of Frenchmen\u2014writer Albert Aubert and businessman Napoleon Langlois\u2014to devise a development plan and write a prospectus to attract 4 million francs needed to build a spa for the treatment of various diseases, a gambling casino modeled from the Bad Homburg casino, and English-styled villas. Granted the concession of 30 years to operate a bathing establishment and gaming tables, Aubert and Langlois opened the first casino at 14 December 1856 in Villa Bellevu. Intended to be only a temporary location, the building was a modest mansion in La Condamine.\nIn the late 1850s, Monaco was an unlikely place for a resort to succeed. The lack of roads needed to connect Monaco to Nice and the rest of Europe, and the absence of comfortable accommodations for visitors, as well as the concessionaires' failure to publicize the new resort, resulted in far fewer customers than was originally anticipated. Unable to raise the capital needed to operate the money-losing enterprise, Aubert and Langlois ceded their rights to Frossard de Lilbonne, who in turn passed it to Pierre Auguste Daval in 1857.\n\nDuring this initial period, the casino had been moved several times, until it finally ended up in the area called Les Spelugues (English: The Caves). Construction at this site began on 13 May 1858 to designs of the Parisian architect Gobineau de la Bretonnerie and was completed in 1863. Gobineau de la Bretonnerie also designed the neighboring H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo (constructed in 1862).Although the casino began to make a profit in 1859, Daval was not up to the task. Just like his predecessors, he was incompetent and lacked the ability to bring the gambling enterprise to the scale envisioned by Princess Caroline. Frustrated, she dispatched her private secretary M. Eyneaud to Germany, hoping to recruit Fran\u00e7ois Blanc, a French entrepreneur and operator of the Bad Homburg casino. Blanc declined the offer. It took a lot of time and persuasion on the part of Princess Caroline to convince the Blancs to move to Monaco. Princess Caroline even appealed to Madame Blanc, whom she befriended during her first visit to Bad Homburg, with a suggestion that Monaco's mild climate would be good for Madame Blanc's ill health.\n\nFinally, in 1863 Fran\u00e7ois Blanc agreed to take over Monaco's casino business. To manage the new venture, a company\u2014the Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers\u2014was formed with capital of 15 million francs. Among the prominent investors were Charles-Bonaventure-Fran\u00e7ois Theuret, Bishop of Monaco, and Cardinal Pecci, the future Pope Leo XIII. Blanc became the single majority stockholder in the company and received a 50-year concession, which would last until 1913. Blanc used his connections to quickly raise the required capital, and began the massive construction. On Blanc's insistence, the Spelugues area where the gambling complex was located was renamed to make it sound more attractive to casino visitors. A few suggestions were considered, and the name Monte Carlo was chosen in Prince Charles' honor.\nIn 1878\u201379, the casino building was transformed and expanded to designs of Jules Dutrou (1819\u20131885) and Charles Garnier, the architect who had designed the Paris opera house now known as the Palais Garnier. Fran\u00e7ois Blanc knew Garnier because Blanc had provided a loan of at least 4.9 million gold francs to the cash-strapped government of the French Third Republic, so that the opera house, which had been started in 1861, could be completed. It had finally opened in 1875. The alterations to the Casino de Monte Carlo included the addition of a concert hall (designed by Garnier and later named the Salle Garnier), located on the side of the casino facing the sea, and the redesign and expansion of the gaming rooms and public spaces, mostly carried out by Dutrou on the side of the casino facing the Place du Casino, where the H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo and the  were also located.\n\nIn 1880\u201381, the casino was expanded again, to the east of Dutrou's Moorish Room, by the addition of the Trente-et-Quarante Gaming Room, also designed by Garnier. Subsequent additions and expansions, and the remodeling of the Trente-et-Quarante Gaming Room into the Salle des Am\u00e9ricains, have mostly obliterated Garnier's contributions to this part of the casino, except for some ceiling decorations.  In 1898\u201399, the Salle Garnier was remodeled by architect Henri Schmit, primarily in the stage area, so that it would be more suitable for opera and ballet performances. However, much of Garnier's original facade and the interior design of the auditorium itself remain intact. Despite all of the later additions and modifications, the casino still has a distinctly Beaux Arts style.\nThe most famous example of the gambler's fallacy occurred in a game of roulette at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in the summer of 1913, when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremely uncommon occurrence, although no more nor less common than any of the other 67,108,863 sequences of 26 red or black. Gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an \"imbalance\" in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by a long streak of red. In 1921, the first Women\u2019s Olympiad was held at the casino gardens. \nUntil recently, the Casino de Monte-Carlo has been the primary source of income for the House of Grimaldi and the Monaco economy.\n\n\n== Casino facilities ==\nThe casino has facilities to play a variety of games which include:\n\n\n=== Breaking the bank ===\nIn 1873, Joseph Jagger gained the casino great publicity by \"breaking the bank at Monte Carlo\" by discovering and capitalizing on a bias in one of the casino's roulette wheels. Technically, the bank in this sense was the money kept on the table by the croupier. According to an article in The Times in the late 19th century, it was thus possible to \"break the bank\" several times. The 1892 song \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\", made famous by Charles Coborn, was probably inspired by the exploits of Charles Wells, who \"broke the bank\" on many occasions on the first two of his three trips.\nAccording to the book Busting Vegas by Ben Mezrich, a team of blackjack players recruited from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by team-leader Victor Cassius and Semyon Dukach attempted to break the bank at Monte Carlo with the assistance of a team-play-based system. The book describes how the management of Monte Carlo responded to the success of the team. According to Semyon the account in Busting Vegas is accurate aside from the fact that the team was made up of himself, Andy Bloch and another player he refers to as \"Katie\".\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nJames Bond, a fictional British spy, is often associated with the Casino de Monte-Carlo.\nThe architecture of glamorous Belle \u00c9poque building of the Casino de Monte-Carlo was used by Ian Fleming to describe a casino in \"Royale-Les-Eaux\", a fictional resort featured in Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale (1953).\nMonaco and its casino were the locations for a number of James Bond movies, including Never Say Never Again and GoldenEye, as well as for the \"Casino Royale\" episode of the CBS's Climax! television show.\nThe casino served as a filming location for the 2004 film Ocean's Twelve.\nThe casino makes an appearance in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.\n\n\n== Other mentions ==\nThe Monte Carlo method, a computational approach which relies on repeated random sampling to solve difficult numerical problems, was named after the Casino de Monte-Carlo by physicist Nicholas Metropolis.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCasino Gardens and Terraces\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nBonillo, Jean-Lucien, et al.

          "Beautiful architecture inside. However 17 euro entry (10 euro playing chips) was a little expensive given not a lot of rooms were open to public. Lots of super cars parked outside. Casino Dr Paris is close by and offers some nice games.",

          "Always worth a visit but sadly one can only really gamble with at least 20\u20ac which I only knew when I was already inside. Still a great experience and cool to see the famous Monte Carlo Casino from the inside!",

          "A great experience. It's worth checking out a piece of history. The table prices were affordable. The drinks are delicious and also affordable. I didn't hurt that we ended up winning on the roulette table. You get to live out your inner James Bond and see some history.",
          "Awesome casino in equally awesome surroundings! The building is beautiful, from the inside too. The good thing about the casino for beginners/casual/novice gamblers is that the entry to the slot machine area is free so you can get in, have some fun and get out without much damage :) the cafe de Paris adjacent is a great experience",

          "Very beautiful place! If you are in Monaco, you are obligated to take a look at the casino. You are not obligated to play at the casino, but you can go inside to watch at the decoration, it is like a museum. Also the people from security are friendly, not like a security from London's Grosvenor House Hotel.",
          "Nice place. It\u2019s worth to know, that you can go around the building and enjoy the view to the sea and to the port of Monaco, with some of the biggest yachts in it. If you are into cars, it\u2019s also a good place to visit, as the people who are staying in these hotels are pretty wealthy, and they usually come with their best cars.",

The building is spectacular. it's a great experience but try not to carried away by spending money... it can be tricky!! ps: take some time to watch all these crazy cars in front of the casino (parking space) !!!! Worth living out your inner James Bond after all!!!!!!",
          "Great service at the restaurant decent food kind of a tourist trap. The Casino has just a few slot machines. Everything is way over priced. Do yourself a favor, Park going wander around and leave. Go eat somewhere else.",

          "An old-money casino that does not disappoint though all semblance of exclusivity is gone. They now allow anybody to the lobby so its filled with screaming kids and people like at an amusement park. But, you can get an idea of the grandeur \u2026",
          "Feels so rich even only for one day \ud83d\ude06",
          "The aritecture and the art is stunning, and you can gamble and drink. Tip if your going to Monte Carlo don't go until the afternoon they seem to like a lie in.",
          "It was slow but also Wednesday, which was nice for us. The casino is beautiful on the inside. The cover was \u20ac17 but you got a \u20ac10 credit for play/bar/restaurant. Some people were not a dressed up as we had expected, which may be acceptable \u2026",
          "Beautiful spot in the exquisite Monte Carlo for some touristy pics. Lots of tourists, lots of fancy cars, and a casino that you probably cant afford to enter. The bouncers at the door will make sure of it.",

          "Overall the experience was a let down. The collection of digital slot machines made it feel like a cheap casino in Nevada, the drinks were comparable to an average bar, and the vibe was dead. It feels like it is in a moment of transition \u2026",

An unforgettable experience in grand style. Je reviens.",

          "Great and FANCY.  You have to pay 17\u20ac the entrance and you have 10\u20ac to play. In some cases you spend that in just 1 sec but in others you win money! Good luck",
          "If you are not a millionaire and cannot do Monaco things, it really is kinda boring, if there are exotic cars, they come out at dusk or at night, did not see one.  The front of the casino and of the bay is beautiful, but that's it.",

          "We had very high expectations and were not disappointed with the building - it is absolutely beautiful - majestic, elegant and very rich in details. The casino was a bit of a disappointment as it wasn't at all what we expected and actually quite small with mostly slot machines.",
          "Frankly - laughably poor service, very unprofessional staff and a focus on clientele who maybe are loose with their money but are not capable of personally recouping it without asking for a mother or father for a reimbursement. In short - go to Vegas for a real Casino",
          "A must do visit when in Monte-Carlo, an amazing building steeped in history and excitement. Very impressive both inside and out, the bar is very reasonably priced and you don\u2019t need to be a knowledgable gambler to enjoy the experience.",

          "We visited the casino earlier today, great atmosphere in and around the precinct, plenty of nice cars to look at, a little disappointing it costs to enter into the casino to drop a few coins, and your only allowed into the foyer for a look and a few photos, well worth a look",

          "Definitely a must visit when in Monaco but don\u2019t expect to have a typical gaming experience. Even on a Saturday the vibe was lacking and quite expensive given you have to pay to enter. You do get a credit towards a drink but it\u2019s still expensive. Atmosphere around the casino",

          "Monte Carlo is quite a different place to visit. You see wealth all around you. It is very clean and everything seems to lend itself to the wealthy. At the casino you can go into the lobby area to see the grand structure. However, if you want to gamble you have to pay to go into",
          "We were staying in Hotel de Paris and saved the visit for our last night. The problem is there is no way to get chips with anything other than local Mastercard and Visa. They no longer accept foreign cards, Amex or adding to your hotel bill (which they say is possible even",

          "Of course if you are in Monte-Carlo you have to go to the Casino, how can you not? Impressive from the outside, but with all the tourists it loses its grandeur. We were there early so bought a ticket to go in to the main part of the casino and wander around, you are able to sit",
          "One of the most classy and luxurious casinos which is part of the history of Monaco. A must go. There is live music and a bar",
          "Smaller than I expected but still impressive architecture inside and out. Outside of gambling just a small shop and a bar inside. Square outside nice with mirror to see the image of the building. To go inside the casino you need to have your passport and guys cannot wear shorts.",

          "Fantastic A must see / visit but make sure you read up prior as there are rules ! Dress appropriately as there are strict and enforced entry criteria along with a charge No shorts, sports clothing and or sandals / flip flops E17 entry fee payable along with photographic",
          "We really enjoyed the whole experience. The outside architecture was amazing and the interior design and decorative art was fantastic.",
          "If you are not interested in gambling and you just want to see the legendary casino, it is enough to look at it at the outside. It is a beautiful building from the inside as well but nothing really special.",
          "Well done. Not Vegas. Games, seats, rooms impressive. Smaller than we thought. Go early in morning no fees to get in",
          "For those who want a peak at this place, just walk up to the security at the front to be cleared to walk in. See the casino from the atrium inside the building....even if its for 10-15min. Its worth the short time spent....after all, what is MC without this iconic casino.",
          "I am not a person that's going to casinos. But for this I must say that for me the inside is very beautiful like a some museums or art gallery.",
          "The best Casino ever Very fancy and elegant You get the chance to feel like a star inside and lucky at the roulette",
          "When in Monaco, you have to visit the casino. Only got to the entrance area, it costs $$$ to go into the actual gaming areas (no pictures allowed, of course). It is a beautiful building but the lobby area was full of advertisement which took away from the buildings beauty.",
          "Visiting Monte Carlo was a long-time dream of mine. So many people told me that it wasn't worth the hype, that I would get disappointed and so on. I became really skeptical about it, however I decided to create my own experience and have my own opinion. When I first saw Monte",
          "It's beautiful. The cars parked out front are classic and expensive. It's a place you should put on your bucket list.",
          "Had to visit the casino when in Monte Carlo. We only went into the slot machine area which is free entrance although your wallet will be lighter on exit. We treated it as a bit of fun and didn\u2019t lose too much money. Beautiful building. Got to be done.",
          "It is very small but nice. It cost you 17 Euros to enter the main gaming floor and even more money for a private room. The bar is nice. Only one craps table in main casino. Won 40 euros in 20 minutes, short visit. They give you back 10 Euros in the form off 10 euros off a",
          "If you find yourself in MC you have to make a trip to the famous 007 casino and dress the part. The Martinis are fit for a king and the vibe is great. The design and decor is unbelievable and definitely an eye opener. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",
          "Nice looking from the outside but not impressive on the inside. A long list of watch you can't do/have in order to enter the casino.",
          "I know it's not its permanent state, but as of 28.04.2019 it's next to a large, noisy and dusty construction site. The view is not good at all. Cannot enjoy the cafe next to it at all. If you plan to visit, wait till they're done with construction.",
          "Absolutely beautiful interiors with highly decorated ceilings. There wasn\u2019t much atmosphere it it was 8pm so maybe it gets busier etc later. Dress code was also casual which I was surprised at.",
          "I'm not a great fan of casinos, but the building is beautiful inside and outside, the architecture is absolutely breathtaking. Has to be done when in Monaco, go and then you will see an extraordinary place.",
          "Nice building, but not worth to pay the price for the casino. 50 \u20ac was not enough for the croupier, so have to have a lot of money to play.",
          "Just had to visit the most famous casino in the world. Stunning from the outside and pure opulence from in side. Got in free to use slot machine. The tourists on both side of me won Euros 89 and 49 from 5 Euro bet. I played for five mins and only lost 25 cents. So not too",
          "Upon entry you are welcomed by the sheer grandeur of Monte Carlo. The foyer area is amazing and if you wish to enter the gambling area you need to buy a ticket for \u20ac17. A strange feeling when you have to pay to lose money, but that's Monte Carlo. There is an array of",
          "Admission to casino required paid ticked, one of the most famous Casino in the world, the atmosphere of extreme luxury, nice cars outside!!!",
          "Nice reception area, but you need to pay to visit the casino. Some nice cars parked outside. If your in the area stop by, but don't worry if you miss it.",
          "lovely grand entry to building. Admission to cassino required paid ticket. This was a disapointment.",
          "Great fun and relaxed for those who don\u2019t frequent casinos. Yes there is an air of opulence in writing a review of the most famous casino in the world and no I don\u2019t have a Ferrari - it doesn\u2019t matter. Must do.",
          "Do take the opportunity to make a morning visit when you get access to more rooms and can take photos. the coffees are also very good value for money",
          "Dropped in to pick up a \u20ac5 euro chip to add to my collection during a holiday to Nice/Monaco. A lovely place to visit and you can feel the wealth and history of the place. Costs \u20ac17 to get in but you get \u20ac10 of table game chips to use which are flagged at tourist chips so I",
          "You would be mad not to go in and have a look at the decor even if you didn\u2019t want a flutter. Grand, opulence wherever you look. It\u2019s free to go in and have a look but if you want to go into the Casino you have to pay 17 Euro\u2019s (I think) each and prepared to spend 20 Euro\u2019s on a",
          "If you are not a member, which I presume you aren\u2019t, this place is a complete waste of time. Stay outside and watch the Valet work the cool cars. That is the best part. As a common man and not part of the European aristocracy you will only have access to a very underwhelming",
          "As you do a visit to the Casino we thought was a must! Dressed to kill arrived, well what a let down...... grungy no atmosphere, staff so miserable, our excitement and expectations totally crushed. Would not visit again even though we did have a flutter on the roulette wheel and",
          "This is a gorgeous spot. I loved all the details in the entire facility. Everyone enojyed the visit.",
          "It is a beautiful building. It is a must see because it defines Monaco. They really don't want us tourists wandering around inside. We did go in, but they make seem a bit intimidating to just walk in. Two guys in suits at the door to stop you and search you with the wand.",
          "With the exception of the ceiling, the outside of the building I looks better than the inside. I appreciate its age, but looked slightly shabby. Great to see though and for a quick gamble",
          "Myself and my partner decided to go to the famous casino. Paid a small fee to gain entry but came out with over \u20ac2000 so was a great visit. Spacious with a lot of entertainment. Worth a visit if you have not been there.",
          "I loved looking around here. We went in just after it opened. Which was great. Nobody else there so we got to walk around. Ended up playing roulette for a bit and the staff were great, encouraging and got involved with us having fun. Which was great.",
          "Beautiful building and its location. Surrou ding atmoshphere is great. Casino is grand and interior is amazing. So lively.",
          "Here you can feel the atmosphere of extreme luxury ... An impression that accompanies us during our visit ... of course, you can not always win, but an evening at the Casino is a must.Ri\u00e8n ne va plus!",
          "This is a must see during a trip to Monaco. The grand casino and its history are the foundation of the wealth and glamour that is now modern day Monte Carlo.",
          "No interest in gambling but it was great to see this fine building. We walked around all 3 sides of it and marvelled at its splendour, along with the luxury cars around it and the magnificent hotel that looks so classy just across the road.",
          "Enjoy all of the luxury cars parked outside. There is an admission fee to enter the small but elegant casino. If you want to gamble, you can play on a few machines outside of the rooms that require admission fees.",
          "The square or if you want me to be correct, the circle is unique but the architectural design can be seen throughout Europe. The design of the lobby as well can be seen elsewhere. The casino machines are like any Casino \"toilet\". They just want you to flush away your money.",
          "Middle of February...Saturday evening...not busy, sort of boring. While the casino itself is very oppulent and beautifully antique, the clientelle was blah. I was under the impression there was a dress code but, while most of the women were nicely dressed, the men were coming",
          "Pretty much a disappointment for us. They have about 25 slot machines that you can access for free, otherwise you have to pay to get into where the tables are. You do receive a credit for it, but to be honest, it's a lot of hype and not much different than anywhere else in the",
          "One of the best places I have ever been. Not only do you have more supercars outside than you'll ever see, but going inside is legitimately incredible. 17 euros to get in but that does include 10 euros of chips. Min bet 5 euros on some tables - but bigger tables are 'unlimited'",
          "A beautiful place to visit if you are in town and like to gamble. Even if you don\u2019t, worry taking a few pics of this and the Paris hotel.",
          "My feeling was indescribable entering this historic establishment. Although many tourist around including my girlfriend and myself you can sense and touch the history these walls. We tried the roulette and blackjacks. Some luck was with us. An must when you are in Monte-Carlo.",
          "Had a walk around inside and out. You are allowed in the foyer of sorts for free in which is pretty but to go in the second part with the slots you have to drop your bags in the cloakroom and if you go to the tables the third room you pay 17 euros! We just wanted a look around",
          "When in Monte Carlo you really need to visit the world famous casino? An amazing building with great architecture. Hard to take photos due to the tyre of establishment. The gaming rooms are spacious and opulent. Not knowing the full ins and outs of the games, there were",
          "Stunning... the entry fee is almost subsidized with free drink or gaming credit. The atmosphere is amazing and reaks of history. Have a martini, shaken not stirred and live it up!",
          "It is very beautiful inside, make sure you have your passport with you and dressed well! My husband lost but I won! Very cool experience!",
          "If you're visiting Monte Carlo then your trip won't be complete unless you take the time to visit The Casino. Breathtaking surroundings, great for people watching and you can feel the history of the famous winners and losers that have passed through these legendary doors.",
          "We had to see this place. Rich & Famous all the way. My husband and our friends went in but I was not allowed past the 2nd room due to my stylish jeans were torn in one knee and I had orthopedic sandals on.. No torn jeans and No sandals allowed. No Problemo. I explored",
          "Fantastic building, great the watch the elite leave their cars for valet parking. Stunning interior, friendly staff and I even won (a modest amount albeit!)",
          "The Casino building is very beautiful. You can enter the lobby and the jackpot area, but to enter the main casino you should put some deposit. I just take a picture and enjoy the lobby. Outside the casino, there is restaurant and shops.",
          "You cannot be in Monte-Carlo and not visit this magnificent Casino. You feel it\u2019s history in the walls. Even if you don\u2019t play, it is worth a visit.",
          "This glitzy casino is a must visit in Monaco, even if you\u2019re not much of a gambler. If anything at all, it\u2019s a great spot for a selfie!",
          "Was here several years ago and came away seriously underwhelmed by the shabby roulette wheels and the overall dullness of the place. Brought friends here this year who had to check it off their list. Now there's a tacky display in the lobby and an endless conga line of tourists",
          "You have to see this place if in Monte Carlo but its not as big and grand as it seems in the movies. Inside is nice but seems dated. Its great for a few pictures on the outside but nothing much more than that.",
          "What a fun way to spend a few hours in fabulous Monaco!! It was my first time playing roulette and the croupier was extremely helpful!! Plus it's always fun to \"put on the ritz\" and wear a gown and jewels :-)",
          "You don't need to think of spending money when you talk about the casino of monte Carlo. You will certainly pay an entrance fee, around 20\u20ac (and don't forget to bring your passport or identity; so they allow you to enter.) BUT IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT. You can have a drink at the",
          "Casino Monte-Carlo is surely a cream-de-la-cream club. Built In a dashing old mansion, with royal drawings & statues all over the walls, and located in the center of Monte-Carlo dream town. Formal dress code is mandatory. Lots of cenima super stars visiting every night, And",
          "Interesting place. Can be funny even if you do not have enough money to bet. You can by delicious ice cream and take a lot pictures",
          "We was here in July when it's hot. Here you can see the opulence of the magnates through their cars in the car park, many tourists who admire their cars, many luxury shops around and so on. It's good to see how lives some peoples. Details of the palace and surroundings you can",
          "I had never visited a casino before and was never really a big fan of the idea. I was, however, intrigued during my visit to Monaco in April 2017 by the fact that this same casino had greatly contributed to the welfare of a Principality that is very close to my heart. Entering",
          "I didn't really go inside as I am not a fan of casinos anyway but I am amazed of how it looked like even just outside of it. The surrounding areas are also amazing. Maybe because it's Christmas time as well so there were lots of Christmas trees and decorations and it looked",
          "I understand that they don't want tourists to ruin the upscale snobbishness and environment of the privileged few but really charging 12 euros just to see the interior? No thanks, I'll take my business elsewhere. To pay you must be appropriately dressed and the fee is 17 euros.",
          "No gaming, just a vist to the stunning casino. Have to do it, just so you can say to yourself \" been there \" when you see it in a movie.",
          "To all those tourists thinking of visiting in November 2018 to January 2019, three words for you; do not bother. My husband and I visited last week with much anticipated excitement. We tipped the cloak room and bought our entry ticket, \u20ac17 each. Once we entered, we were",
          "The casino was quiet the evening my wife and I visited. The walk from the entrance to the table games area was surreal. Beautiful frescos and ornate carpentry/decoration was amazing! We also won some money and had a great time. Dealers were patient with a novice gambler and",
          "We paid a short visit to people watch and how others gamble without a care in the world. The Casino is very opulent and extravagant but watching punters drop thousands of euros worth of chips on the roulette table was a sight to behold. I was happy to have their special Bond",
          "Just like the movies including you need to dress up. Not too many in tuxes though. Nice place to gamble if you are into that and a pretty place. Very different then Las Vegas. Interestingly you need to bring your passports as citizens of Monaco are not allowed in.",
          "That\u2019s a very famous casino! If you visit it for cultural purposes only you will not see much. There\u2019s a construction fancies inside, the repair isn\u2019t finished yet. So, use 10\u20ac of the 17\u20ac entrance fee to play. I have seen how easy it to win and than to lose. You will also",
          "If You In Monaco you will come to this place. We are not gamblers. we entered and took a rest in casino bar/cafe. It is expensive place, but it is OK for one time visit and rest in nice atmosphere.",
          "We were on a tour to Monaco and after driving the whole Monte Carlo circuit we ended up with a photo op outside the Casino. The building was not as large in real life as I imagined it and visitors are not admitted until 14.00 I was informed by two burly bouncers. The gift shop",
          "Pop in before 1pm, for a browse, they charge you \u20ac17 , for an audio tour, and a sheet of paper, which is a map. Yes building and rooms are fabulous, but you don\u2019t get much for your money. Will only be in there 40 minutes browsing. You will get to see gambling rooms not being",
          "Did you know you can tour the casino before it opens? We took the tour and learned a lot about the history of the building and the people who frequent it. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "There are about 2 dozen or so slot machines to play near the entrance of the casino. To go any further, it costs 17 euros; some of this can be recovered on drinks or food. Unless you are a serious gambler with 500 euros plus to play the table games, especially roulette with",
          "Mone Carlo is surprisingly TINY I had no idea. The casino, is as expected tres stylish gorgeous architecture and furnishings. And of course luxury sport cars abound. Evening (I didn't go) but was advised tux and ball gowns so that would certainly add to the elegance look and",
          "Impressive facade backed up inside. As with any visitor to Monte Carlo we had to go through security to say we had done. Then some euros into the slot machines just to become yet another person who didn't break the bank in Monte Carlo",
          "One can see how this might be the place to see and be seen, but it is really quite small. The decor is definitely high end.",
          "It was closed for a private event, but we were still able to go in the lobby and see the grandeur of a beautiful place! Just the cars parked out front were worth the trip!",
          "There are only a couple of rooms and a couple of tables available to those that aren\u2019t high rollers. No table signs indicating minimums. The rooms to watch the VIPs are cordoned off. But, it\u2019s one of those bucket list items to say you\u2019ve been. You can do it in 15 minutes.",
          "We didn\u2019t play in the casino but just went inside. Lovely building and friendly staff who are happy for you to have a look.",
          "This Casino is steeped in history and a very different experience from most other Casinos. The building is beautiful inside and out, the road in front is lined with Supercars and the overall feel is classic. There is a \u20ac10 entry fee and copies of ID are taken. Formal or smart",
          "Can not understand what all the fuss is about. Stunning building, some impressive cars parked outside the front. Inside, couldn\u2019t believe it!!!! Lots of suits, giving an impression of it being busy, but it was not at all busy for a Friday night. 4 Poker tables, 3 roulette",
          "The building is nice. But the casino, on a weekday night, at about 9:00 PM, was depressingly empty. There were about 30 people on the main floor. About 4 real gamblers, and 26 spectators. We used our 10 euro credit (from the 17 euro entrance fee) to buy (overpriced) drinks.",
          "You can enter the Casino during the day and for a fee you can go inside the actual gaming areas. If you prefer not to you can buy items from the cashiers or have a drink from the bar in the lobby.",

          "Having been in many casinos around the world this is the only one where you have to pay \u20ac17 euro entry fee for the pleasure of having your pants pulled down once your in there, ridiculous to charge to go somewhere and lose money ha.. the building is magnificent and grand, but",
          "We made a fairly quick stop at the Monte-Carlo Casino as part of a cruise excursion. The biggest thing is to know when the casino is open (beyond the lobby) and what to wear. When we were there is was after 2 pm and you must have pants. We saw the exterior and the lobby,",
          "I was struck by how small the main floor was. Just a couple of tables (roulette with 5 EUR min and Blackjack tables with 25 EUR buy in and max of 1250EUR). Lots of ladies sitting in the wings watching so, noting the dress code, match your clothes and gambling to the level of",
          "I don\u2019t gamble but have been wanting to see this building forever. We arrived after a drive from Cannes not overly dressed up mid afternoon. An absolutely gorgeous building in a spectacular location. Great parking next door too. After initial intimidation to enter .. I asked",
          "You need to see the fabulous decor of the rooms inside the casino. Yes, the outside of the building is lovely, but the inside is spectacular. The paintings, stained glass windows, the architecture, etc of each room is different. And, each different room is magnificent.",
          "Absolutely amazing place to visit,is grandiose ,great place to visit ,but the prices,omg...so pricey...we pay for a small coffee 20 euros...and because i was very surprised by the price the waiter come to me and full me a whole boll with peanuts,as a compensation...i will never",
          "The architecture of this building is absolutely breathtaking, outside and in, and it's worth visiting for that, even if there weren't all the film connections. It is quite an expensive day visit, but I didn't regret the spend - you just need to use a bit of imagination to",
          "It\u2019s the symbol of Monaco\u2019s economic resurrection, and the opulence that followed. From it\u2019s grandeur and romantic image on its gambling tables, it has however stooped down to include the noisy common place slot machines (what a disappointment!)",
          "The building is iconic and quite magnificent, they had a really good piano player/singer and the atmosphere is fairly relaxed. Some guests really did make an effort with their outfits, others didn\u2019t, a few cases I was surprised went through the door. 25 euros min bet at the",
          "It was just like the movies. It was great to be able to enter such a famous building that has been in many movies. It really is grand and worth a visit.",
          "We visited the casino of Monte Carlo which was amazing and definitely shows how the other half live. The building is beautiful and the pathway leading up to the entrance is lined with designer shops such as Channel. The cars parked at the front of the building includes",
          "Stopped in Monaco and Monte Carlo as part of a cruise itinerary. Opulence, glitz and glamour and something to be experienced at least once. Went into the Casino to have a look but decided to be a little extravagant and have a beer in the lounge. Was rather expensive for a",
          "Worth a visit if you are in the area as it has such a glamorous reputation, but you may be disappointed",
          "Worth a visit if your in the area. There are security guards outside the building checking bags and scanning you. Once your in there is a little casino which you can use the slots the bar is nice for a little relax too. To use the main casino you have to follow the dress code.",
          "All the hype...cost \u20ac17 euro just to get in and it is a small room with handful of machines and maybe three tables. Fortunately we had a complimentary entry from our hotel but honestly spend your money some place else.",
          "We took an evening tour to the casino. We did need our passports to get in. There is also an evening dress code. It was 17 euros to get in. But you also get a 10 euro credit to use towards different things. No photos are allowed once you are inside the casino. We were there in a",
          "..it does not get more clasic than this. Absolutely lovely interior and you could more or less feel the smell of money when you are visiting. No jackpots unfortunately.",
          "I guess both monaco and monte carlo didnt meet expectations for me. Im glad we spent a day there, but i probably wouldnt revist. Monaco really is a city you need alot of money to fully enjoy. We are both gamblers & visit vegas often. The casino wasnt as large or as grand as i",
          "We were able to get in for $17 euro each. One we got in we found it beautiful inside. That being said, it had very few people at 9 at night. Maybe 25 people. No music. No pictures allowed. Save your money, not like the movie at all.",
          "Went in for a nosey and a loo stop. Well its the poshest loo stop ever. Bag checked by security on the way in, but fair play as there was a TV/movie event in Monte Carlo at the time. We just walked round, seen the gambling room but didn't go in it. Lot's of other people just in",
          "Its all very extravagant and a nice little look at how the other half live. If you are in the area you should definitely go. You can go into the first lobby area without paying anything however to get onto the casino floor I think its about 70 euro each.",
          "What a beautiful building. Our tour guide wanted to take us to see the rear entrance, as well as the front, as it was something special to see, however, there was an event being prepared for so we couldn\u2019t get too close. We did have a guided tour inside the casino. You can just",
          "Had always wanted to visit this casino and have a little flutter on the roulette wheel. You have to pay 17euro,s but you get 10 back to either spend at tables or at bar. O. H put 5 euro on his birth date and won 175.euro so was well happy. Lovely building well worth a visit just",
          "It is a small but elegant casino with all of the trappings of the money it brings to the country. Once in a lifetime stop to see, and remember there is a strict dress code if you want to enter the gambling area for an additional \u20ac17 pp fee. Beautiful frescos and artwork, as",
          "First time in Monaco. Together with my partner we visited the place on Friday night. It\u2019s one of those \u201cmust see\u201d. Beautiful deco inside, the building itself it\u2019s very interesting. On the weekends there is live music being played. We had a pleasure of meeting the gentleman",
          "This was a 50th birthday trip with seven other friends and although I've been once before, it was amazing. This is a stunning building and we enjoyed cocktails in the bar, taking photos (which you couldn't do when I went years ago) and generally taking in the ambience. I would",
          "After a hike to get up to the casino and the hefty \u20ac17 to get in we were super disappointed, the casino was tiny and very empty. Monaco itself is a stunning city, our day of exploring was great and we thought we would finish it off at the famous Casino expecting something",
          "Although formal wear is required for evening gambling (and there is a very high entry fee of $35 EU just to gamble), the casino is open in the morning for a free quick peek (no need to dress up) or a more in-depth tour which costs $17 EU (there are reduced prices if enough",
          "We had been to Vegas few times and this was quite different. The building is very interesting but the main salon was quite small. We went around 4PM so the place was relatively quiet. They have many private rooms for high rollers that didn't allow observers. James Bond was not",
          "A friend and I were en route to Italy, but stopped in Monte Carlo just to see the casino. What a waste of time and energy. Maybe Vegas has spoiled me?",

          "I really think every guy at some point in their life envisions themselves as James Bond in coming to this casino in walking in and having it be lavish and beautiful and lots of experienced players playing cards and what it is is a complete tourist trap to rip you off out of",

          "The only thing missing from my own imagination was Bridgette Bardo at my side for good luck. The entry fee I didn't like, after all I am James Bond, but it probably kept the rift raft outside like MoneyPenny. Ornate and royal its majestic architecture is not duplicated anywhere",

          "I\u2019ve been to Monaco once before but this place still makes me smile. It\u2019s basically what you\u2019d expect out of a James Bond movie. \u20ac12 entry is a bit cheeky but assumedly keeps it from being over run. Was hoping to get into the lounge area but was told even with a jacket it\u2019s",

          "Its one of a kind Casino, very luxury and the ambiance is just mind blowing, Its in the heart of the town and surrounded by many luxury hotels and If you wish to just visit this place you need to purchase a ticket of 10-20 Euros per person.",
          "This Casio is probably one of the most recognized casino around the world. Not a big deal to enter. Stay on the line , pass through the security check and play what ever you prefer. The staffs were very welcoming and answered some of my queries. The atmosphere is very different",
          "I am not a true gambler but like to visit casino. It starts from 1400 hrs. Good location but little bit in hilly area. Exterior of the building is beautiful. Good architecture. There was tight security while entering the casino.",

          "I last visited the Casino back in '79 and the doorman loaned me a coat to enter under the dress rules of the day, a wonderful experience, plus I won a few Francs !! I took my wife & daughter to show them and recapture the feeling but alas, No ! Next to anyone can now enter as",
          "Four of us, smartly dressed, went in at 10pm midweek. Great looking building with flash cars out front. 12euros each to enter, what a waste of time. Lovely building inside as well but we were contained in the small front area with only one roulette table open with about 6 people"

Of note are the retable (circa 1500) to the right of the transept, the Great Altar and the Episcopal throne in white Carrara marble.\nPontifical services take place on the major religious festivals, such as the Feast of Sainte D\u00e9vote (27 January) and the national holiday (19 November). On feast days and during religious music concerts, one can hear the magnificent four-keyboard organ, inaugurated in 1976.\nFrom September through June, \u201cLes Petits Chanteurs de Monaco\u201d and the singers of the Cathedral Choir School sing during Mass every Sunday at 10:00am. Mass is also celebrated here each year on 6 December, when primary children gather for a joyful remembrance of St. Nicholas' life.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCategory:Burials at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate, Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the official residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and besieged by many foreign powers. Since the end of the 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family who first captured it in 1297. The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with their larger and stronger neighbours.\nThus while other European sovereigns were building luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics and common sense demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco one of the most unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.\nThe Grimaldis' occupation of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, the absence of alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted in their use of the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected in the evolution of the palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became symbols of the slightly risqu\u00e9 glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became a chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.\n\n\n== Princely Palace ==\n\nThe palace is a blend of architectural styles; its ancient origins are indicated by a lack of symmetry. Thus to evaluate the architecture, wings and blocks have to be observed separately. The principal fa\u00e7ade appears as a terrace of Renaissance style palazzi from differing periods of the Renaissance era (Illustrations 1 and 12) which\u2014even though they form only one palace\u2014is exactly what they are. These wings are however united by their common rusticated ground floor. This Renaissance architecture seems to mask earlier fortifications, the towers of which rise behind the differing classical fa\u00e7ades. These towers\u2014many complete with crenellations and machicolations\u2014were actually mostly rebuilt during the 19th century. At the rear of the palace the original medieval fortifications seem untouched by time. (Illustration 4). A greater architectural harmony has been achieved within the court of honour around which the palace is built, where two tiers of frescoed open arcades serve as both a ceremonial balcony for the prince's appearances and a state entrance and corridor linking the formal state rooms of the palace.\n\nThe most notable of the many rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were enhanced in the style of those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.Other rooms in the state suite include the Red Room \u2014 so called because its walls are covered in red brocade \u2014 a large drawing room containing paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.\nThe most remarkable room in the suite is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room is lined with Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.\nWhile the overriding atmosphere of the interior and exterior of the palace is of the 18th century, the palace itself is not. Much of its appearance is a result of a long evolution dating from the 12th century, overshadowed by heavy restoration and refurnishing during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\n== Grimaldi fortress ==\n\nMonaco's history predates the Roman occupation of AD 122. Its large natural harbour ensured a steady stream of visitors from Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon. Later the Phoenicians came to trade silk, oil, and spices with the natives. It was the Phoenicians who introduced to this area of the Mediterranean their god Melkart, later known by the Romans as Hercules Monoikos. It was after this god that the Romans renamed the area Portus Hercules Moneici, which has evolved to the present name of Monaco.\nThe seat of the Prince of Monaco was established on the Rocher de Monaco (Illustration 5) as a fortress in 1191 when the harbour, that is today lined by Monte Carlo, was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. The harbour and its immediate area were given to the Genoese by the Emperor Henry IV with the proviso that the Genoese protect the coastline from piracy. Further territory was ceded to the new owners by the Council of Peille and the Abbaye de Saint Pons. In 1215 work began on a new fortress, comprising four towers connected by ramparts protected by a curtain wall. This forms the core of the present palace.\nGenoa was important in the politics of 12th-century Europe. The Genoese were a nation of merchants, and such was their wealth that they frequently fulfilled a role as bankers to the other nation states. However, the Genoese became divided following the rift caused when the Emperor Frederick II challenged the power of Pope Innocent IV. Two distinct camps formed: the Guelphs who supported the pope and the Ghibellines who were loyal to the imperial crown. Siding with the Guelphs were one of the patrician families of Genoa\u2014the Grimaldi. Throughout the 13th century these two groups fought. Finally at the end of the century the Ghibellines were victorious and banished their opponents, including the Grimaldi, from Genoa. The Grimaldi settled in the area today known as the French Riviera. Several castles in the area are still known as Chateau Grimaldi, and testify to the strong presence of various branches of the family in the vicinity.\n\nLegend relates that in January 1297 Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi, disguised as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. This event is commemorated by a statue of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (Illustration 6) and in the arms of the House of Grimaldi where Fran\u00e7ois is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (Illustration 2).\nCharles I, who ruled from 1331 to 1357, and was the son of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, significantly enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently, they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.\nFor the next hundred years the Grimaldi defended their territory from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence. The fortress was frequently bombarded, damaged, and restored. Gradually the Grimaldi began to make an alliance with France which strengthened their position. Now more secure, the Grimaldi lords of Monaco now began to recognise the need not only to defend their territory, but also to have a home reflecting their power and prestige.\nThroughout the 15th century, both the fortress and the Rocher continued to be extended and further defended until it became a garrison accommodating some 400 troops. The slow transformation from fortified house to palace (Illustration 7) began during this era, first with building by Lamberto Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco (who between 1458 and 1494 was \"a noteworthy ruler who handled diplomacy and the sword with equal talent\"), and then by his son Jean II. This period saw the extension of the east side of the fortress with a three\u2013floored wing, guarded by high scalloped walls connecting the bastion towers\u2014St Mary (M in Illustration 7), Middle (K) and South (H). This large new wing contained the palace's principal room, the State Hall (today known as the Guard Room). Here the princes carried out their official business and held court. Further, more luxurious, rooms complete with balconies and loggias were designed for the private use of the Grimaldi family. In 1505 Jean II was killed by his brother Lucien.\n\n\n== Fortress to palace ==\n\n\n=== Lucien I (1505\u20131523) ===\n\nJean II was succeeded by his brother Lucien I. Peace did not reign in Monaco for long; in December 1506 14,000 Genoese troops besieged Monaco and its castle, and for five months 1,500 Mon\u00e9gasques and mercenaries defended the Rocher before achieving victory in March 1507. This left Lucien I to walk a diplomatic tightrope between France and Spain in order to preserve the fragile independence of the tiny state which was in truth subject to Spain. Lucien immediately set about repairing the ravages of war to the fortified palace which had been damaged by heavy bombardment. To the main wing (see Illustrations 3 & 7 \u2013 H to M ), built by Prince Lambert and extended during the reign of Jean II, he now added a large wing (H to C) which today houses the state apartments.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 I (1523\u20131581) ===\nDuring the reign of Honor\u00e9 I the internal transformation from fortress to palace was continued. The Treaty of Trodesillas at the beginning of Honor\u00e9's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This provided the security to allow the Lord of Monaco to concentrate on the more comfortable side of his residence rather than the constant need to defend it.\nThe courtyard was rebuilt, the architect Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading on the upper level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honor\u00e9 II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On the other side of the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.Further enlargements were carried out in order to entertain the Emperor Charles V in 1529, when he stayed four nights at the palace during his journey in state to Bologna for his coronation by Pope Clement VII.\n\nArchitecturally this was an exciting period, but Honor\u00e9 I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honor\u00e9's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded the end of the rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 II (1597\u20131662) ===\n\nMonaco's vulnerability was further brought home in 1605 when the Spanish installed a garrison there. In 1633 Honor\u00e9 II (Illustration 8), was officially addressed as \"Serene Prince\" by the Spanish king, thus recognizing Monaco as a principality for the first time. However, as Spanish troops were currently in occupation, this recognition was seen as little more than a gesture to keep Honor\u00e9 happy.Honor\u00e9 II was a francophile. Following his education in Milan, he had been cultivated by the intellectual salons of Paris. Thus, having close affinities with France both culturally and politically, he rebelled against the Spanish presence in Monaco. While he realised that Monaco needed the protection of another power, France was Honor\u00e9 II's favoured choice. In 1641, heavily supported by the French, he attacked the Spanish garrison and expelled the Spanish, declaring \"the glorious liberty of Monaco\". The liberty mentioned was entirely dependent on France, as Monaco now entered a period as a protectorate of France which would last until 1814. As a result of this action Honor\u00e9 II is today regarded as the hero of Monaco.Highly educated and a patron of the arts, Honor\u00e9 II, secure on his throne, began collecting works by Titian, D\u00fcrer, Raphael, Rubens and Michelangelo which formed the basis of the art collection that furnished the palace slowly evolving from the Monaco fortress. Over the following 30-year period he transformed it into a palace suitable for a prince (Illustration 9).\nHe commissioned the architect Jacques Catone not only to enlarge the palace, but also to soften its grim fortified appearance. The main fa\u00e7ade facing the square, the \"front\" of the palace, was given decorative embellishments. The upper loggias (B) to the right of the entrance were glazed. Inside the palace the State Rooms Wing was restyled and the enfilade of state apartments created. A new chapel adorned by a cupola (built on the site marked D) was dedicated to St John the Baptist. This new work helped conceal the forbidding Serravalle Bastion from the courtyard, to create the lighter atmosphere of a Renaissance palazzo.\n\n\n== Absentee landlords and revolution (1662\u20131815) ==\n\nDuring the late 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an independent state, it was in reality a province of France. Its rulers spent much of their time at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure of Versailles was greater than that of their own country.\nHonor\u00e9 II was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Louis I. The new prince had an urbane personality and spent much time with his wife at the French court, where he enjoyed the unusual distinction of being both a foreign head of state and a peer of France. Impressed by the palaces of the French king, who had employed the architect Jean du Cerceau to carry out alterations to the palace at Fontainebleau, Louis I used Fontainebleau as the inspiration for enhancements to his palace at Monaco. Thus he was responsible for two of the palace's most notable features: the entrance\u2014a huge Baroque arch surmounted by a broken pediment bearing the Grimaldi Arms (Illustration 10)\u2014and more memorable still, a double horseshoe staircase modelled on that at Fontainebleau. The thirty steps which compose the staircase are said to have been sculpted from a single block of Carrara marble.  Both the architrave of the new entrance and the horseshoe stairs were designed by Antoine Grigho, an architect from Como.A prince noted for the permissiveness of his private life, Louis I's prodigality was notorious. While visiting England in 1677 he incurred the ire of King Charles II by showering expensive gifts on Hortense Mancini, the king's mistress. The English and Prince Louis later became political enemies when Louis took part in the Anglo-Dutch Wars against England, leading his own Monaco Cavalry into battles in Flanders and Franche-Comt\u00e9. These acts earned Louis the gratitude of Louis XIV who made him ambassador to the Holy See, charged with securing the Spanish Succession. However, the cost of upholding his position at the papal court caused him to sell most of his grandfather Honor\u00e9 II's art collection, denuding the palace he had earlier so spectacularly enhanced. Louis died before securing the Spanish throne for France, an act which would have earned the Grimaldi huge rewards. Instead Europe was immediately plunged into turmoil as the War of the Spanish Succession began.\n\nIn 1701, Prince Antoine succeeded Louis I and inherited an almost bankrupt Monaco, though he did further embellish the Royal Room. On its ceiling, Gregorio de Ferrari and Alexandre Haffner depicted a figure of Fame surrounded by lunettes illustrating the four seasons.\nAntoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Mon\u00e9gasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honor\u00e9 III.Honor\u00e9 III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honor\u00e9 III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798.\nThe Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honor\u00e9 III's son and heir, the future Honor\u00e9 IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be governed by others, most notably a former tutor. It was on one of Honor\u00e9 III's rare visits to the palace in 1767 that illness forced Edward, Duke of York, to land at Monaco. The sick duke was allocated the state bedchamber where he promptly died. Since that date the room has been known as the York Room.\nDespite its lack of continuous occupancy, by the final quarter of the 18th century the palace was once again a \"splendid place\" (Illustration 12). However revolution was afoot, and in the late 1780s Honor\u00e9 III had to make concessions to his people who had caught the revolutionary ideas from their French neighbours. This was only the beginning of the Grimaldi's problems. In 1793 the leaders of the French Revolution annexed Monaco. The prince was imprisoned in France and his property and estates, including the palace, were forfeited to France.\nThe palace was looted by the prince's subjects, and what remained of the furnishings and art collection was auctioned by the French government. Further changes were heaped on both the country and palace. Monaco was renamed Fort d'Hercule and became a canton of France while the palace became a military hospital and poorhouse. In Paris, the prince's daughter-in-law Francoise-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul-Stainville (1766\u20131794) was executed, one of the last to be guillotined during the Reign of Terror.  Honor\u00e9 III died in 1795 in Paris, where he had spent most of his life, without regaining his throne.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Regaining the palace ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was succeeded by his son Honor\u00e9 IV (1758\u20131819) whose marriage to Louise d'Aumont Mazarin had done so much to restore the Grimaldi fortunes. Much of this fortune had been depleted by the hardships of the revolution. On 17 June 1814 under the Treaty of Paris, the Principality of Monaco was restored to Honor\u00e9 IV.\nThe fabric of the palace had been completely neglected during the years in which the Grimaldi had been exiled from Monaco. Such was the state of disrepair that part of the east wing had to be demolished along with Honor\u00e9 II's bathing pavilion, which stood on the site occupied today by the palace's former Napoleon Museum, which closed in 2014, and the building housing the palace archives.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV died shortly after his throne was restored to him, and structural restoration of the palace began under Honor\u00e9 V and was continued after his death in 1841 by his brother Prince Florestan. However, by the time of Florestan's accession, Monaco was once again experiencing political tensions caused by financial problems. These resulted from its position as a protectorate of Sardinia, the country to which it had been ceded by France following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Florestan, an eccentric (he had been a professional actor), left the running of Monaco to his wife, Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. Despite her attempts to rule, her husband's people were once again in revolt. In an attempt to ease the volatile situation Florestan ceded power to his son Charles, but this came too late to appease the Mon\u00e9gasques. Menton and Roquebrune broke away from Monaco, leaving the Grimaldi's already small country hugely diminished\u2014little more than Monte Carlo.\n\nFlorestan died in 1856 and his son, Charles, who had already been ruling what remained of Monaco, succeeded him as Charles III (Illustration 15). Menton and Roquebrune officially became part of France in 1861, reducing Monaco's size at a stroke by 80%. With time on his hands, Charles III now devoted his time to completing the restoration of his palace begun by his uncle Honor\u00e9 V. He rebuilt St Mary's Tower (Illustration 14) and completely restored the chapel, adding a new altar, and having its vaulted ceiling painted with frescoes, while outside the fa\u00e7ade was painted by Jacob Fro\u00ebschle and Deschler with murals illustrating various heroic deeds performed by the Grimaldi. The Guard Room, the former great hall of the fortress (now known as the State Hall), was transformed by new Renaissance decorations and the addition of a monumental chimneypiece.\nCharles III also made serious attempts to find the various works of art and furniture looted, sold and dispersed during the revolution. Together with new purchases, a fine art collection once again adorned the palace which included not only family portraits such as that of Lucien I by de Predis; Honor\u00e9 II by Philippe de Champaigne; the head of Antoine I by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and van Loo's portrait of Louise-Hyppolyte (Illustration 11) but also such masterpieces as The Music Lesson by Titian.\nCharles III was also responsible for another palace in Monte Carlo, one which would fund his restorations, and turn around his country's faltering economy. This new palace was Charles Garnier's Second Empire casino, completed in 1878 (Illustration 16). The first Monaco casino had opened the previous decade. Through the casino Monaco became self-supporting.\n\n\n=== Decline of Grimaldi power ===\nBy the time of Charles III's death in 1889, Monaco and Monte Carlo were synonymous as one and the same place, and had acquired, through gambling, a reputation as a louche and decadent playground of the rich. It attracted everyone from Russian grand dukes and railway magnates, often with their mistresses, to adventurers, causing the small country to be derided by many including Queen Victoria. In fact so decadent was Monaco considered that from 1882, when she first began visiting the French Riviera, Queen Victoria refused to make a courtesy social call at the palace. The contemporary writer Sabine Baring-Gould described the habitu\u00e9es of Monaco as \"the moral cesspool of Europe.\"\n\nThe successive rulers of Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, a daughter of Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry into the family she contemplated turning the casino into a convalescent home for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice was able to put her plan into action.\nIn 1910, the palace was stormed during the Monegasque Revolution. The prince pronounced an end to absolute monarchy by promulgating a constitution with an elected parliament the following year.\nAlbert was succeeded in 1922 by his son Louis II. Louis II had been brought up by his mother and stepfather, Prince Taszil\u00f3 Festetics de Tolna, in Germany, and did not know Monaco at all until he was 11. He had a distant relationship with his father and served in the French Army. While posted abroad, he met his mistress Marie Juliette Louvet, by whom he had a daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born in Algeria in 1898. As Prince of Monaco, Louis II spent much time elsewhere, preferring to live on the family estate of Le Marchais close to Paris. In 1911 Prince Louis had a law passed legitimising his daughter so that she could inherit the throne, in order to prevent its passing to a distant German branch of the family. The law was challenged and developed into what became known as Monaco succession crisis. Finally in 1919 the prince formally adopted his illegitimate daughter Charlotte, who became known as Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. Louis II's collection of artefacts belonging to Napoleon I form the foundation of the Napoleon Museum at the palace, which is open to the public.\nDuring World War II, Louis attempted to keep Monaco neutral, although his sympathies were with the Vichy French Government.  This caused a rift with his grandson Rainier, his daughter's son, and the heir to Louis's throne, who strongly supported the Allies against the Nazis.\nFollowing the liberation of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis did little for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946 he was spending most of his time in Paris, and on 27 July of that year, he married for the first time. Absent from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived on their estate in France. Prince Louis died in 1949 and was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Rainier III.\n\n\n== Rainier III ==\n\nPrince Rainier III was responsible for not only turning around the fortune and reputation of Monaco but also for overseeing the restoration of the palace. Upon his accession in 1949 Prince Rainier III immediately began a program of renovation and restoration. Many of the external frescoes on the courtyard were restored, while the southern wing, destroyed following the French revolution, was rebuilt. This is the part of the palace where the ruling family have their private apartments. The wing also houses the Napoleon Museum and the archives.\nThe frescoes decorating the open arcade known as the Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who imported works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of the rooms were refurnished and redecorated. Many of the marble floors have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with intarsia designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.Together with his wife, the late Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier not only restored the palace, but from the 1970s also made it the headquarters of a large and thriving business, which encouraged light industry to Monaco, the aim of which was to lessen Monaco's dependence on the income from gambling. This involved land reclamation, the development of new beaches, and high rise luxury housing. As a result of Monaco's increase in prestige, in 1993 it joined the United Nations, with Rainier's heir Prince Albert as head of the Monaco delegation.Princess Grace predeceased her husband, dying in 1982 as the result of a car accident. When Rainier III died in 2005 he left both his palace and his country in a stronger and more stable state of repair financially and structurally than they had been for centuries.\n\n\n== The palace in the 21st century ==\nToday the palace is home to Prince Rainier's son and successor, Prince Albert II. The state rooms are open to the public during the summer, and since 1960, the palace's courtyard has been the setting for open-air concerts given by Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra (formerly known as the Orchestra of the National Opera).However, the palace is far more than a tourist attraction and museum: it remains a fully working palace and headquarters of the Mon\u00e9gasque ruler, a fact emphasised by the sentries on constant guard duty at the entrance (Illustration 17). The sovereign princes, although bound by constitution, are involved with the day-to-day running of Monaco as both a country and a business. Today Monaco covers an area of 197 hectares (487 acres) of which 40 hectares (99 acres) have been reclaimed from the sea since 1980.For important Mon\u00e9gasque events\u2014such as Grimaldi weddings and births\u2014the palace courtyard is opened and the assembled citizens of Monaco are addressed by the prince from the Gallery of Hercules overlooking the courtyard.  The courtyard is also used to host the annual children's Christmas party. Through such events, the palace continues to play a central role in the lives of the prince and his subjects, as it has done for over 700 years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Monaco\nList of rulers of Monaco\nHistory of Monaco\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We watched the changing of the guards. Very simple. We walked through the palace. We were short on time so we only spent about 15 minutes walking through,",
          "A must-see when in Monaco, the Prince\u2019s Palace is very elegant and the part open to visitors doesn\u2019t take very long to get through even with an audio-guide. A whole section is devoted to Grace Kelly who and her famous meeting with Prince Rainier, but there is also a lot of",

          "We did not go into the Palace and sadly, missed the changing of the guard. We did, however, have a good time wandering the area, going into shops and restaurants etc. Short walk to the church where Princess Grace is entombed. Very beautiful area and while we did not do anything",
          "We visited Monaco on a warm day so we took the bus to the palace. It is \u20ac2 per person. Once you get to the top you can walk the narrow streets that lead to the palace and also enjoy the magnificent view of Monaco. You can buy ticket for the tour in the gift shop (\u20ac4-\u20ac8 per",

          "It\u2019s worth to climb the stairs just to see the overview of the city. There are some small restaurants and gift shops in the vicinity of the Palace but. would not recommend them. Crowds of tourist attended to be expected. Still, it is worth it.",
          "This wasn\u2019t originally on our must do list but we\u2019re glad we visited. The palace is still in use so there will be times it\u2019s closed if the family is in residence. The tour (with audio guide) recreates the first meeting of Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly while also outlining",
          "We walked from casino square all the way up to the palace. It was hot and a little up hill, but it was so worth it. 11am is the changing of the guard, so it does get pretty busy with tourists. Lots of nice shops to browse around. The prices do vary by a few euros if you move",
          "Quite amazing view from the hill towarss harbor. The palace simple, but very beautiful, clean. Worth seeing. Next stop could be Prince collection of antique cars...",
          "Great feeling! It is a great place to be. As we hear the story about Princess Grace Kelly and the videos she recorded inside the castle gives us as the feeling she is is still there. The place is wonderful! It's marvelous experience and I recommend it to anyone.",
          "Magnificent palace both outside and inside. The theme was mostly about Grace Kelly. I was disappointed that I could not take any photos inside. There is a souvenir shop outside the palace. I got a few small souvenirs to remember my visit. They have a ticket offers there, with",
          "Crossed off another bucket list visit. However, saddened that I could not video or take home any pictures from my camera. Thankfully though there was a gift/souvenir shop right outside and I was able to purchase a nice book for 12 euro that featured many of the rooms and",
          "An entrance fee of 8 Euros is required but doubt if it was worth it. Spending time outside and free is much better. If possible see the changing of the guard. The Hop-on Hop-off bus stops here. Great to soak up the atmosphere and the view over the harbour is magnificent.",

          "Although there look to be other options (Hop On/Off bus and a mini \"train\"), we took the option of scaling the \"Rock\" on foot on a hot day - good exercise !! We got there just in time for the changing of the guard, visited the Aquarium and walked through the gardens.If you wish",
          "Apparently it is a must-see for tourists. I think this is mainly down to its history rather than its lavish exterior. I have to say that first of all I didn't go inside and neither did I see the changing of the guard which is only at noon each day (the hottest time of the day",
          "When we did a tour of Monte Carlo and Monaco, we got to see the Palace! The walk up to the Palace will take you about 10 - 15 mins. You will pass by the Aquarium, Princess Caroline's home, and the Cathedral where Grace Kelly got married. Our tour guide timed it so we got to",
          "The guards here are not like Buckingham Palace but are still very cool. They aren't as serious and are strolling more than marching but it is fun to watch. Check out the overlook and the cannons. Stacked cannonballs for great picture taking with the kids. Watch for the",
          "Very nice place where Grimaldi set up the palace to have the most beautiful view of its bay. You maybe meet some important persons while nyou are walking around. Nice to si the palace at day and also at night.",
          "The Palace state rooms are open to visitors a limited time period each year. Visiting the non living quarters of the Princes Palace is visiting a royal art and antiquities museum. An audio guide is included with your visit. No flash photos. Hope this helps.",
          "Monaco is basically about money - it is a refuge for very rich people. But there is a historical side to Monaco as exemplified by the private apartments of the Prince's Palace. The decor is sumptuous with lots of velvet and gold leaf. The style of the private apartments is",
          "Took time queing (even a short q) to buy tickets, but once inside, a very well presented palace, just a few rooms on show, Grace Kelly very prominent added to the interest.",
          "We took the palace tour and it was excellent as it was self guided but with audio descriptions and time to look around yourself as well. A very well organised tour to be able to get an idea of the history, both past and current, of a very interesting and unique principality.",
          "Whenever in Monaco don't miss it the views around overlooking Monaco are wonderful , entering to the palace is also nice if you like to see some history about this family.",
          "We only visited the outside of the palace since we wanted to see the Cathedral and Casino, but only had one day to do it all. The views are spectacular on both sides and the changing of the guard at noon is quite cool. There are lots of cannons and cannon balls around the front",
          "Great story of the property and its occupants from a historical perspective. Saw the noon changing of the guard which did not disappoint. Amazing views of Monte Carlo are only a few steps away!",
          "Enjoyed the story, especially through the Grace Kelly era, but fantastic history lesson as well. I learned a lot about Monaco. The construction and detailing of the palace is of particular interest to me, particularly the mosaics in the marble floors, and the furniture cabinetry",
          "This is a great tour, in a beautiful location and interesting history. Try to see the changing of the guards.",
          "We reached here in time for the change of guard ceremony at 11.55 am. The palace and its surrounds invariably have you clicking.",
          "I had mixed impressions about Monaco: overbuilt and crowded but is has a really beautiful and well preserved old town and the Place du Palais is lovely.",
          "Markup of the old town, everything happening around the palace. It has only small part of old time, everything else is restored and looks brand new like anything else in Monaco",
          "Nice quick look at the Palace. The changing of the guard was good as well. Audio is easy to use. Staff friendly. Hop on/off right there. Great photo as well.",
          "It is a bit of a climb to get to the top but the views are amazing, very central too so if your only there for a few hours like we were but wanted a good viewpoint then I would recommend. There are quite a few little shops and restaurants (which were very reasonably priced) at",
          "Nice view we can see all cities on both side and lovely walking g around it should few hour in there",
          "Nothing wrong with the palace in itself but the staff at the tourism office that sells the tickets were among the rudest and most unaccommodating I have ever encountered. We bought a ticket to visit both the palace and the aquarium. After visiting the palace and having lunch we",
          "Having been to Monaco many times, I had never been here. The climb was a little arduous when you are not fit but well worth the effort. The overall experience is one of attention to detail, cleanliness and professionally run. The area, the views, the train we took (highly",

          "We did the combined ticket of the Palace and the Aquarium (best value). The palace is an amazing glimpse into the history of monarchy in Europe. The tour includes an audio tour. The overall tour is only through a small portion of the palace since it is still used as",
          "Whilst in Monaco you need to visit the Palace and square - the views from up there are superb - and you can \"plot\" the whole of the F1 track",

          "A must visit if you go to Monaco. Lovely grounds all around and the view is stunning. i didn't go into the Palace but i was told it was worth seeing (not enough time on my trip)",
          "It was great to see guards changing. Palace location is really great and view from top is beautiful. Worth spending time. Lovely panaromic view.",
          "The architecture of this place is unbelievable. The building designs are amazing and the views all around are incredible! It can be very busy at midday when the guards walk out, but other than that it was great!",
          "Wander up to the rock of Monaco to find this place. Beautiful little palace but really dwarfed by the panoramic views it offers of monte carlo across the bay. We saw the changing on the guard - a bit dissapointing, but head up here for the views. Picturesque.",
          "We managed to tour the palace on the last day of the season, and are very glad we could. It is beautiful, and that is coming from people who have been to their fair share of royal palaces around Europe. There is an audio guide included if you like that sort of thing, but it",
          "We were lucky to be on time for the change of guards it was simply beautiful the area the views can\u2019t get enough",
          "The palace is beautiful, but what catch my attention was the breathtaking views from the sea you\u2019ll see from there. Simply amazing and I got really amazed by the scene... it was a sunny day, so... as anyone knows, the sun and the blue sky are the best filter!",
          "What an impressive place and the narrative about its occupants. Shame photos are precluded anywhere within the palace.",
          "We were able to get to the palace in time for the changing of the guard. Which was pretty neat. Monaco is just so beautiful. Hit the little shops around the palace. There is some nice little restaurants tucked away. Take the walk down to the harbor. Not a difficult walk.",
          "We did not pre-book for anything in Monaco during June and never queued for entry either. Without the the audio tour of the Prince's Palace, I think it may be a bit boring, but the commentary gave enough information to give meaning to what one sees. I was pleasantly surprised at",
          "The changing of the guards was built up to be quite an event. There were probably 200 people there for the event that lasted all of 90 seconds - move to the other side of the square for fantastic views over Port Hercule instead!",
          "What a beautiful place final resting place for grace and the prince on the palace cathedral close to the palace wow. Beautiful gardens overlooking spectacular views to Monaco marina breathtaking views. Monte Carlo what a place went into the casino didn\u2019t think they would let us",
          "We found the walk up to the palace lovely with plenty of spots to take pictures and clean public rest rooms. The changing of the guards is at 11:45. It is something to see. Not spectacular but still interesting and in December the crowds are thin, ability to take nice pictures",
          "For best pictures of Monte Carlo I recommend going there. I walked up from the harbour to the palace which was a hike but it was very much worth it at the end. The views are stunning. I was there when the guards changed (around sunset) . It was interesting to see.",
          "We was here in July when it's hot. There is a stairway to the palace. Have water with you, it's very hot. Details of the palace and surroundings you can see on our Youtube Channel: Dan & Beka journey. ENJOY!",
          "A must, you can't miss it in Monte-Carlo. Don't miss the guard-change too (11.45 about). Not very amazing for a Royal Palace, maybe for its modest look, but go and take a look. The are lots of nice shops to buy presents of your journey. Have fun!",
          "A visit takes journey of history from Guelfes to the Napoleonic period You can admire : The Italian style gallery 16th century depicting mythological scenes. The Luis 15th salon,the marvellous harmony of gold and blue. The Throne room ,where historical festivals and ceremonies",

          "Monaco is a strange place; a bit like being in the Trueman show. The hike to the top of this hill is disappointing when you get here. Not a great view, just boats and a castle that looks like it is built out of breeze blocks. The whole place feels like it has no soul. Probably",
          "Excellent Views of the Harbor from the Top of the Mountain. An adjacent Old Town provides for shopping and quaint little restaurants on the narrow streets.",
          "You only really see one wing of the palace but the audio guide (part of the entry fee) brings it to life and it is well worth seeing.",
          "It is a beautiful palace with a huge courtyard. You will see a few room: bedrooms, offices, official rooms, library. Every one is in a different style, colour and very unique. No photos/ videos allowed! Entrance is 8\u20ac. It is a truly and unforgettable experience!",
          "As residence for a somewhat old royal family, this Palace has very unimpressive architecture. From plaza, It looks more like a reconstructed military barracks. The exhibits inside were okay, most of the rooms were drably lit. The throne room was an utter disappointment. It\u2019s a",

          "I visited the Palace of the Prince and for me it was fantastic. I am not interested in the cars museum so I only visited the Palace. Rooms were beautifully decorated. I loved the blue room; it is indeed a magical place. There are two big downsides that you need to know before",

          "I did not visit inside the palace, just went to the square for the views and to see the change of the guards. Sweeping views of Monte Carlo harbor. You can also meander through the old town streets and walk down to the church. Very nice walk and old streets. Recommend it fir the",
          "A very good place to get a wonderful view and spend a while up there. there are cafes, shops and souvenirs stores.",
          "We live in near the massive central of France, with very cold winters so we decided to spend Christmas in Monaco. I am pleased with the weather. We walked a lot and enjoyed the beautiful gardens around. very lovely place to visit and very clean too.",
          "We purchased tickets for the private car collection and the palace for \u20ac11.50. The palace passed 20 minutes and was interesting to see how the rich live and lived. Impressive views from the outside. As you leave your given a 5% discount voucher for the gift shop.",
          "Great to spend sometime outside the palace looking at the views. The palace itself has some interesting bits but \u20ac8 addmission is the right price as it took me around 45 mins to do the full audio tour. Make sure your visit coincides with the 11:55am changing of the guard, well",
          "We wanted to see the palace and to be honest we\u2019re a little disappointed as there\u2019s. It much to see. You can go thru it 20 min or less. While all the rooms are beautiful and very well maintained, I was hoping for more information on the royal family. Maybe because they still",
          "The Prince's Palace is located high above the harbor. For those staying close to the harbor and unable to walk up (or prefer not to), the local bus and taxis can take you there. The views from the Prince's Palace were extraordinary and panoramic, and my favorite views of",
          "We visited here on a summer's evening and it was very peaceful and beautiful. The guards were still present and there wasn't large crowds so it was easy to get nice photos of the palace and of views down to the port.",
          "Bought a combined ticket for oceanarium and palace at 19\u20ac an adult. The two places are 15 minute up hill walk apart with the cathedral in between. Money is being spent on the internals of the palace and refurbishment is still on going but it is updating the state rooms that had",
          "It's a bit of a strenuous walk up to this location but then again there's no rush - whilst the ascent from the harbour-side town area below can be challenging, so be warned, you can get here having had chance to sit and rest. We didn't go into the Palace .... obviously but it is",
          "If you are in Monaco, touring the Palace should be on your list of things to do - especially if you are visiting Monaco for the first time or if you think this is going to be the only time you ever visit. Just don\u2019t expect it to be as grand, large, or impressive as many other",
          "Our guide timed the trip to perfection as we arrived 5 minutes to 12 just as the soldiers were lining up for the changing of the guard....just a pity about 300 other people had the same idea.",
          "It looks like a small fort from the outside, and doesn\u2019t have much to distinguish it architecturally. The changing of the guard is a comparatively drab ceremony by soldiers in unremarkable uniforms. And don\u2019t buy from any of the souvenir shops facing the palace. Prices are",
          "Definitely a must see, even though very little of the palace is actually open to the public. You can buy a ticket just for the palace museum, or add on the automobile museum, which is in a different part of the city centre. The ticket office has a minimum purchase if you want to",
          "We got the hop on hop off tour bus from the casino at stop 5 to the Prince\u2019s Palace at stop 7 and lucky for us we arrived at 11.45am. Just in time for the changing of the guards! It started at 11.55am and lasted for 5mins. It is a must see in Monaco! We then proceeded to the",
          "Good insights into the world of royalty. You can enjoy what you see but cannot take photos. But it is worth it. We saw the changing of the guards and then did the tour of the palace. We bought the combined ticket of the Prince's Palace and the Museum of Oceanography. Enjoyed",
          "For an art enthusiast, there are a lot to see. Almost every sculpture, every piece of furniture, and every piece of porcelain are worth a close look at. And the fabric wallpapers and chandeliers look imposing. Paintings are relatively lacklustre. It's a shame that we're not",
          "We stopped in here for the tour and the line took as much time as the tour did. The tour probably lasts about 25-30 minutes. It was nice to see the rooms and listen to the self guided tour. Rather interesting how the super wealthy lived. It is pretty much a quick history lesson",
          "Quite a walk up with steep steps, although enjoyable. However, you can now use lifts/escalators to get you some or all of the way up. Once there the views over the bay are lovely. There are benches, toilets etc at the top so you can relax looking at the views. We got there",
          "At 8 Euros entrance, including a good audio guide, a visit to the palace interior represents excellent value for money. You see twelve, generally lavish rooms, though I recommend you get there early before the bulk of the tourists arrive as I imagine the rooms soon get crowded.",
          "Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress it has been bombarded and overtaken by many foreign powers. Prince Rainier III is credited for restoring the Palace to its former glory. This was one of our stops on our tour for photo opportunities, but we did not take a tour of the inside.",
          "At 11:55 this event happens daily. Quite the pomp and circumstance involved. Definitely worth watching. Get there 20 minutes early as it does get crowded.",
          "I bought online ticket for couple months before I go to Monaco. The palace full of history but you can't access in many areas. There are staff and guards everywhere. I understand that royal family is living there. The souvenir coin in front of the palace is very nice. You can",
          "Came to the palace to watch the change of guard, was really great very very busy but highly recommended",
          "It is situated at the west side of the port, not very well signposted and is quite a walk up the hill, but well worth it. After reaching the top there are lovely small streets with shops, cafes and restaurants, we seemed to arrive at the perfect time 12noon to see the changing",
          "I had the chance to visit this Prince's Palace in Monaco last Summer, but it was not all open to visitors and the tour was very limited place. However; it was a nice visit to be acquainted with this type of Monarchies.",
          "The steps up to it are steep so might be hard to get up in a wheel chair I no you can get a taxi up to it , the palace was closed when we where there but you could see the changing of the guards , there are lovely shops and restaurants up there and break taking views of Monaco",
          "My favorite attractions were the changing of the guard and the beautiful view of the two ports. The visit inside the palace was interesting but the section open to the public is quite small.",
          "A small but nice Palace in a fabulous square offering stunning views over Monte Carlo and the surrounding areas. The guards frequently march in front of the Palace and look very smart in their uniforms. Well worth a visit, even for the views from the square.",
          "Beautiful building. Didn\u2019t go inside and missed the changing of guards but the guards walking around looked very smartly dressed.",
          "After arriving at the train station we headed straight to the Prince's Palace end of Monaco. Being so hilly it can be quite a difficult place to navigate, you cannot walk straight to anything. After climbing up to the Princes Palace there were a lot of people crowded around,",
          "This was the final point of our walk through Monaco. Great construction and offers a nice panoramic view.",
          "Immaculate and preened this royal fantasy has to be seen. Try to avoid when the cruise boaters arrive but there is room for all. One of the Top 10 in Monaco.",
          "Beautiful palace with stunning views of the ocean and the yacht. Waited to see the parade of the changing guards. The very nice place to hang around for the whole day.",
          "I forgot to make this review about Monaco\u2019s Palace, but besides being F1 weekend, it was Prince Albert\u2019s wedding the following week or so, the city looked amazing, the Palace grounds were being prepared with fresh planted flowers, everything, though seeming perfect, was being",
          "The changing of the guard occurred at 5 to noon. It only lasts 5 minutes. The palace itself was not open this month.",
          "Monaco was the highlight of our trip. So beautiful! We visited in January when it was very quiet but still warm. What a magnificent palace.",
          "The palace itself is nice with guards standing outside and I believe they have some sort of changing of the guards. However the views nearby overlooking the sea are absolutely breathtaking",
          "Loved entering this palace, it was well organized tour with lots of nice historical information that i found very interesting and i enjoyed my visit.",
          "The palace is not as embellished as many of the palaces in other parts of Europe but it is still interesting to watch the changing of the guard take place. The square is blocked to some traffic during the changing of the troops at the post across from the palace.",
          "The palace is on top of the hill but I don't think you can go inside the palace, On both side there is quite a view especially on the side overlooking the beautiful harbor- really breathtaking. You may go back by bus or just walk, there is pathway going down.",
          "The palace itself is nice, a bit plain but still interesting if you like royalty. But it's well worth spending a bit of time up there as the views on both ends of the palace are amazing!",
          "The building looks new, but cant be! Interesting soldier guards out front. Lots of security in the vicinity. Great views.",
          "Monte Carlo and Monaco in general could be skipped if it were not for the fame the city state has. We went to Monaco out of curiosity while in Nice. We could have stayed in Nice and not really missed anything...but on with the Prince\u2019s Palace! The palace sits on top of a hill",
          "Nice place for a Palace with downward looking vertical views of the harbors on both sides. While we were visiting the area all we could see was the outside of the Palace building and the Palace guard as the Palace interior was closed for the season. The view of the two harbors",
          "We have visited here twice this year, it is well worth the walk up, the views from either side of the square are breath taking",
          "They do a fantastic job of managing the crowds. We were here the end of July and though it was crowded, the very informative audio tour keep the lines moving at a pleasant pace. It was a wonderful day.",
          "I love the place ! My daughter and her baby enjoyed it a lot. It has a magnificent view everywhere. Although some shops are close on a sunday there were small shops that were open. I can always go back there again and again and not get tired. However we ha",
          "Take the lift up to the hill and get great views over Monaco Be there for 1145 hrs for the changing of the guard Then stroll the streets in the area",
          "A beautiful palace and square fit for a prince. Not crowded and good for a stroll to the many restaurants and gelaterrias and cafes in the area. Lots of kitchsy touristy souvieniers to be found everywhere. The guards were still in their summer white uniforms and have a grand",
          "The mount on which the palace sits overlooks the main city and the Monte Carlo neighborhood, along with its iconic waterfront. The palace itself is a clean and simple design, so take a few photos there. Then walk a few meters away and take some shots of the spectacular view",
          "This tour reminds one that a well told tale can enhance the image of even a small company, attraction or country. The princes palace tour makes one think Monaco is more important that it is or has been and does show off the ruling family in a favorable light. Each room visited",
          "The palace is amazing. Lots of historical sites to see. The changing of the guards is a must see. The view is amazing. Many great little restaurants to eat at while you are there. Some shops but wasn't really impressed with them . Lots of people. You can ride up and down",
          "While the Palace is not a huge place, it is interesting to see where the royal family live. Long lines to tour so we just looked around outside. The Palace is also situated on a square in front of it which has all kinds of souvenir shops.",
          "Monaco is a lovely place but filled to the brim with tourists. The palace and the changing of the guard were interesting but not the best of Europe. Yet, who could miss the place where Grace Kelly became royalty?",
          "Well kept grounds, a beautiful palace. It is worth visiting the area and spectacular views of the marina.",
          "Can only see the outside of building with a standing guard. Nothing really impressive. Happens to have a change of guard and captured the video.",
          "Fascinating view of the Royal family and its history. Beautiful palace with some great exhibits and interesting commentary on the mobile guide.",
          "Perched high on a rock the Grimaldi family palace looks resplendent in the sunshine. The audio guided tour is excellent. There is so much history attached to the place. Best of all is the changing of the Palace guard at 11.55 daily.",
          "Not many rooms to see, but the blue room and one bedroom are especially awesome. You can tour it all in less than one hour. The old town across the square has some lovely buildings, but is mostly shops with T shirts.",
          "An impressive looking palace set in a large square with nearby views over the harbour, the entrance ticket can be combined with either the Oceanographic institute or the car collection, but oddly, not both. Nonetheless, prices seemed quite reasonable. A free audio guide was",
          "I loved this palace and the faculty it looked very normal compared to some of the other Palaces we have seen throughout Europe, it does not show off its wealth. It's located in a lovely square with 2 look out areas, one of the ocean and the other of stunning Monaco. Hey I could",
          "I would suggest starting by getting there around 1130h and heading over to the ticket office to purchase your ticket for the Palace tour. There is a 30 minute or so audio guide that you get when yo check in. If you are looking at the palace front turn to your left and head over",
          "As much as I enjoyed getting to see this it is quite expensive depending on which tour you do. However for \u20ac8 each to see the palace it is beautiful. There is however limited rooms to see and our of respect to the family still living there no photos are allowed. Which is",
          "I can imagine that during high season, this place can be a zoo, but when we were there it was very easy. There are tours of the Palace available but we opted out.",
          "Must see the changing of the guards. Quite a bit of pomp and ceremony around this. Impressive palace set on top of the hill with a beautiful view over the harbour",
          "Not too grand a place but interesting all the same. It is quite compact as you only get to see a few rooms that are still in use. There is an interesting room with some of the previous monarchs paintings. The most interesting one though is Princess Grace and Rainier with their",
          "It is so natural that you love this place, simple atmosphere, and changing of the guards happens every hour.",
          "Location and views from gardens are awesome. We climbed the steps from Monte Carlo. It not that difficult. In old town in front of the palace you can find souvenirs and food.",
          "There are buses but me and my family decided to walk my mother she managed the walk ok when you get to the top there are markets to buy drinks and snacks that are priced ok. The views are good and walking down is a lot easier then waling up.",
          "Make sure to get a coupon book at the visitor center in the train station (go up the escalators) to get \u20ac2 euro off the entrance fee. The palace itself is very plain on the outside but just gorgeous inside with its Renaissance frescoes and paintings as well as architecture. I",
          "The walk up to the Princes Palace is via a long staircase which has long evenly spaced out stairs which can be used by wheelchairs and pushchairs. On the walk up you are gifted with the most beautiful views of the harbour and all the fine boats. We were not expecting to find",
          "Palace is situated overlooking Monte Carlo. We only had a short time to visit so didn't get to go inside. Wasn't too expensive looking at prices in ticket office, would like to have seen the car collection. Saw the changing of the guard, a little bit amateur, and they weren't",
          "I thought the Prince's Palace was a little small inside and it did not take long to look around. This is to be expected, with Monaco being such a small country it's royal palace was unlikely to rival those in other major european capitals.",
          "This was worth a quick visit. I'd recommend getting the audio guide, as it gives a nice amount of information. There is only a small portion of the palace open to visitors as the royal family still actually live and work there.",
          "Definitely visit here. I learned so much about the monarchy and the history of Monaco. This is a must see!",
          "Witness the change of guards in the Palace. Beautiful seaview, mountains, luxurious yachts, expensive houses & great buildings is a WOW feeling. Restaurants and coffee shops are a bit pricey compare to other eu countries. but a must try. The view of the city is amazing! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "This is a goodplace for walking around and take pics. Also you can see the the changing of the guard.",
          "The Palace isn't amazing, I have seen more elaborate Palaces but what i loved about it was the homely feel, the cosiness of the palace and you could imagine the Grimaldi's feeling totally at home here. You get to see some of the bedrooms, the throne room and the famous flight of",
          "Prince's Palace is a must when touring Monaco because of its fantastic views. Although the hike up many stairs to get to the Palace is brutal, it is well worth it. There are many shops and restaurants along with the huge palace. The views of Monaco are the best part, as they",
          "before seeing the palace take a walk round the old town on top of the hill ,visit the cathedral and gardens. i thought 8 euros was a fair entrance price which includes a audio tours .the tour takes about an hour. from the palace you get some great views of the port",
          "Went for a walk up to the palace. But that's about it. Never found it worth to go inside. Nothing special.",
          "Beautiful area where you can get up close to the prince's palace. You have to walk uphill to get there so wear comfortable shoes. Walking would be tough for those who can't walk for long. Once you get up, enjoy the views of Monaco and the harbor. We were there in the",
          "Another must if visiting Monte-Carlo. The palace is regal and captivating. Take a stroll through the narrow streets, visit the churches and stop to browse in the many shops or just have a coffee and watch the world go by. A spectacular view to take photographs looking down on",
          "This was a grade guided tour of Monaco we walked from the harbour, to the Oceanography museum, then throught the gardens to St Paul's Church, where we spent 10 minutes in there. we then walked up to the Palace just in time to see the chaning of the guards which is a must see",
          "We were here with the family, but we have not visited inside the palace. We took some pictures outside, of the palace and the great view from this area, saw the soldiers marching, and went for souvenirs shopping in the small streets around the palace.",
          "Visited here with a teenager; we bought the tickets and audio guide was great! Easy to use and very informative. Definitely get up and go early though, then you can see the changing of the guard afterwards. Interesting visit.",
          "We bought a combined e-ticket to visit the palace and the oceanographic museum of Monaco. Despite that we were waiting under the sun for 45 minutes to visit this palace.It was not what we expected to see. Small and without any impressive items. Since most visitors stay in Monaco",
          "Not too big and really cute. A must see in Monaco. The architecture of this Palace is beautiful. It wasn't crowded at all. I didn't do the visit but next time I come, I'd definitely do it.",
          "We did not plan our visit in advance and purchased the aquarium/palace ticket package....very glad we did! Very interesting to the whole family to see the active and historic residence, including rooms and furniture apparently used by previous 'tenants'! The audio guide was very",
          "The palace is on a lovely square where you can watch the changing of the guard. We missed that but friends said that they really enjoyed it. You get an audio tour so that the apartments can be viewed at your own pace and in your own language. Only part of the palace can be",
          "Walking inside the castle that is actually the residence of the current prince is worth a visit. We did not manage to get the introduced, but the audio guided tour helps you to understand the background of mono a, a better understanding of the Grimaldi's and a sneak peek in some",
          "We were at the palace half-hour before the change of guard at 11:55 am. Walking around the plaza and then seeing the short ceremony was regal. Then we went to visit the open areas of the palace and it was great. Some of the rooms are used for official functions and it's the",
          "Beautiful small palace in a cute plaza. Restaurant and shop in streets around.quite a treck up the stairs but beautiful view and lift always available like anywhere in Monaco.",
          "It is the must see when you visit the principality. This is the official residence of the seat of power in Monaco currently Prince Albert. The history is interesting and palace is one of the best maintained in the World. I am often surprised so many visitors never see one of the",
          "Definitely worth the visit. The prince's palace is the place of residency of Prince Albert II of Monaco. You get a recorder as a guide with the entry fee",
          "Very interesting visit to the Palace, I saw the palace in magazines so many times and walking inside was very interesting, I saw the palace was bigger inside, specially the throne room",
          "We walked to the top of the mountain to visit the Princes Palace (we did not go inside the palace as we where short on time- tickets where about 8 Euro per adult for the palace and 12 Euro for the palace and car collection per adult). The Princes Palace offers unbelievable views",
          "We visited this through the discounted dual ticket of the Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique a bit further. It's nice to visit and if you're a fan of the XVI-XIXth century castles you'll be fulfilled. If you're not, then you can skip this.",
          "You will only be able to see a few rooms of the palace, but all them are worth it, in particular for the price asked. It is very rich yet it is not very posh, which is a rare combination.",
          "Lovely to visit Monaco and the Pink Palace! Take bottles of water as it's some climb up to the top! Stunning views and gorgeous wee streets off the palace to eat/ shop and browse the property prices! Loved it \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Well I guess it's cool to have seen it but it's not really something to look forward to. The small alleys nearby though is very nice to walk and have a pizza in. The view is pretty good as well.",
          "We arrived and walked here in the early morning, outside the palace are great views of the city.Very interesting visit with audio, stories about each room. But a litte bit expensive",
          "The entire square is lovely and a timeless place to experience the Royalty, that is Monaco. One could spend the whole day wandering and taking the place where Princess Grace lived. It's just wonderful!",
          "Lovely place visit with audio although not enough of the place revealed . Rooms are beautiful with antique paintings and furniture. I don't think Albert has changed anything for the last 400 years",
          "Our visit got a pissy start as the person selling the tickets would not sell us a student ticket even though we had an international student card. She just kept incisting that it could be anything. The card is quite modern as you only have it on your phone ect. and it has all",
          "Had limited time - so didn't do the tour - but a must visit place when in Monaco. A great viewpoint from both sides - where you will have great photo opportunities.",
          "The self-guided tour is interesting enough but it's quite pricey and no photos are allowed to fuel one's memories. Be warned, airport security with priority to tour groups and so we stood in the sun for 20 minutes waiting for a party of aged Germans to come to grips with",
          "We walked up to here whilst exploring Monaco and then did the train tour. It is a very steep walk but a pretty one. It was a busy hot day and we did watch the changing of the guards which was fascinating to watch. How they cope in the heat baffles me! Amazing views of the port",
          "Walked past here but didn't go inside. It was very crowded due to the guard procession. Seems to be the centerpiece Monaco tour.",
          "The self-guided tour of the palace includes some amazingly decorated rooms, including the throne room. The tour includes an audio guide which was interesting and talked about some specific paintings or items in each room, and provides a brief overview of the history of the royal",
          "Walking along the port, I took steep stairs to reach Prince's Palace of Monaco that has been transformed into one of the most luxurious residences in the world. he magnificent Throne Room is where all official ceremonies, such as swearing-in-of-high ranking state officials and",
          "This was a reasonably priced tour and if time is short it does not take too long. It was very interesting and we both enjoyed it . The audio guides had us rather confused at the beginning - we had walked on too far and had to retrace our steps! We walked up to the palace and the",
          "A palace which is still inhabited and it is not only a museum. Since the end of the 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family until todays. The palace is a blend of architectural styles and the rooms contain ornate 18th-century French-style",
          "Being in Monaco there were a couple things on our list that we had to do. The Palace tour being one. It is very reasonable to get in. You can buy your tickets in advance which is nice being that the crowds grow thru out the day. It is a recorded tour thru the palace. It is",
          "The Palace looks like new! It has guards marching in front of the entrance. It is the residence of Prince Albert de Monaco.",
          "We caught the local bus 100 from Nice to Monaco, a great choice and it costs only 1.50 \u20ac per person one way. It runs every 15 minutes and the trip takes about 30-45 minutes travelling along the coastline. We were there only a few days prior to the Formula 1 car race so the town",
          "The palace itself is beautiful to behold. Our driver had to park a short walk away and direct us on foot to visit the site. It's located on a courtyard accessed by many narrow streets with many vendors and shoppes. There is limited auto access to this courtyard at the front",
          "I went to the palace during the changing of the guards, and that was really cool to see! It was a bit of a walk up there, but I'm pretty sure there are buses as well. The palace is really pretty and the area around it is very cute as well. A lot of restaurants and souvenir",
          "We couldnt get near because of some maintenance works. Guard in front of palace. Palace which is amazing. Historic surrounding. Really nice view for eyes.",
          "We stopped off here at the palace for a tour, after our picnic lunch near the palace, which was very nice. It is a beautiful palace but not so big that you get to tired to finish the tour. I was very impressed with the tour and it was just the right length of time that you",
          "We thought the palace would be like the casino as far as the grandeur but the rooms seemed old and small. The history is nice and the audio tour is helpful...but it was 'OK'. The views are pretty from up top. Make sure you take time walking the gardens going down to the",
          "Possibility to see some places of the palace. Honestly I was a bit disappointed because I expected to see more and because neither could take photos nor film.",
          "About half of the palace is open to tourists. It is well worth the wait to go through and view the history, furnishings, antiques of the Monaco royalty. Self guided tour so you can spend longer at items you want to review. No pictures allow in the palace, strictly enforced.",
          "The cost to visit this Palace was 8Euros per adult, however you can buy a combination ticket to include the Aquarium or the Motor car museum which is a good saving, however we visited the motor museum first and they did not tell us this, so we paid full price admission at both",
          "Climb the steps to the Prince's Palace (toilets available half way up!) and you are rewarded with stunning views of Monaco, the pretty palace and narrow streets of gift shops and reasonably priced cafes. We enjoyed sitting in the shade with a 5 euro baguette in the beautiful",
          "The Prince's Palace is well worth a visit when in Monaco. The palace gives you a great introduction into the life of Monaco's rich and famous. The entrance fee of 8 euros takes you through many of the rooms showing examples of great wealth and includes many portraits of the",
          "The Prince's palace and the square in front of it were nice to see. Unfortunately they were not changing the guard while we were there. Across from the palace there are several cafes and souvenir shops with very reasonably priced items.....I initially thought they had put the",
          "Certainly worth the visit and 8 euros entry. Most enjoyable and interesting. Lovely antiques and furniture in all of the rooms and excellent audio to accompany the visit.Regards Gary Saunders.",
          "You can either walk up or arrive by the sightseeing Red Bus on it's route by the Palace. Try to get there to see the changing of the guard. The Palace itself is very interesting.",
          "Sorry to be negative but I wish we had not visited. The tour (audio tour) took us 10 minutes and we waited twenty. You get to see @ 4 rooms and you get no real flavour of the family except in the last cheesy painting of all of them together. Luckily it is only \u00a38 but I would",
          "The palace looks good, but that's really all there is to it. I did not go inside the palace, only watched from outside. It's not a must to go here.",
          "Partially visible at the top of the hill rather spectacular as the highest point in downtown Monaco.",
          "The Palace offers an audio-guided tour and to our surprise greek was included in the languages offered, so my parents were able to be totally independent! The actual exhibition and the walk-through the Palace's rooms is well-arranged and, on a rather slow pace, the whole tour",
          "Very interesting visit with an amazing guide who took us through the palace telling us very interesting stories about each room, its decoration and the objects.",
          "Very popular and beautiful place to visit ,you can't make any pictures for security reasons , so keep your eyes wide open",
          "Well worth the walk up to the top to see the palace, also offers various restaurants, side cafes to stop for refreshments. The small Monaco train also runs up and down to if you don't fancy the steps up",
          "The main part of town doesn't have a coastal walk that gives the best views. But up at the palace the view is great! I'd recommend heading up the hill just for the view and to see the guards do their thing.",
          "Not something we had on our list to visit but glad we did. They supply audio for you so you can get information on each room you see. We went on a Sunday and were quite surprised that it was not very busy. Found the history very interesting. Was a little disappointed we could",
          "This was a great way to get some background on the palace and the royalty that have lived there. It is a self paced audio tour with units for different languages. The whole tour took under an hour. There are no pictures allowed so plan accordingly.",
          "The palace had a lot to see and each room was very detailed. I enjoyed it but disappointed you couldn't take photos.",
          "We had to visit this palace, since we had heard the story of Princess Grace and Prince Ranier since we were kids. Audio guides (like cell phones) are provided in your preferred language, and they do a good job of directing the tourist to the relevant areas and describing the",
          "Go for the view from the top, the town looks so beautiful. The narrow streets, beautiful Palace and the changing event of the Palace guards was an excellent experience. Small cafes and restaurants with local delicacies is plus.",
          "The visit here was more about the family history than of Princess Grace. The princess occupied a good portion of the tour, but the family history before and after Grace provided a detailed invite of this remarkable family.",
          "The climb up to Monaco-Ville, the old fortified city on the Rock which includes the Prince's Palace, Cathedral and Oceanographic Museum is on a gentle gradient but steep enough to make you 'feel' the climb. Stop on the way up and take photos out over the bay of the marina full",
          "This tour takes around 30mins, the history is fascinating, the audio device you're given describes each room or item of interest, the rooms you visit account for a very small part of the overall palace, but you get a great idea of how the other half live.",
          "We went to the Prince\u00b4s Palace not for the Palace but for the wonderful and spectacular view over Monaco. It was worth the effort of climbing some steps. The view is awesome. If you can, try to catch sunset from this top spot. There are some nice bars at the large square where",
          "We spent a half day visiting this place. We got luck when we came they changed guards. We could enjoy the view to surrounding areas. The place is super-clean. We would come back definitely.",
          "Really enjoyed this, spent a couple of hours wandering around looking at the palace and cathedral and area. We walked up but did not realize there was a lift! Great views and wonderful gardens, so much more here then we thought.",
          "It is self guided audio tour through a few of the public rooms of the palace where the prince lives. Beautiful, but nothing particularly noteworthy. This part of the palace is still used for formal events, but as expected you are roped off into hallways and only see one wing",
          "Recently visited here as part of a trip for my girlfriends birthday. We were not disappointed with our visit to the palace and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Monaco. The tour itself is very informative and talks you through all the various rooms and grandeur of",
          "We purchased our tickets ahead of time to visit the palace, but you can buy at the door. They are not open year-round so worth looking into when they are open. We purchased the tickets that gives you access to the Prince's car collection also. We had someone in line with us",
          "Absolutely stunning view from the top of the mountain in Monaco. Old and very scenic building that you can photograph and look at for hours.. - VeloceInternational.com",
          "More than a few steps from the marina, the walk up the hill is invigorating and worth the views of the Mediterranean, gardens and Garibaldi palace. The changing of the guard is held precisely at 11:55 which is worth the time to wait and see. Not as grandiose as the Buckminster",
          "Climb a few steps from the street/marina level and you'll be up in the clouds over looking Monaco marina, the view extends past the marina out into the ocean but also back over to the city. Over the other side of the square/courtyard there is a view of the smaller marina (Port",
          "Nice place to see , over there you can see a good view of the city , also cafe around , very clean and trendy but also peaceful , a must see !!!",
          "We stopped here while staying in Nice. Great little country. tough to get around. Castle was nice and only takes about 30-40 minutes. Free audio guide is included.",
          "Stayed in Menton and visited Monte Carlo. Always beautiful and never miss it when in the area. Walked the way up to the Palace and also visited the Church Princes Grace is buried in.",
          "Monaco was a dream come true to me, Grace Kelly's home. And the palace, oh well, just perfect, it's like a fairy tale place, everything is perfect there and clean.",
          "Walked from the train station to the palace and arrived just as a changing of the guard was in progress. Great views from the surroundings. Trinket and cap shops proliferate on the narrow streets, along with small cafes and street food. There are an uncommon number of beautiful",
          "It was quite a climb but well worth it. Could use the on/off tourist bus. The views from the grounds are quite stunning.",
          "Realy beautiful place. Quiet with history Interresting specialy when you can watch the change of\"carabiniers du Prince\"",
          "somehow curious to cross borders just walking on a street, that little gem Monaco, elegant, precious and so normal. felling good, just a sensation of something different but good, I feel kind of the same in Manhattan. hard to explain, let say is a bit of magic.",
          "Incredible views after climbing the numerous steps up to the palace, but unfortunately once we were there, we were unable to go in there. The streets are the area surrounding it are lovely, and feel very 'french', but overall, would only visit for the views.",
          "If this was the only reason to stop in Monaco, then one can pass. It is nice and quaint with streets literally cleaned every day but you cannot visit inside. It almost feels like an attraction made for tourists only despite being an actual historical building. Nice views",
          "This was a must for us on our day trip. We caught the hop on hop off tour bus, great way to get around Monaco. We made sure we got here for the changing of the guard, 11 oclock .What a great performance. The place was really clean and you had great views over Monaco. Really",
          "Historial building, no glittery decorations, just nice and clean. You are not allowed to visit inside, but the building and the surroundings are well worth the trip up there anyway. The old town on the castle hill is in great contrast to the rest of Monaco.",
          "This is a great way to have fantastic views over the city. It is spotlessly clean and very picturesque. Lots of little shops and place to eat. Highly recommended",
          "The historic area of Monaco is actually very pretty... the Prince's Palace is beautiful. The entire area is charming and is worth a day of exploring. I can't say as much for the Monte Carlo area... busy with lots of 60's high rises... though the casino itself is pretty. If",
          "Nice views of the bay from the top, you can't visit inside the Palace, there are a few guards at the entrance.",
          "Whilst in Monte-Carlo on a business trip with colleagues we had a free day. A walk along the Harbour then up to the Palace for 11am to see the changing of the guard. The views were beautiful. A visit around the shops in all the narrow streets around the old part of",
          "Very nice building in the midst of a large square. The palace is located near many apartments as well as churches and a museum. Unlike other palaces that are hidden away from the public in the countryside or other private locations, it's amongst the public.",
          "You will certainly pass by the palace when visiting the old city of Monaco, but there isn't much to see of the palace from outside",
          "Having been to Buckingham Palace & Versailles earlier on our honeymoon trip, my wife & I weren't overly impressed with this Palace, as there was nothing special about it and the walk up to the top was quite long. Don't get me wrong though, the Palace looks big and the guard",
          "We are from Philadelphia, home of Princess Grace Kelly, so this was the highlight of my European tour. The headphones were great for the boys, ages 11,10 and 8. We loved seeing the changing of the guard ceremony. Would like to have seen more information about seeing the",
          "Nothing amazing, just your usual huge european palace with a changing of the guard but if you are here in Monte Carlo of course check it out. Walking just a little bit away from palace gives incredible views though of the harbor and the city",
          "Came here when on our holiday . A slight walk up the hill however great views over the harbour , port and the town. Great places for pictures. Also you will be able to see the guards outside.",
          "The Palace is situated on a hill. A bit of a walk but spectacular views all around on the way up. Punctuate the walk up by stopping and taking some lovely shots of Monaco. We were unable to see the changing of the guards...we were there the wrong day. Lots of boutique-like",
          "The square on which Prince's Palace sits is perched on top of the hill where there's magnificent views of the entirety of Monaco. The harbour in Monaco is called Port Hercules. Cause there\u2019s gonna be plenty of big yachts and big cruise ships making port. This cathedral just",
          "Just fine. Not much to see there, though there are surprising many amazing secret spots to discover, if you are smart..",
          "The Prince's Palace of Monaco was home of the Grimaldi family, it's perfectly located in one of the highest parts of the city with a beautiful view perfect to spot the whole harbor and city, Be there for the changing of the guards, it's a must!",
          "We were brought here on a guided tour and so were in time to see the changing of the guard at noon. A little band marches out and there's a lot of ceremonial presentation of arms and the like.",
          "We queued in the hot sun to enter the palace reception where security was tight and unfriendly. We picked up an audio guide and ambled through the rooms where the history of the first family of this Principality was told. Most of it was interesting. I found the artifacts",
          "The views from the top are really good, loads to see from up there and there's loads to do in Monaco in general",
          "Coming here requires a little bit of effort but it is worthy. Although we were not able to enter in the palace, we found it very beautiful.",
          "It's a fairly steep climb up the stairs to the Palace, but affords a great view of Monaco. The changing of the guard is daily at 11.55 am, not all that interesting but we were lucky to see the Prince and family arrive with a very big police bike escort into the Palace just",
          "Typically if you are traveling from Nice or other close areas you will have 1/2 a day to roam around and get lost in Monaco. This is definitely something you should do when you get there... and do it right when you are there. The fee for the tour is minimal but you will learn",
          "The changing of the gaurd was interesting, but otherwise rather boring looking at the building. Do the Prince and Princess live there?",
          "Although it was not possible to visit palace itself at a time of our visit, it'd still worth to walk up to see its main entrance. Quite nice and picturesque building indeed.",
          "Like all good travelers, if you go to Monaco, you must go to the Palace and watch the changing of the Guard. It's a bit of a climb, whether you walk along the sea wall or take a route through the City so you don't want to be disappointed for your effort. However, fate had other",
          "We happened to be in the area when the Changing of the Guard was taking place. It was enjoyable to see how this is done and the precision of the guard.",
          "I have rated the attraction highly more for the area than the Palace itself. Whilst the latter was interesting to some extent, I found it to be without great character and was actually more interested in the old-town alley ways and adjoining square. Sure, the place is a tourist",
          "Worth the walk up from the main town. Good vies of Port Hercule on way up.Not a very large Palace but seeped in history. The day I visited there was no changing of the guard. Very busy, lots of tourist.",
          "It is worth to visit but I must point out, if you expect this palace like any other ones you had seen, it is not really comparable. It is very small and simple. The old town around the palace is a must see, so I guess you will make the trip and see both. The aquarium near by",
          "We only had one day to visit Monaco as a day trip from Nice and it was pouring rain. Since walking around was out, a tour of Palais was a great choice. Given that this still a \"working building\" access is limited to one side, but what we saw was amazing. The English audio",
          "The tour of the palace was not guided. I received a free audio set for 30 stations after palace guards and security machine inspected my bag/purse. The stations were for various public rooms like the reception room, the throne room, a memorial bedroom for the Duke of York who",
          "Please be noticed that we only saw it from the outside--- The view from the hill and the way up are quite nice. The entire place looks neat and clean as is the entire state. Police presence everywhere which is not annoying at all. There is one police officer per 68 people which",
          "It is a beautiful palace worth seeing while in Monte Carlo. It is advisable to first buy the entry ticket. After security you are provided with audio guide. The photography is not allowed inside. Each room has got its own charm and history. The furniture and paintings are",
          "We had to wait in line in the hot sun for this. I have to say that I found it to be over-the-top ugly, with tons on gold leaf, room after oppressing room of it. There was a shockingly bad portrait of the royal family. I thought, \"You have got to be kidding.\" Then we went",
          "you should buy a ticket first and then stand in line. the line was fast and after 20 min. we went inside of palace. firs our bag was checked and then we got the audio guide. you can not take any picture inside the palace. there are many beautiful room with Complete explanations.",
          "The changing of the guard was a great experience. The Prince employs only people Monaco. Anyone in the employ of the Prince is except from taxes. The guards must retire by 55.",
          "The Palais du Prince is worth seeing if you are in Monaco. It's well organized and well curated and you learn a little bit of Monaco's interesting history, but really it's not all that exciting and probably doesn't need to be done twice.",
          "Nice walk all the way up to the castle, with beautiful scenery all around. The change of the guards is a must see as well, I think it's about 11:30-12 noon.",
          "Nice to see but not really worth the entry fee and you are not allowed to take any photos which is a shame.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the palace. Be sure to rent the tour cassette because it provides you with an in depth analysis of the palace, the furniture and the architecture. There's so much to see of the long history of the Grimaldis throughout the self guided tour. The",
          "Its an impressive and interesting place to visit. Crowds gather for changing of the guards, which is worth a watch if your in the area at the time. The square is surrounded by shop and a couple of narrow shop filled streets. Its a really nice walk down the coast line from here",
          "We walked up the the top of the rock to where this palace sits and there is an old town opposite great for a walk around the shops. We then saw a ticket office for the palace and as they were cheap we brought them to go in. The palace has lots and lots of history in there so",
          "Located in the old town up on 'The Rock', there is a steep climb or you can get the Hop-on Hop-off Tour bus. Entry costs \u20ac8 and there is an informative easy to use 45 minute audio guide available in a number of languages. You are not allowed to take photos and this is a shame",
          "We wanted to visit at least two sites on our day trip to Monaco. The Prince's Palace was the first and we were not disappointed. We arrived in time for the changing of the guard, just before noon. There were a lot of people for that and we thought the palace would be overrun by",
          "This is my favourite place in Monaco after yachts view there. Everything in the Palace is in a relation with a Grace Kelly, which is one of my favourite women in the whole world. There is many rooms, which everyone can see when you visit the palace.",
          "The views from the palace are absolutely stunning and worth the stair climb to take in the scenery. The palace was lovely and lavishly furnished my particular favourite was the Blue room. The walls are lined with a gorgeous blue silk, and matching upholstered furniture. Each",
          "It is worth the walk up the hill to see the Princes Palace and the shops around the palace area are great. The view over the Monaco harbour area is amazing and when we were visiting the yacht show was on and the buzz in the area is amazing. The ocean as far as you could see was",
          "If you go to Monaco, be sure to get to the palace for the 11:55am changing of the guard. This is only about 10-15 minutes. Take the palace tour while you are there. You see some beautiful rooms and learn more about the royal family. I enjoyed my visit to the palace.",
          "I visited during a trip with my husband and found this to be a must see. For a leisurely trip with a busy day ahead we decided to get the bus which was cheap \u20ac2 and easy. The numbers 1&2 run regularly. The changing of the guard really should be included in any trip up here. We",
          "another must go visit in monaco. I love the room s and the history gehind each of them. price is on the average of others atraction on europe.",
          "Stunning palace and simple but very enjoyable tour of the palace rooms etc. View from the top are wonderful and you also get to watch the changing of the guards. Entry to the palace in only 8 euros and has a good audio guided tour",
          "We enjoyed walking through the small portion of the palace that is open to the public. The headset audio was good. Disappointing that I couldn't take any pictures...",
          "if nothing else, for the view. the square in front is quite beautiful too. we missed the changing of the guard but heard that is fun.",
          "Lovely building surrounded by lots of old typically French buildings Nothing else much to see. Very touristy and crowded but better that Monte Carlo!",
          "A nice modern palace with beautiful wall-paintings, furniture and pictures, but one is not admitted to take pictures and the bigger part of the palace is not open to external visitors",
          "Palace look like out of a fairy tale. Necessarily see it . Tickets for apartments of the Palace can be taken from the pavilion against him.",
          "This is a very simple building, but stands out as a very clean building. We had explained to us where the Prince and his family live, as we were not allowed in.",
          "This prince's palace was so much better than I thought it would be. I love everything royalty, but I felt like they were so close to me when I toured this palace. It's down to earth, staff is friendly and not super busy. Lovely visit!",
          "A nice way to fill in an hour - an audio guide is a must. What awesome views too. 11.55 am to see the changing of the guards. We went by bus from Nice which was easy (bus 100)",
          "We had a lovely time at the palais; the rooms are stunning and the paintings gorgeous. However, there are no labels in English, and the audio guide did not give us much information on Monaco or the history of the principality or monarchy as we expected, but more a history of the",
          "It is a steep climb up to the palace that may affect someone that has breathing/walking problems but well worth the visit. There is a charge to visit. Although you are limited to what the palace can show it was still interesting to see how the royals live and that it was once",
          "I just wish we had more time as a group to actually go inside. From the outside it is very nice and it is a must see in Monaco.",
          "The palace is the private residence of the ruling Prince of Monaco, H.S.H. Prince Albert ll, and for \u20ac8 you can view the State Apartments. The Changing of the Guard is free and takes place at 11:55am. For the best view, line up as close as you can, facing the archway of the",
          "We bought tickets for the Palace and Car museum. Children 18 and under \u20ac5 each and adults\u20ac11.50 each. Quick turnover at box office and good service. Waited at front of queue to enter the Palace where we had to wait about 10 minutes to allow a large group of visitors in before",
          "I was somewhat annoyed having walked up the hill from Port Hercule to do the tour of the State rooms. On arrival I was promptly told to go to the ticket office which I did, when I returned a female staff member rather abruptly told me to stay still why she dealt with the person",
          "Visited the palace in August when on a cruise trip. You buy your entrance ticket at the gift shop opposite the palace and then queue to enter. We watched the changing of the guard ceremony first at 11.55am and then toured the palace. Interesting to compare the palace to British",
          "Built in 1191, this palace is the official residence of the Prince of Monaco. The palace acquired glamour in 1950s when famous Hollywood actress Grace Kelly married the prince and became chateline of the palace. The architecture of facade of the palace is as per renaissance",
          "Everything in Monaco for me seem all first class from place to place to visit so posh, so beautiful, mostly people so kind while driving, always give us a way to cross the road. I love whole Monaco.",
          "Very informative tour. Beautifully narrated. Would definitely recommend doing the tour while in Monaco.",
          "While visiting the aquarium they asked us if we wanted to visit it just adding 50 cents more. We accepted and the visit in this palace was great. A lot of things to see and the audio guide explain a lot of information. If you are lucky you can also see the change of the guard",
          "Only about 8 euros to tour the palace but well worth it. The audio tour takes you room by room and explains the history of the Palace. Not quite as spectacular as Versaille but great none the less. Also, the changing of the guard was cool. Again, not quite as majestic as in",
          "The Prince\u2019s Palace is the site where the Grimaldi family has ruled Monaco. The palace is the official private residence of the Prince of Monaco, Albert II. There is a legend that in 1297 Francois Grimaldi disguised himself as a monk and was admitted to the fortress. Once",
          "You have a great view of the city, you can actually imagine how they were defending themselves 2-3 hundreds years ago, i've been there on tine for the prince's guard changing (between 11:45-12:15 midday) and it was absolutely stunnig .",
          "If you have not visited Buckingham Palace and not seen Change of Guards then do not fret....this is almost close to it. There is a souvenir and ticket shop from where you need to buy the tickets. They have special deals like the palace with the oceanographic museum together or",
          "Lovely architecture and square (glad to get lost on way from train station to aquarium). Great view.",
          "It is a little bit different from other Palaces because is at the edge and in top of a hill but it is an nice one .",
          "When visiting the Place du Palais, it is worth waiting to observe the changing of the guard at mid-day.",
          "A real must plus very cheap to go inside such a rich and interesting palace. It was a joy. Look.out for the mirrored corridor was really funny.",
          "We both loved it. Good audio guide and whilst being informative it also keeps you moving. About 1 hour to do the whole palace and it is a good pace. Well worth the \u20ac8 euro. You can get combined tickets covering car museum and oceanography centre for only a few euro more.",
          "Worth the hike! You can do some people watching and of course very nice view from the top. However, i do not have a chance to go in.",
          "The palace is very beautiful with lots of furniture, paintings, etc in it. The audio guides are great and easy to use. Just choose your language when you get there. This palace brings you back in time. Very impressive!! We bought our ticket combined with a ticket to the Jacques",
          "The palace is extremely rich and beautiful. The audio guide is very useful. There is a room where Grace Kelly's wedding took place. But, it is not allowed to take photos inside. Changing of guards is very interesting. In terms of beauty this palace can be compared to royal",
          "Wonderful on top there great views over Monaco you must go get the bus the bus is good it takes you all over its so clean up there full history",
          "If you visit the Prince's Palace make sure you time your arrival around noon as the daily changing of the guard happens right at noon. Lots of pomp and pageantry & the price is right. It's free. Come early if you want a good vantage point as it does get busy during the summer",
          "Of course if you're passing through Monaco, you should stop at the Palace. We found a paid parking garage and brought along a picnic lunch. We walked up the hill (which was reasonable) and enjoyed the views the whole way! Once at the top, the view of the harbor is incredible.",
          "Allow up to 2 hours for visiting this beautiful palace. The ticket office is behind you as you look at the palace and there are various combination tickets available (e.g. combine with the Oceanagraphic Museum). If travelling together, one person stand in the queue whilst the",
          "Even if you don't go inside, it is worth a visit for its history, the dramatic view and many excellent photo opportunities: old cannons, view of harbor below. You can take the Little Train or walk up. The Palace is situated atop a cliff called the Rock. The area of Monaco has",
          "We were visiting Monte Carlo for the day so had to visit the palace. This was a really well maintained and informative tour, with audio guides explaining what you say in each room. It did not however go into the history as much as it could. This was a fortified palace for a long",
          "I've been to many palace and castles but the decor in this one was more modern and nice. The pictures of Princess Grace with her family were cool to see. No pictures allowed. Quick walk through.",
          "We visited the palace whilst on a day trip from our cruise, we walked from the aquarium up passed the park and cathedral to the princes place . The changing if the guard happens daily just before 12 noon, but get there earlier as the crowds gather in advance to watch this",
          "I entered on crutches with prepaid ticket and was faced with lots of stairs. No lift. Struggled up one level which caused a lot of pain and asked for a chair to sit on but they said none available. I was then given the option to leave and sit in garden. I asked for a cup of",
          "Easy to reach. Few steps from the city. Nearby church and can have a wonderful view of montecarlo. A statue of Francois Grimaldi just outside the palace . Interesting story behind it.",

          "Get there early.....very popular with tourists and locals. We hopped of the Hop On Hop Off tour bus to see this event and also to have lunch in one of the many restaurants closely. Don't miss it!",
          "This was a decent stop, but nothing too special. We did not pay to go inside, just took pictures from the square and explored a little bit in the neighborhoods across the square from the palace. Good 1-2 hour stop.",
          "Very nice place and a real must to be/see in Monaco. Not only it was worth watching the change of guards but it was so nice to visit the Palace. Before you enter make sure you swiched your camera/phone off, since taking ppictures inside is strictly forbbiden. The entrance is",
          "Really amazing palace that is still the Prince's residence (and for this reason the tour is a little short - the can't show you everything!). Beautifully maintained in styles of Monaco's history, and the audio guide is extremely informative, and included in the ticket price. It",
          "I really expected more than what was there, it was a simple tour with about 11 stations of information. Kind of sad really for a tour. Obviously a great looking place, but it's not why I came here. I had better experiences at the aquarium, and the church. Little historical",
          "This Palace is worth visiting - the Changing of the Guard at Noon is precision to watch but if you want to see the marchers fee, be there very early as very crowded even for May. As the area available in the Palace for public view is not large, it doesn't take that long to go",
          "Not too often do we get a chance to experience the changing of the guards these days. The quick ceremony is free and more intimate than Buckingham Palace. Make sure you arrive around 11:30 to position yourself to watch closeup. A quick and interesting experience. You get",
          "To be fair, we didn't go inside. From the description in combination of the ticket price, we didn't think it was worth it. But, we stuck around for the changing of the guard. It was great! Very professional and interesting. I loved the drummers and the trumpet player. You need",
          "After travelling along from Juan les Pins on the train, we spent a lovely day in Monaco and visited the Palais du Prince. You have three choices of tickets, we would have liked to have done the Palace and car collection but as it was around 4pm when we turned up there wouldn't",
          "It worth going to the Prince's Palace... it has a stunning view of Monaco and Monte Carlo. Take a walk around there and you'll love the buildings. We took a walk from the Casino Monte Carlo until the Palace and it's very close. I recommend!",
          "Free audio guide upon entry, gives explanation and history of Monaco and each room and its decorations. Security needs to check your bags and belongings. The line up for entry is a bit mixed up (individual and group - signs are unclear). You can purchase the ticket as a set with",

          "The changing of the guards (at 11:55am) is worthwhile if you're in the area at the time - but don't make a special effort. The whole fortress on the hill is really amazing and worth the steps - it's not that hard to walk up. The palace is a short 45 minute visit with an",
          "This is the official residence of the Prince of Monaco. Originally this was built to be a fortress. It dates back to 1191. It is protected by palace guards. It is a lovely building except for the part to the right that looks like it was added as an afterthought and in no way,",
          "monaco was our second port of call on our recent HAL cruise. although we had been here several times before, it was still an eye opening experience to see the massive yachts in the harbour, to visit princess grace's grave in the church and to see the changing of the palace guard",
          "What a beautiful building. Not expensive to view and all very interesting. You are given a headset to walk around with and that gives the important detail. Much smaller than I was expecting but still well worth a trip. Got there using the bus which you can get from outside the",
          "Went to Monaco to visit the pink Palace where Princess Grace and Prince Rainer lived. It was in a lovely setting with a nice little street off from the sq where you can eat and shop. You can have an audio guide which was very good and interesting as you go through the different",
          "Always wanted to travel to Monaco an see the palace. Monaco is such Beautiful city with stunning architecture. We walked up from the port. At 12 o'clock the bells ring and they changed the guards. They wear crisp white uniforms with old rifles. It was special to watch. Then we",
          "Once in South of France, this is a must see. A trip to monaco palace and monaco. Beautiful views. We drove up. It closes @ 6.00pm so it's quieter late afternoon. You can see the wealth in Monaco. It's all over the place. Will definitely go back again.",
          "I took the guided tour of the palace, which was beautiful and well maintained and very interesting. At the entrance to the palace you are provided with a headset and machine which takes you on a one hour long guided tour of the palace. At the end of the tour I handed in my",

          "Best time to see at Midday, during guard change. Nice to see the ceremony, you can take some pictures. Not far from there, the oceanograpich museum worth visit (14 euros, 7 for kids). A wonderful view for pictures from up there to see whole Monaco and french Riviera.",
          "the walk to the entrance of the palace was great and the palace was over all an impressive architecture, but its the nature view around which is more lovely. It needs to explored if you are in Monaco!",
          "After a fairly steep climb you are rewarded with a view of Royal guards and a bustling square with beautiful views. The palace is extremely well preserved. My favourite room is the Blue Room, which is used for state receptions. The colours and opulence are breathtaking. We spent",
          "The Prince's Palace is on the top of the rock (Le Rocher) based on the original fortification and still where the royalty of Monaco live. It is quite a steep walk or a quick taxi ride to the top where you will see what might be imagined as a palace exterior from a fairy tale",
          "If in Monaco I would definitely recommend a visit to the Prince's Palace. Great place to relax and take in the beautiful surroundings. A great place to capture the memories on camera.",
          "Very nice area and the view is gorgeous. A little bit expensive to buy suveenirs but definitely worths visiting.",
          "Monaco is one of my favourite places in Europe. It is a small principality and is full of so much character and heritage! Whenever we visit the France we go and spend a day there. The Prince's Palace is a beautiful place to see and walk around. The views from around the palace",
          "Great experience. A bit of a hike up to the palace but well worth it. We arrived just in time for the changing of the guard. Fabulous views from the top of the cliff. Explore the little side streets. We came across some lovely little cafes and restaurants. Took a long walk down",
          "We visited the Royal Palace on a combination ticket with the Oceanographic Museum, which offered good value (saving 3 euro). There are no photographs allowed in the Palace, although you can take pictures of the changing of the guard outside. We followed the audio tour through",
          "Beautiful Frescos, precious furniture, sculptures, china and impressive rooms full of art are waiting for a visit. The entrance fee can be combined with other museums to get a discount and is totally worth it. Good audio guide is for free in multiple languages. Visit the palace",
          "Took a quick self guided audio tour around the Prince's Palace and got a good history of the country and its royal family. Was a beautiful palace up on the highest rock by the harbor.",
          "You can enter the princes palace. The head phone are available in various languages, which gives you explanation of each room. some beautiful architecture inside. the prince has a very good arms collection, paintings, portrait,its a must visit while in Monaco.",
          "Very beautiful and interesting. With the audio guide, it was great to learn more about the palace and royal family's history. Better than other palaces in that this is still in use, although the Prince doesn't reside there, he lives just down the road by the aquarium. Changing",
          "You have to climb a slight hill to get up here but wow is the view worth it! We watched the changing of the guards, didnt go into the palace. Watched the vintage grand prix, payed in the playground and walked around the gardens behind and below. Beautiful spot. Nicest thing we",
          "Great tour with guided phone. The phone is used to explain each room in great detail. The palace is gorgeous on the inside and out.",
          "up a very long ramp. outstanding view. we wised up, though, and took the bus back down the hill, to catch our bus back to Nice.",
          "I came unknowingly on the day of the grand prix of the historical cars. Kind of cool but the whole city was overturned. If you can't get tickets for the tribunes or don't want to pay those prices you can watch part of the circuit from the palais square.With a good zoom you can",
          "This venue was included in our package tour of France and Monaco. The Cannes film festival as well as the Grand Prix were in progress which made the crowds and traffic a challenge. Overall a worthwhile tourist destination.",
          "Either take a bus or taxi to get there and then walk back down the staircase (not by the roadway) for great views. The palace is interesting to see but not ornate and grand like you might imagine. Arrive at 11:45 to get ready for the changing of the guard at noon. Its quite a",
          "the apartments were opened and we were amazed to see them as they are still used by the grimaldi family. Everyone respects this location and it is amazingly quiet although there were some people. Everything is kept tidy and the collection/history you have during the visit simply",
          "We took the Number 2 bus up here when we came out of the railway station. We didn't see the changing of the guard so can't comment on that. It is a lovely palace and there is an abundance of restaurants up the side streets opposite.",
          "It's quite a walk up to the palace from the marina...be prepared to be seriously out of breath, especially if the weather is hot! It's well worth it though as the building is beautiful and there are some seriously stunning views to be seen.",
          "It is for the wealthy but they allow us to visit. We arrived by ship and I must say the port is amazing seen from the water. Also, so many huge yachts. We did enjoy walking the city and sensing how some people live. The Palace was lovely. Changing in the guard happens at 11:55",
          "Visited here on way to Monte Carlo. Great views from terraces nearby, and the guards uniforms must be seen. Best way is to park and walk to see this, as well as the rest of the old village. Pleasantly of shops and cafes around.",
          "Its worth the hike to see this palace. It is small compared to other palaces around Europe but dont expect huge things in Monaco. The view from the hill is breathtaking. Change of guards on the other hand is quite boring.",
          "Nothing to grand about this palace, but it still is a pretty unique experience. You can watch the guard march back in forth in front and enjoy a caf\u00e9 at a nearby shoppe. I'm conflicted on whether it was worth the long hike up, but the charming little side streets at the top made",
          "Have you been in palaces in france? If you have and expect the same you will be dissapointed. Not quite as the Versailles. Okay, the Princess might still live here. Still, the place is very small with just under 20 rooms opened to the crowds. Remember to buy ticket before",
          "One other place that you should visit for sure. You can reach it by foot, starting from the port.Do not miss it.",
          "The square is cool and some nice old cannons are on display, but the changing of the guards is not that spectacular and it's hard to see with all the Euro-tourists pushing past you. This isn't worth waiting for if you can get a cappuccino or something else to take a picture of",
          "The place has a rich history with an ancient architecture. the place is very clean and the view of the sea side is magnificent.",
          "Although we didnt enter in the Palace, the main square is great for sightseeing and amazing photographs. It is on the top of a hill, but is a very nice walk with beautiful views over the city :) Furthermore is on the way to see the exotic garden and the occeanographic museum.",
          "You do not get to see so many rooms but what you do see is worth the visit at only e8 wig audio guide. The paintings of the family were lovely to see especially those of Princess Grace. The rooms are in the usual French opulant style so much gilt and carvings. Tip get the bus",
          "All intentions of visiting the Palace. Could see it from down below... Finding it however was more trickier than I thought. After eventually finding this magnificent building I was in awe! I even got to witness the changing of the guards... So much marching \ud83d\ude02 I now go up to the",
          "From whatever I saw on land perspective, this was the highlight of my trip. Go on a sunny day, walk towards the Palace through Exotic Garden and then from Palace see fantastic views of Monaco and its port.",
          "We arrived and at the palace and it was quite breath taking. I must say seeing this palace especially from the cliff side when you see it from behind is probably more breath taking than Buckingham Palace. From the main side of the place we could literally look over Monte Carlo",
          "We visited the palace and did the tour where you take a speaker that tells you about the history and rooms in the Palace. No photos can be taken in the building whilst on the tour and you will need to pack away your camera. Despite this, it is a tour that was very good to",
          "I didn't know you could visit some of the Palace rooms as I only usually watch the changing of the guard so it was a nice surprise to be able to get tickets and have a look around. We got headphones with a commentary in English for each room with descriptions and details about",
          "Visiting Monaco is visiting a place different of everything!So much wealth,so many Ferrari's , Rolls's,Bentley's,outstanding boats and yachts in the marina,it's indescritible!Really a place to visit, i loved it!",
          "What's the point in visiting Monaco if you don't view the palace close up. History buffs will love it. Culture buffs will love it and Americans should visit the former home of Princess Grace. It's stately but not overtly so and the architecture and views are very beautiful. I am",
          "The Principality of Monaco, the world's smallest country (next to Vatican City), has been ruled by the Grimaldi Family for over 700 years. Sited on the Rock, the oldest parts of this Grimaldi palace date from the 13 th century. We were advised to arrive early for our",
          "It's a beautiful palace. Very clean, crisp and modern in appearance. It sums up Monaco really. Effortlessly chic. The changing of the guards is a sight worth hanging around for. I've seen Prince Albert in the flesh driving out the palace so the royals don't mind having a",
          "I was disappointed in the Prince's Palace. I had hoped it was more medieval castle-like. It appears very modern, but worth the walk around and seeing all of the old cannon displays. From the Palace Square, you can see the changing of the guards, amazing views of Monaco harbor",
          "Monaco is small, so u can tour the city in a day, and when u have time, it's good to visit this palace and explore the area at the top.",
          "Watch the guards take turns. Lovely view from the palace to Monaco. Lovely streets around the palace to shop from. Choose a cafe to rest a bit after the long ascending.",
          "The views of Monaco are absolutely gorgeous from this spot. My family and I toured the wing of the Prince's Palace open to the public. The self-guided audio commentary was informative and insightful. Everything we saw, the rooms, the furniture and the artwork were remarkable.",
          "We enjoyed just seeing the palace, it is very beautiful. We were not able to get inside as we understood, it is only open to the public during the month or April. If you are in Monaco during that month I would think it would be well worth the time to take a tour.",
          "This was the number 1 place I wanted to visit in Monaco, unfortunately when I came it was closed. There was very little information available to say when they would open again other that \"February 2016\", well given that it was February when I attended then this was of no use!",
          "Our tour guide knew exactly the time of the changing of the guard, so it was worth waiting a bit and getting a good view point.",
          "The official residence of the Prince of Monaco built in 1191, the architecture, spectacular views, changing of the guard, good shops and cafes a very historic place. You can also walk up from La Condamine (central Monaco) to the Palace. (this is a bus stop when on the Le Grand",
          "This is a very beautiful palace and as seen as the royal family still live in part of it you are not allowed to take pictures. My boys might not have been enthralled but I really enjoyed looking around here.",
          "something on the cote d'azur which is actually free ! At 11:55 the changing of the guards is carried out diligently and professionally. A small crowd gathers to watch (sometimes a large crowd) and it is wonderful ! You'll have the finest views of the area from up there, take the",
          "Changing of the Guard takes place promptly at 11:55. However, about 10 minutes prior there was a small ceremony between the two guards at the entrance. Do not mistake this for the \"actual\" changing of the guards as some people did and they left prior to the main ceremony at",
          "If you want a good view of Monaco you must come here. The best way to get there would be to catch the Nice-Monaco-Menton 100 bus from the Nice port and hopping off at the Place d'Armes stop. From there it's a 15 minute medium incline walk to the top. Up there it looks pretty",
          "We went before Christmas day and the place was crowded. I think it's also because we were there before noon, before the changing of the guards. The Palace was really a great place to look at Monte Carlo below. A great Vantage point indeed. Walking up and down the hill was a",
          "We did not go inside the Prince's Palace. We just viewed it from the outside. We were fortunate enough to see it both by day and by night when it was beautifully illuminated. The Prince's Palace is the official residence of the Prince of Monaco. It was built in 1191 as a",
          "I climbed up to see the Palace on an overcast, and rainy day, however this did wonders for clearing away a lot of the crowd. I managed to get up right to the front row with no troubles, and got some ideal photos of the changing of the guard at 11:55, not as glitzy and glamorous",
          "Even though we visited in mid-December, this attraction was over-run with loads of tourists, both from the cruise ship in the harbour and from buses from Italy. Worth timing your visit to the changing of the guard (a low-key, brief ceremony), if you can see through the crowds.",
          "Beautiful Palace on top of the hill overlooking all of Monaco. Make sure you get there for 11 for the changing of the guards. Wear good walking shoes, it is quite expansive with the gardens and the paths back into the city.",
          "Its a very short tour and there is really nothing much to see. The whole of Monaco revolves around the Aura of Princess Grace Kelly. After seeing Versailles and Palaces in Austria this one is a big disappointment. Full tour is done in less than 1/2 hour. Not worth the Price.",
          "A nice ceremony outside the palace. Low key compared to similar European ceremonies but worth catching when in the area. A relaxed and friendly ceremony where you can stand next to the action. Good photo opportunity which gives a good clue to the pace of life.",
          "OK so there are only a few rooms open to the public compared to the size of the Palace, but it's important to remember it is still lived in. The little there is to see is to be fair, well presented. Inevitably, plenty of information with photos and paintings still prominent",
          "The whole tour takes just under an hour to visit 11 rooms. There's not much to see to be honest. The throne room and the Russian Tsar letters were the highlights. No photos allowed.",
          "As a big tourist attraction this site is VERY busy! There were queues of people waiting to take pictures in front of the wonderful views of the city down below. However, these were all quick moving and you expect a bit of a wait in something so popular! The views of the city"

        "wiki": "Monaco City (French: Monaco-Ville) is the southcentral ward in the Principality of Monaco. Located on a headland that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, it is nicknamed The Rock (French: Le Rocher). The name \"Monaco City\" is misleading: it is not itself a city, but a historical and statistical district. It holds most of the country's political and judicial institutions: the Prince's Palace, the town hall, the government, the National Council (parliament of Monaco), the Municipal Council, the courts and a prison (hanging on The Rock).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMonaco City is one of the four traditional quarters (French: quartiers) of Monaco; the others are La Condamine, Monte Carlo, and Fontvieille. It is located at 43\u00b044\u203215\u2033N 7\u00b024\u203255\u2033E and has an estimated population of 975.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco Ville was originally called in Greek Monoikos, after the temple of Hercules Monoikos, located in a Phocaean colony of the 6th century BCE. During its history, Monoikos changed hands numerous times. It became Monaco in the Middle Ages. Some of the city walls and original structures still remain.\nIt was here that the Phocaeans of Massalia (now Marseille) founded the colony of Mono\u00efkos in the 6th century BC. Monoikos was associated with Hercules, who was worshipped as Hercules Monoecus. According to the works of Hercules, but also according to Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo, the Greeks and the Ligurians reported that Hercules had passed through the region.\nOn 10 June 1215, a detachment of Ghibellines led by Fulco del Cassello began the construction of a fortress on the rock of Monaco in order to make it a strategic military position and a means of controlling the area.\nThey also established dwellings at the base of the Rock to support the garrisons. To attract the inhabitants of Genoa and the surrounding towns, they offered land and exempted newcomers from taxes.\nOn January 8, 1297, Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi, descendant of Otto Canella, consul of Genoa in 1133, took over the fortress. Although he had a small army, he disguised himself as a Franciscan monk to enter, before opening the gates to his soldiers. This episode gave rise to his nickname, Malizia (\"malice\"). This is why today the arms of Monaco bear two Franciscans armed with a sword.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nDespite being located in the middle of the City of Monaco, the world's most densely populated urban center, Monaco City remains a medieval village at heart, made up almost entirely of quiet pedestrian streets and marked by virtual silence after sundown. Though innumerable people visit Monaco City and the palace square, only local vehicles are allowed up to the Rock, and gasoline-powered motorcycles are prohibited after 10 pm.\n\nPrince's Palace of Monaco. The colorful changing of the guard occurs every day outside the Palais at 11:55 am.\nCathedral of Our Lady Immaculate (French: Cath\u00e9drale de Monaco), a Romanesque-Byzantine Catholic church that contains the remains of many members of Monaco's ruling family.\nThe Oceanographic Museum, established by Albert I, Prince of Monaco in 1910.\nChapel of Mercy, built in 1639, one of the oldest buildings in the principality. It is famous for being the starting point of a torchlit religious procession by local residents that takes place on the eve of Good Friday each year.\nSt Martin Gardens, a small park of rocky paths that cling to the rock.\nMuseum of the Chapel of Visitation, a 17th-century Roman Catholic chapel and art museum.\nFort Antoine Theatre, an amphitheater at the bottom of the rock.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMunicipality of Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Monaco-Ville at Wikimedia Commons",

Apart from no English or Russian (as we speak and understand) Thank you to French family who took our kids in front it them so we can be included. \nAngels look with devils minded people.",

The garden is 0.7 hectares in size, and features a stylised mountain, hill, waterfall, beach, brook, and a Zen garden for meditation. It is open daily from 9:00 to sunset.The garden was designed by Yasuo Beppu, the winner of the Flower Exhibition of Osaka 1990, as a miniature representation of Shintoist philosophy.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA detailed description of the Japanese Garden from JGarden",

Records show that the imperial palaces had gardens by the 5th century ce, their chief characteristic being a pond with an islet connected to the shore by bridges\u2014as is shown by later references to these precedents in Emperor Sh\u014dmu\u2019s (724\u2013756) three gardens in Nara. During the Heian period (794\u20131185), when the symmetrical shinden style of architecture prevailed, the main garden was laid out on the southern side of the house. With the change of domestic architecture in the Kamakura period (1192\u20131333), however, came modifications of the garden. Learned Zen priests, who assiduously studied the art of garden making, gave Buddhistic names to different rocks in the design and linked religio-philosophic principles with landscape lore. Other beliefs further complicated garden design. With the Muromachi period (1338\u20131573) came popularization of gardens, which were designed to be enjoyed not only as views to contemplate but as microcosms to explore. The subjective mood became dominant and the gardens reflected individuality. People demanded shibumi in their gardens\u2014an unassuming quality in which refinement underlies a commonplace appearance, perceptible only to a cultivated taste. Aesthetic priests, \u201ctea men,\u201d and connoisseurs created new forms of gardens for cha-shitsu, the little pavilions or rooms built for the chanoyu (tea ceremony), and a special style developed which revolutionized Japanese garden art.Garden of the Kinkaku Temple showing the use of a shelter structure, the Golden Pavilion, as the main focal point of a landscape design, 15th century, Ky\u014dto.Consulate General of Japan, New YorkPond and moss-covered bridge, Katsura Imperial Gardens, Ky\u014dto, Japan.William G. Froelich, Jr.The succeeding vogue of designing in three different degrees of elaboration\u2014shin, gyo, and so (\u201celaborate,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and \u201cabbreviated\u201d)\u2014was also adopted for gardens. Many splendid gardens were produced in the Momoyama (1574\u20131600) and Edo (1603\u20131867) periods. The centre of garden activity gradually shifted, however, from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo), seat of the Tokugawa shogun. At one stage there was a utilitarian development: a duck pond was added in the Hama detached palace in Tokyo and, in the Koraku-yen at Mito, space was made for the cultivation of reeds for arrow shafts and plums for military supplies. Feudal lords generally had fine gardens in their provincial homes as well. Quite a number of gardens survived the abolition of the feudal system after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, yet many celebrated gardens perished through neglect or were sacrificed to modern progress. The establishment of public parks, which were not unknown even in feudal times, was especially encouraged throughout Japan from 1873. Gardens in Western style came in with other Western modes but made little headway. The great earthquake and fire of 1923 demonstrated a utilitarian value of the Tokyo gardens: tens of thousands found safety in the parks and in large private gardens scattered throughout the city.Ritsurin Garden, Takamatsu, JapanCamera Tokyo Service ",

          "A small oasis in a very busy area. You can feel the calm atmosphere on entering this small, quiet garden. It is beautifully set out with walkways and small attractive bridges over ponds and rivers with large carp. A good place to visit for some peace and quiet.",
          "I did like the contrast between high buildings and green garden. But that's about it. Garden was still part of the city not a quiet oasis out of it, like I hoped. It's alright.",
          "once you are there you will feel the athmsphere, is a truly jump in Japan and kids will love to walk over bridges and watch fishes and seat in the pagodas... I love this place",
          "Monaco have lot of beautiful gardens and Japanese garden just one . Not big but accurate. Maybe interesting for someone who prefer asiatic influence",
          "Monte Carlo is very crowded with buildings. Every square inch is built upon, going up 30, 40 storeys. There is very little grass or flowers. So to find a pretty garden, lovingly planned, beautifully maintained and a pleasure to stroll through. It encourages a meander.",

          "This is great escape from the hustle and bustle of Monte-Carlo. This was a fabulous find, beautiful gardens with stunning water features and Koi Carp. It's a nice peaceful location and when we were it wasn't over populated with tourists. This is a free attraction and there",
          "It should be said at the outset that we like Japanese gardens, and have cultivated one in the past, so it's no surprise that we travelled from Nice to visit here. We were not disappointed as the level of maintenance is exceptional; Japanese gardens can be very high maintenance",
          "We enjoyed the garden, there's a free toilet, it's small and doesn't take long to visit. If you're nearby, it's definitely worth a visit.",

          "The Japanese Gardens are pretty but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has to travel far to visit. It's very small and no dogs are allowed, which is a bit sad as there are very few places to enjoy nature with your dog in Monaco and it seems pointless as most dogs in MC are",
          "Centrally situated, you may run into the Japanese Gardens whilst on a stroll in Monaco. It is quite small but when you consider how Monaco is half the size of the Golden Gate park, it gets a pass for not being as enchanting as the Japanese gardens in San Francisco. Still yet,",

          "If you're doing a walkabout like we were, then this is a great place to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet. If you're driving, then the parking cost is not worth this only attraction in the area.",

          "While it was nice to walk around this garden on a hot afternoon in June, I would not categorize it as a \"must see\" as some guides advertised. I much preferred the Saint-Martin Gardens on the other side of the harbor.",

          "Although a popular and free attraction, we stumbled on this which made it all the more enjoyable. We visited in April so all the blossom out, but beautiful tea house and desert garden, koi ponds and belvedere made this as complete a Japanese experience as you will get outside",

          "I have lived in Japan for 20 years so I could be very critical of esthetic aspects and comment about if is genuine or not but I won't. They have gone to lot of effort to make this a very pleasant and relaxing place to be. Monaco is becoming a wall of high rise apartments",
          "These are tiny but beautiful Japanese gardens located in Larvotto. There are trees, fishes and ponds.",
          "Although the gardens are very pretty and tranquil you probably only need 30 minutes at the most. It is on the coast line so would be good as a shady place in the height of the season",

          "This is green and quite haven to visit when you quickly want to get away from the buzzing around in busy Monaco. Not that big and easy walkable park which is well kept. I really enjoyed walking around.",
          "This is a great space but tiny so do not set aside time for this as could walk around it in 10- 15 minutes if read all signs or 3 minutes if just walk around or through it, hence reason why say don't blink or you would miss it.",

          "I loved this, I set out to find this little slice of heaven. Almost did not find it, but with the help of other TA I knew where to look. Monte Carlo has gardens all over the town, it is amazing how this can be free. I have a mini Japanese garden & inspired me to add onto it.",
          "Having read so many good reviews for the garden I was disappointed with the actual visit.. it's really small and nothing major at all.. I wouldn't recommend taking trouble to visit this place unless it falls on the route and you have a couple of minutes to spare.. Having said",

          "Great garden in the middle of the city. Cool place to rest while walking around the city. Very tranquil and claiming right in the middle of this crazy town. Sit and have a sandwich you bought at supermarket if you don't want to pay too much for lunch.",
          "This garden was inaugurated by Princess Grace (Kelly) and has been perfectly maintained and cultivated. If I had to visit one thing in Monaco again it would be this place. I've been to major Japanese gardens in other cities and this is rather small but is very well done and",

          "Not very big but worth a look.. It won;t take long to walk around if you just want a quick visit or you could spend a could of horus here and have a picnic in the beautiful surroundings. It has a waterfall, ponds with fish and array of beuatiful plants. plus it's all free.",
          "I visited in march and a lot of the water fountains and waterfalls were not operational. The area is smaller than expected but very peaceful. If you are in the area it is worth passing through but i would not make a special trip to get there.",
          "When walking around Monaco I though that I had missed this, much to my delight I then stumbled across it and I was so glad I did. This is a tranquil (for Monaco) place to come and relax and enjoy the well kept gardens. Well worth a visit.",

          "Very nice and cosy garden for 20 minutes of walk, really a piece of Asia on a French shore. Worth to visit a get a photo)",
          "Designed upon a wish from Princess Grace, this small Japanese garden keeps its promises when it comes to the design and the way trees are nicely maintained. It is just hard to abstract the noise from the traffic though. But let's hope that one day, the riches who live around",

          "On the way out to Larvotto Beach, by the Grimaldi Forum and art galeries, thisi s a beautiful little garden. Free access, benches on which to sit and admire some lovely planting or admire the koi gently circling in the pool- (helpfully they even placed a board for people to",

          "Can visit it if you really have time. If you don't you wont miss much. It is really not in a very good condition. Upkeep needs tiding.",
          "This botanical attraction has all the features of a Japanese garden albeit on a relatively small scale given that space is rare and very expensive in Monaco. The location is off the popular tourist path and would give pleasure only to those who love nature. Certainly not a",

          "Rushing back from the centre of Monte Carlo and walking through the famous Formula One tunnel, to our surprise we literally stumbled upon the Japanese garden. It is extremely beautiful with fantastic bonsai trees and ponds full of exotic fish. Definitely a must to visit.",
          "The Japanese Gardens in Monaco are a bit surreal in the context of the extravagance of Monaco. They're an oasis of peace right on the edge of the bustle of the town. The gardens use many trees and plants that would not normally be associated with a Japanese Garden but they",
          "The gardens are free to visit. It is very surprising to see this amount of space devoted to a garden in a prime section of the principality. It was a delight to walk through. There are entrances on both the east and west sides.",

          "We found these very difficult to locate but they are on the Monte Carlo side right next to the sea. There were no signs near the old town or port but we walked through the tunnel from the port to Monte Carlo and they were just at the exit to the tunnel. Peaceful,stunning,",

          "This garden is located in Monte-Carlo, Monaco. Very quiet and calm place. There are some small fountains also. Very near to sea beach, hotels, restaurant. Though very small, it is well decorated with a small creek and Japanese species of fishes. There are some Japanese trees",

          "In walking distance from the Fairmont Hotel or just next to several busstops one can find a tiny but very nice Japenese garden. One does not need more than 30 minutes to walk around and to see the garden, however the beauty are the few benches which offer a nice spot for a rest.",

          "it was very quiet and a great place to sit and relax away from the beach. Loved the garden and the pond",
          "As lots of other people has said this place seems rather at odds with it's setting just a stone's throw for the marina full of yachts and the F1 track! The tranquility and peace of this place is great and worth the effort to find as things ate not well signposted in Monaco, but",

          "If there is one, I always try to visit Japanese Gardens during my trips. If you'd like spend some time out of the casinos, this garden is an excellent choice. It is relatively small but you can experience a Japanese Garden soul here. It is ideal to sit under a tree and relax",
          "What a gem! Away from all the glitz and glamour of the Casino, there is a connection to nature here. It is off the main path a little but definitely worth a detour. For a city that charges an entrance fee to their casino, this is actually a free attraction.",
          "It seems quiet out of place in Monaco a small quiet garden but we were walking along the sea and came across it. Extremely well maintained and a tranquil hide away.",

          "Unfortuneately, you cannot bring food in, or it would have been perfect for a picnic...but the Janapanese Gardens are a haven of peace and tranquility. The best way to get to them, is to get on the hop on hop off bus as they are an official stop. They are just so beautiful, it'd",

          "The first and only good surprise I had in Monte Carlo... This garden is so \"not\" Monte Carlo... Quiet (even though you need to go to the sea side to escape the noise of the road on the other side), beautiful, spiritual, sophisticated, deep... Or just beautiful... Only place",
          "Very well kept , beautiful trees and flowers , amazing ponds and a girgeous little river flowing through beautiful stones",
          "We went to Monaco expecting to find an expensive concrete jungle. We found our way to the Japanese garden and were delighted to find a beautiful, wonderfully authentic oasis of calm. When you're shopped out visit here and relax in tranquil surroundings.",

          "It's a lovely place to visit when the sun is shining. So pretty and quaint. Lots to look at and lots of romantic photograph opportunities. Could happily go here every week as each time I go there's something new I spot. Fantastic",
          "Fabulous, this is a must. Not expensive and fabulous views. This is definite visit, the views from the top are amazing. You can see both Harbours from the top and from one side you can see the Monaco Football Stadium. You can also go down into the Caves which is approx 300",
          "Very pretty, but don't buy an ice cream and walk in...the guard will order you to leave! An amazing collection of plants to see, but don't touch!",
          "Stumbled across this beautiful little garden as we wandered around Monaco. This was so pretty and unbelievably, free! Only downside was no cafe! However well worth wandering through as part of a Monaco visit. Good location by the beach......",

          "Absolutely beautiful gardens to walk around. Went there to have a look around Monaco and this was the best place that we went to. Lovely!",

          "this is a great place to walk around in. it is clean and well kept. the gardeners make a real effort. The signs on the trees are self explanatory. the little tea house, welcomes one to sit down and look around",
          "These garden were absolutely beautiful. Having been to Japan, and having Japanese family I can vouch for the authenticity of this place. There are lots of information cards for French speakers and children love to watch the koi carp in the lake. There is a souvenir stand nearby",
          "Magical space that will look much better in 100 years. It is strange to see a brand new landscape trying to be old traditional...Beautiful but not ancient, authentic but without the magic of age.",
          "Having been a fan of Grace Kelly, I made it a point to visit these lovingly-laid gardens and had quite a peaceful, charming time there. Talk of typical Japanese pavilions and Tea-house as well as picturesque bridges, pond and waterfalls; this garden has them all!!",

          "Very beautiful, quiet and peaceful, well kept. Liked the ambience, there was nothing we disliked. There was no one around when we visited in January and so was lovely to walk around",
          "A famous Japanese landscape-architect designed this enchanting garden, blessed by a Shinto High Priest. You will find here waterfalls and Japanese ponds, bamboo fences, a Tea house, stone lanterns, tiles and wooden gates, all \u201cMade in Japan\u201d A very relaxing atmosphere, located",
          "Nice small park in Japanese style. Water cascades, colorful carps in the ponds and trimmed trees. The area is not too large but then what to expect since it's located in the country that is 2km long.",

          "Hard to believe that there could be such a gem in this tiny country. Free excess. Beautifully well kept, serene and tranquil. Huge koi in the ponds, old looking olive trees, pagodas?, zen sand boxes.... Only negative is if you have to use the facilities I would recommend to find",

          "It's difficult to see how it's possible to have an authentic Japanese garden without Acers, but the designer/s caught the atmosphere and that's what matters. It is free, calm and peaceful and, if you don't believe the picture displayed by the pond, there really is a blue(ish)",

        "wiki": "The Monte Carlo Casino, officially named Casino de Monte-Carlo, is a gambling and entertainment complex located in Monaco. It includes a casino, the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, and the office of Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo.The Casino de Monte-Carlo is owned and operated by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, a public company in which the Monaco government and the ruling royal family have a majority interest. The company also owns the principal hotels, sports clubs, foodservice establishments, and nightclubs throughout the Principality.\nThe citizens of Monaco are forbidden to enter the gaming rooms of the casino.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of opening a gambling casino in Monaco belongs to Princess Caroline, a shrewd, business-minded spouse of Prince Florestan I. Revenues from the proposed venture were supposed to save the House of Grimaldi from bankruptcy. The ruling family's persistent financial problems became especially acute after the loss of tax revenue from two breakaway towns, Menton and Roquebrune, which declared independence from Monaco in 1848 and refused to pay taxes on olive oil and fruit imposed by the Grimaldis.\nIn 1854, Charles, Florestan's son and future Prince of Monaco, recruited a team of Frenchmen\u2014writer Albert Aubert and businessman Napoleon Langlois\u2014to devise a development plan and write a prospectus to attract 4 million francs needed to build a spa for the treatment of various diseases, a gambling casino modeled from the Bad Homburg casino, and English-styled villas. Granted the concession of 30 years to operate a bathing establishment and gaming tables, Aubert and Langlois opened the first casino at 14 December 1856 in Villa Bellevu. Intended to be only a temporary location, the building was a modest mansion in La Condamine.\nIn the late 1850s, Monaco was an unlikely place for a resort to succeed. The lack of roads needed to connect Monaco to Nice and the rest of Europe, and the absence of comfortable accommodations for visitors, as well as the concessionaires' failure to publicize the new resort, resulted in far fewer customers than was originally anticipated. Unable to raise the capital needed to operate the money-losing enterprise, Aubert and Langlois ceded their rights to Frossard de Lilbonne, who in turn passed it to Pierre Auguste Daval in 1857.\n\nDuring this initial period, the casino had been moved several times, until it finally ended up in the area called Les Spelugues (English: The Caves). Construction at this site began on 13 May 1858 to designs of the Parisian architect Gobineau de la Bretonnerie and was completed in 1863. Gobineau de la Bretonnerie also designed the neighboring H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo (constructed in 1862).Although the casino began to make a profit in 1859, Daval was not up to the task. Just like his predecessors, he was incompetent and lacked the ability to bring the gambling enterprise to the scale envisioned by Princess Caroline. Frustrated, she dispatched her private secretary M. Eyneaud to Germany, hoping to recruit Fran\u00e7ois Blanc, a French entrepreneur and operator of the Bad Homburg casino. Blanc declined the offer. It took a lot of time and persuasion on the part of Princess Caroline to convince the Blancs to move to Monaco. Princess Caroline even appealed to Madame Blanc, whom she befriended during her first visit to Bad Homburg, with a suggestion that Monaco's mild climate would be good for Madame Blanc's ill health.\n\nFinally, in 1863 Fran\u00e7ois Blanc agreed to take over Monaco's casino business. To manage the new venture, a company\u2014the Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers\u2014was formed with capital of 15 million francs. Among the prominent investors were Charles-Bonaventure-Fran\u00e7ois Theuret, Bishop of Monaco, and Cardinal Pecci, the future Pope Leo XIII. Blanc became the single majority stockholder in the company and received a 50-year concession, which would last until 1913. Blanc used his connections to quickly raise the required capital, and began the massive construction. On Blanc's insistence, the Spelugues area where the gambling complex was located was renamed to make it sound more attractive to casino visitors. A few suggestions were considered, and the name Monte Carlo was chosen in Prince Charles' honor.\nIn 1878\u201379, the casino building was transformed and expanded to designs of Jules Dutrou (1819\u20131885) and Charles Garnier, the architect who had designed the Paris opera house now known as the Palais Garnier. Fran\u00e7ois Blanc knew Garnier because Blanc had provided a loan of at least 4.9 million gold francs to the cash-strapped government of the French Third Republic, so that the opera house, which had been started in 1861, could be completed. It had finally opened in 1875. The alterations to the Casino de Monte Carlo included the addition of a concert hall (designed by Garnier and later named the Salle Garnier), located on the side of the casino facing the sea, and the redesign and expansion of the gaming rooms and public spaces, mostly carried out by Dutrou on the side of the casino facing the Place du Casino, where the H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo and the  were also located.\n\nIn 1880\u201381, the casino was expanded again, to the east of Dutrou's Moorish Room, by the addition of the Trente-et-Quarante Gaming Room, also designed by Garnier. Subsequent additions and expansions, and the remodeling of the Trente-et-Quarante Gaming Room into the Salle des Am\u00e9ricains, have mostly obliterated Garnier's contributions to this part of the casino, except for some ceiling decorations.  In 1898\u201399, the Salle Garnier was remodeled by architect Henri Schmit, primarily in the stage area, so that it would be more suitable for opera and ballet performances. However, much of Garnier's original facade and the interior design of the auditorium itself remain intact. Despite all of the later additions and modifications, the casino still has a distinctly Beaux Arts style.\nThe most famous example of the gambler's fallacy occurred in a game of roulette at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in the summer of 1913, when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremely uncommon occurrence, although no more nor less common than any of the other 67,108,863 sequences of 26 red or black. Gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an \"imbalance\" in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by a long streak of red. In 1921, the first Women\u2019s Olympiad was held at the casino gardens. \nUntil recently, the Casino de Monte-Carlo has been the primary source of income for the House of Grimaldi and the Monaco economy.\n\n\n== Casino facilities ==\nThe casino has facilities to play a variety of games which include:\n\n\n=== Breaking the bank ===\nIn 1873, Joseph Jagger gained the casino great publicity by \"breaking the bank at Monte Carlo\" by discovering and capitalizing on a bias in one of the casino's roulette wheels. Technically, the bank in this sense was the money kept on the table by the croupier. According to an article in The Times in the late 19th century, it was thus possible to \"break the bank\" several times. The 1892 song \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\", made famous by Charles Coborn, was probably inspired by the exploits of Charles Wells, who \"broke the bank\" on many occasions on the first two of his three trips.\nAccording to the book Busting Vegas by Ben Mezrich, a team of blackjack players recruited from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by team-leader Victor Cassius and Semyon Dukach attempted to break the bank at Monte Carlo with the assistance of a team-play-based system. The book describes how the management of Monte Carlo responded to the success of the team. According to Semyon the account in Busting Vegas is accurate aside from the fact that the team was made up of himself, Andy Bloch and another player he refers to as \"Katie\".\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nJames Bond, a fictional British spy, is often associated with the Casino de Monte-Carlo.\nThe architecture of glamorous Belle \u00c9poque building of the Casino de Monte-Carlo was used by Ian Fleming to describe a casino in \"Royale-Les-Eaux\", a fictional resort featured in Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale (1953).\nMonaco and its casino were the locations for a number of James Bond movies, including Never Say Never Again and GoldenEye, as well as for the \"Casino Royale\" episode of the CBS's Climax! television show.\nThe casino served as a filming location for the 2004 film Ocean's Twelve.\nThe casino makes an appearance in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.\n\n\n== Other mentions ==\nThe Monte Carlo method, a computational approach which relies on repeated random sampling to solve difficult numerical problems, was named after the Casino de Monte-Carlo by physicist Nicholas Metropolis.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCasino Gardens and Terraces\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nBonillo, Jean-Lucien, et al.

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series. The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15-kilometre (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182-kilometre (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.Monaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping). In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25\u201327 June.\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three separate countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9-kilometre (1.2-mile) swim, 90-kilometre (56-mile) bike ride and 21.1-kilometre (13.1-mile) run.\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco. An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.A municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide. The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.With Formula One Monaco GP it has some supporter series, FIA Formula 2 and Porsche Supercup. It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and other Formula Junior programs. \nFrom 10\u201312 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.,The women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo. There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco, founded in 1994.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language school specializing in business education and operated by the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales (INSEEC) group of schools.\n\n\n== Flag ==\n\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs. Adopted by Monaco on April 4, 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (adopted by Indonesia in August 17, 1945) except for the ratio of height to width.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.\n\n\n== Relations with other countries ==\n\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentOfficial Government Portal\nOfficial website of the Prince's Palace of Monaco\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\nMonaco Statistics Pocket \u2013 Edition 2014General information\"Monaco\".

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series. The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15-kilometre (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182-kilometre (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.Monaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping). In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25\u201327 June.\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three separate countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9-kilometre (1.2-mile) swim, 90-kilometre (56-mile) bike ride and 21.1-kilometre (13.1-mile) run.\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco. An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.A municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide. The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.With Formula One Monaco GP it has some supporter series, FIA Formula 2 and Porsche Supercup. It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and other Formula Junior programs. \nFrom 10\u201312 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.,The women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo. There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco, founded in 1994.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language school specializing in business education and operated by the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales (INSEEC) group of schools.\n\n\n== Flag ==\n\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs. Adopted by Monaco on April 4, 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (adopted by Indonesia in August 17, 1945) except for the ratio of height to width.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.\n\n\n== Relations with other countries ==\n\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentOfficial Government Portal\nOfficial website of the Prince's Palace of Monaco\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\nMonaco Statistics Pocket \u2013 Edition 2014General information\"Monaco\".

          "We got access to the museum through the Monaco passport tourist package. The museum is really nice as they have many ships that you can tell took a while to make. They also have plane models. The museum itself is small but we were the only ones in there so we managed to enjoy it",
          "Lots of exhibits dating right back from the Greek Trireme to present day nuclear subs, with curiosities such as the innovative Turtle Ship along the way. The aircraft carriers proved a big hit with the kids, and there are lots of informative cards alongside each ship. Well",
          "You may as well stop whilst you are there. A great photo opportunity ! Amazing views if you can get there early to beat the crowd.",
          "Cost was \u20ac4. There was a gondola and a couple display torpedoes. The main displays were detailed large models of ships, submarines, airplanes related to service at sea. There were the battle cruisers, aircraft carriers, oil-replenishers, destroyers, torpedo boats, sailing",
          "This is definitely a place worth visiting. The variety in fauna and flora is amazing and you\u2019ll most likely learn a lot about the seas and its wildlife. The building is also very beautiful and features an awesome exposition.",
          "This place is amazingly beautiful. The museum is placed on a shoreside and has panoramic views. Don't miss their terrace and the fort type structure right next to the museum. There is a place to walk along the sea-line, which no one should miss.",
          "Professor Palanca has many ship models of all types from US Navy Aircraft Carriers, Cruisers, Battleships, Destroyers, Submarines, you name it he's got it. He even has a model of PT 109 that JFK Commanded in WWII. The USS Constitution as well. He has French, German, British",
          "I really wanted to see this place, although I had no idea what it was like. It was interesting. Monaco's naval history is a bit limited, so most of the model ships were American ships, followed by French, British and Russian/Soviet.",
          "Very pleasant representative at this tourist office. All questions, of which we had many were answered to our complete satisfaction. Taking the local bus was very easy and at two eurors a lot less expensive than the HOHO.",
          "Huge number of scale models in glass cabinets in a cramped space. There are some nice models and a complete reorganisation might actually turn it into a great museum. For now it's just a claustrophobic place where one can hardly turn or breathe. Such a pity.",
          "Lots of naval ships, mostly of US ships. Displays mostly behind plastic and very tight to move around. Maybe 1/2 hour to visit. With discount card, at \u20ac2.50 worth going to see.",
          "This is a wonderful place for exploration, education and adventure. The nearby road is an access to the courtyard of the castle.",
          "Wonderful setting, lovely relaxing time whilst getting to know new information about the sea, sailing and the animals around us. I even get to stroke a baby shark. :-) Super cool interactive games for kids or venturing adults, testing our knowledge and providing great laughter",
          "As another reviewer has noted, this should really be renamed \"Model ship\" museum as that's what 99% of the attraction consists of. That said, it was a pleasant enough way to spend an hour, and the models - not just of Naval ships but also including some cruise liners too - are",
          "Nice place with multiple models of ships very nicely preserved. One thing i noticed was the mismanagement thought. Visited in March (easter weekend). i had 3 passes for this place courtesy BA. The lone employee allowed me and my family with 2 swipes of the pass and kep the 3rd",
          "The model ships in thus attraction are brilliant, covering all types from prehistory to modern times. The rooms are small and cramped but very interesting",
          "We visited this museum with friends that live in Monaco. I have never seen so many models of so many different ships. We had the privilege of having the Director Professor Pallanca a tour director. Given that we are very interested in US Navy he made sure he pointed out the US",
          "Maybe it's unfair of me to rate this as average, as perhaps if you are really into model ships this would be great. I'm not and as I had just been in the Motor Museum salivating at the sight of 1960s Ferraris and 1920s Rolls Royces, it was a hard act for the Naval Museum to",
          "Firstly, let me just say that I had no idea what to expect from the Naval Museum as I had done no research, but I would have hoped that with a name like that, it would have more than just hand made model ships (in fact, it does - there is an underwater mine, a gondola and in the",

          "Visited as my fianc\u00e9 likes model boats. Good job, because that's all that's in there! All information is in French only, and the guy on reception who was building further models seemed almost annoyed we'd dared interrupt him to visit. Glad we had a free voucher as part of the",
          "Not really worth the entry fee in my opinion. It's not really properly curated. A couple of floors of fish tanks. Nothing memorable.",
          "Situated next to the car museum, the coin and stamp museum and animal gardens it was ideal to pop into as we sere there. Filled with beautiful models of ships from all ages of seafaring it was very interesting even though it wouldn't normally be something I would make a beeline",
          "The plastic and wooden models in glass cases were varied and extensive in number, particularly the aircraft carriers. But the space was squashed and felt quite oppressive after 20 minutes so I left. 19 minutes of listening to the one member of staff talking loudly to a",
          "I do not know what to sey. You just must to go there and see it. There is no picture or moovie which can show you hot amaising this place really is.",
          "If you are into marine artifacts/models you will enjoy this static collection of historical ships, artifacts, and pictures. There is a lot of stuff crammed into the these rooms. It is interesting but you have to appreciated the craftsmanship that went into making these models.",
          "It's a nice small museum filed with a lot of different scale replicas ships and vessels some small some large some huge but all with a lot of detail from small kayak like boats from Egypt to large modern U.S. War ships.",
          "This place is really bigger than you think - at least from the first impression you get at the small front. Thing is, it is about three rooms long and has a lot - and I really mean a lot - of model vessels / ships, but is not limited to this. You also get many submarines to look",
          "There are so many things to see and very special ones. I recommend this museum to everyone it is very interesting",
          "Came here on last day of a two week stay. Really good. So many models from ancient through to modern US air carriers. Models of legendary ships from history. Yes its lots of models, yes they are packed in but it's amazing. So much information. Loved the full sized gondola. Quiet",
          "Not very big place kids liked the models as there are many to look at so overall an interesting visit .",
          "Naval Museum of Monaco is all about ship models and I haven't seen that many anywhere else. You could find everything there from Columbus ships and ancient Chinese junk models to Russian cruisers from the 19th century till today to German WW2 Bismarck, Japanese Yamato, legendary",
          "We were disappointed as they were only models in glass boxes. Some were huge but they are crammed in and it is difficult to move around and some of the models are slicking out at eye level! Very nice models but not enough naval memorabilia.",
          "Comparing to other naval muesums this is a mile ahead. There are so many things to see and very special ones. I would recommend this museum to everyone."

One of the builders was Italian-born Jean-Baptiste Pastor. The church's dedication to Charles Borromeo highlighted the Borromeo family's historic ties to the Grimaldi family, the ruling family of Monaco. Bishop Charles Theuret of Monaco laid Saint-Charles's corner stone on November 11, 1879; it was completed and opened on Easter Monday, March 26, 1883, and subsequently declared a parish church on March 15, 1887.\n\nTheuret's successor, Bishop Jean-Charles Arnal of Curel dedicated the church in 1912. The church was restored and its facades renovated in its centenary year of 1983 by Prince Rainier III, he subsequently oversaw exterior renovation work at the church in 2003.The family memorial service for the entertainer Josephine Baker took place at Saint-Charles Church in 1975.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nTemplate:Monaco-church--stub",

        "wiki": "Albert II (Albert Alexandre Louis Pierre Grimaldi; born 14 March 1958) is the reigning Prince of Monaco and head of the princely house of Grimaldi. He is the son of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace, formerly Grace Kelly, the American actress. Prince Albert's sisters are Caroline, Princess of Hanover, and Princess St\u00e9phanie. In July 2011, Prince Albert married Charlene Wittstock.Prince Albert II is one of the wealthiest royals in the world, with assets valued at more than $1 billion, which include land in Monaco and France.  Prince Albert owns shares in the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which operates Monaco's casino and other entertainment properties in the principality.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAlbert was born in the Prince's Palace of Monaco. He has ancestry from Italy, Ireland, Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Mexico, Belgium, and Monaco and is American-Monegasque by birth; he renounced American citizenship in his early adulthood. He was baptized on 20 April 1958, by Monsignor Jean Delay, archbishop of Marseille, in the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Monaco, before being presented at the balcony of the Palace to the people of Monaco. His godmother was the Spanish queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain, and his godfather was Prince Louis de Polignac (1909\u20131996). Albert graduated with distinction from the Lyc\u00e9e Albert Premier, in 1976.\nHe was a camper and later a counselor for six summers at Camp Tecumseh, on Lake Winnipesaukee, Moultonborough, New Hampshire, in the 1970s. He spent a year training in various princely duties and enrolled at Amherst College, in western Massachusetts, in 1977 as Albert Grimaldi, studying political science, economics, music, and English literature; he also joined Chi Psi fraternity. He speaks French, English, German, and Italian.He spent mid-1979 touring Europe and the Middle East with the Amherst College Glee Club, and also undertook an exchange program with the University of Bristol, at the Alfred Marshall School of Economics and Management in 1979. He graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science.\nPrince Albert's mother died as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident in 1982. She was aged 52. In 2017, in In Depth interview with Graham Bensinger, the Prince stated that his mother's death was a traumatic event for him and the family. He also revealed that his father was \"never the same man\" after the loss.\n\n\n== Sports career ==\nAlbert was an enthusiastic sportsman, participating in cross country, javelin throwing, handball, judo, swimming, tennis, rowing, sailing, skiing, squash and fencing. He is a patron of Monaco's football team, AS Monaco.Albert competed in the bobsleigh at five consecutive Winter Olympics for Monaco, taking part in both the two-man and four-man events. In the two-man bobsleigh Albert finished 25th at the 1988 games in Calgary, 43rd at the 1992 games in Albertville, and 31st at the 2002 games. In the four-man bobsleigh Albert finished 27th in 1992, 26th at the 1994 games in Lillehammer, and 28th at both the 1998 games in Nagano and the 2002 games in Salt Lake City. Albert was Monaco's flag bearer at the 1988, 1994, and 1998 Winter Olympics. Albert has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1985, and his maternal grandfather, John B. Kelly Sr., and maternal uncle, John B. Kelly Jr., were both Olympic medalists in rowing. Albert has been the patron of the World Olympians Association since 2012. In 2017 Albert gained OLY post-nominal status under his competition name of Albert Grimaldi rather than his royal title.Albert took part in the 1985 Paris\u2013Dakar Rally, but did not finish it. He also became a judo black belt.\n\n\n== Accession ==\nOn 31 March 2005, following consultation with the Crown Council of Monaco, the Palais Princier announced that Albert would take over the duties of his father as regent since Rainier was no longer able to exercise his royal functions. On 6 April 2005, Rainier died and Albert succeeded him as Albert II.The first part of Prince Albert II's enthronement as ruler of the Principality was on 12 July 2005, after the end of the three-month mourning period for his father. A morning Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral presided over by the Archbishop of Monaco, the Most Reverend Bernard Barsi, formally marked the beginning of his reign. Afterward Albert II returned to the princely palace to host a garden party for 7,000 Mon\u00e9gasques born in the principality. In the courtyard, the Prince was presented with two keys of the city as a symbol of his investiture and he made a speech. The evening ended with a spectacular fireworks display on the waterfront.The second part of his investiture was on 19 November 2005. Albert was enthroned at Saint Nicholas Cathedral. His family was there in attendance, including his elder sister Princess Caroline with her husband Ernst, Prince of Hanover and three of her four children, Andrea, Pierre and Charlotte; as well as his younger sister Princess St\u00e9phanie, his paternal aunt Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy, his godson, Jean-L\u00e9onard Taubert-Natta de Massy, and his cousin Elisabeth-Anne de Massy. Royalty from 16 delegations were present for the festivities throughout the country. The evening ended with an opera performance in Monte Carlo.\n\n\n== Reign ==\n\nPrince Albert continues the policy \u2013 initiated by previous rulers of Monaco \u2013 of strengthening environmental awareness. In July 2005, just like his great-great-grandfather Albert I, he travelled to Spitsbergen. During this trip, he visited the glaciers Lillieh\u00f6\u00f6kbreen and Monacobreen. Prince Albert II also engaged in a Russian Arctic expedition, reaching the North Pole on Easter, 16 April 2006. As a result, he is the first incumbent head of state to have reached the North Pole.Prince Albert is the Vice-Chairman of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, an American charity founded in 1982, after his mother's death, which supports emerging artists in theatre, dance, and film, as Princess Grace did in her lifetime.In 2006, Prince Albert created the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, which continues the Principality of Monaco's commitment by supporting sustainable and ethical projects around the world. The foundation focus on three main challenges: climate change and renewable energy development; combating the loss of biodiversity; and water management (improving universal access to clean water). Albert is also a global adviser to Orphans International.\nOn 27 August 2015, Prince Albert apologized for Monaco's role in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighboring authorities women, men, and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and relationships ==\nPrior to Albert's marriage, there was much discussion of his continual bachelor status. Although he had received much press attention for dating well-known fashion models and actresses, his apparent disinclination to marry gave rise to rumours that he was homosexual. Prince Albert has consistently denied suggestions of homosexuality, most notably in a 1994 interview published in the French magazine Madame Figaro. \"At first it was amusing\", he said, \"but it becomes very irritating in the long term to hear people say that I am homosexual\".Albert is close friends with the artist Nall and owns some of his works.In October 2005, the German magazine Bunte reported that Prince Albert was dating Telma Ortiz Rocasolano, a sister-in-law of the Prince of Asturias (who is now the King of Spain). However, in November 2005, the Prince instructed his lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, to commence legal proceedings against the French newspaper France Dimanche for violation of privacy and false information regarding the story.\nIn 2016, Albert purchased his mother's childhood house in the East Falls district of Philadelphia. Upon acquiring Grace Kelly's childhood property, he stated the home might be used as a museum space or as offices for the family's Princess Grace Foundation. Although Prince Albert does not directly own the Prince's Palace, he does own \u2013 in addition to his mother's childhood home \u2013 personal homes in both La Turbie and Marchais.Prince Albert, a well-known automotive enthusiast, owns vehicles like the BMW Hydrogen 7, the Lexus LS 600h, the Lexus RX 400h, and the Toyota Prius PHV. He also owns a Dassault Aviation Falcon 7X, a 14-passenger leisure jet, currently stationed at Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport.\n\n\n=== Children out of wedlock ===\nIn 1992, an American woman, Tamara Rotolo, filed a paternity suit against the prince, claiming that he was the father of her daughter, whom she named Jazmin Grace Grimaldi. Prince Albert was also listed as the child's father on the Riverside County, California, birth certificate, according to The Desert Sun. The case went to trial in 1993 and was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Graham Anderson Cribbs, who refused jurisdiction and found that there was \"insufficient connection between [Prince] Albert and the State of California to justify hearing a suit [in California]\" and in doing so essentially accepted the submissions of the Prince's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, on that point. On 31 May 2006, after a DNA test confirmed the child's parentage, Prince Albert admitted, in a statement from his lawyer, that he is Jazmin's father. He also extended an invitation for the girl to study and live in Monaco.In May 2005, Nicole Coste, a former Air France flight attendant, originally from Togo, claimed that her youngest son, whom she named Alexandre Coste, was Prince Albert's son, and that this had been proven by DNA tests requested by the Monegasque government. She further claimed the prince had signed a notarised certificate confirming paternity but that she had not received a copy of it. The French weekly Paris Match published a ten-page interview with Coste and included photographs of the prince holding and feeding the child. Coste also told Paris Match that she was living in the prince's Paris apartment, and receiving an allowance from him while pretending to be the girlfriend of one of his friends in order to maintain privacy. She also said that the prince had last seen the boy in February 2005. The prince's lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, announced that as a result of the international publicity over the revelations of the prince's son, Prince Albert was suing the Daily Mail, Bunte, and Paris Match for delving too deeply into his private life. On 6 July 2005, a few days before he was enthroned on 12 July, Prince Albert officially confirmed via his lawyer Lacoste that the 22-month-old was his biological son.In an earlier paternity suit, Bea Fiedler, a German topless model whom the Daily Telegraph described as a \"sex-film star\", claimed her son Daniel was the prince's son. This suit was reportedly dismissed. A blood test, which was refused by the judge, did not prove that the prince was the father of Fiedler's son.\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\n\nPrince Albert and South African swimmer Charlene Wittstock were seen together from 10 February 2006, when Prince Albert was accompanied by Wittstock to the opening ceremony of the Torino Olympics. Their engagement was announced four days after they attended the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling in 2010. The wedding took place over two days: the civil marriage ceremony took place on 1 July 2011, followed by the religious ceremony on 2 July 2011.Prince Albert and Princess Charlene had twins, Princess Gabriella, Countess of Carlad\u00e8s, and Jacques, Hereditary Prince of Monaco, on 10 December 2014. Jacques is the heir apparent to the throne.\n\n\n=== Contraction of COVID-19 ===\nOn 19 March 2020, amid the large-scale outbreak of COVID-19, it was announced that Albert II had tested positive for the infectious disease, which is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. It was reported that he had begun to self-quarantine from within his apartment, performing his work and duties from there. This makes Albert II the first monarch and head of state to have contracted COVID-19. He is the second head of a royal house to contract the virus, after Karl von Habsburg. On 31 March, it was announced that he had made a full recovery and would begin to self-quarantine with his family.\n\n\n== Succession issues ==\nAs Rainier III's health declined, his son's lack of legitimate children became a matter of public and political concern owing to the legal and international consequences. Had Prince Albert succeeded his father and died without lawful heirs, it would have triggered Article 3 of the 1918 Franco-Monegasque Treaty, according to which the Principality of Monaco would become a protectorate of the French Republic. Prior to 2002, Monaco's constitution stipulated that only the last reigning prince's \"direct and legitimate\" descendants could inherit the crown.On 2 April 2002, Monaco promulgated Princely Law 1.249, which provides that if a reigning prince dies without surviving legitimate issue, the throne passes to his legitimate siblings and their legitimate descendants of both sexes, according to the principle of male-preference primogeniture. Following Albert's accession, this law took full effect in 2005 when ratified by France, pursuant to the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty regulating relations between the Principality and its neighbour. Prince Albert's sisters and their legitimate children thereby retained the right to inherit the Monegasque throne, which they would have otherwise lost upon the death of Prince Rainier.Under the current constitution, neither Jazmin, nor Alexandre, are in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne as they are not Prince Albert's legitimate children, and he emphasised their ineligibility to inherit the throne in statements confirming his paternity. Monegasque law stipulates that any non-adulterine illegitimate child is legitimised by the eventual marriage of his/her parents, thereupon obtaining the rights to which that child would have been entitled if born in lawful marriage. Thus Alexandre would have become Monaco's heir apparent under current law if Albert were to marry his son's mother. But in a 2005 exchange with American reporter Larry King, Albert stated that this would not happen.Prior to the birth of Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques, Prince Albert's elder sister, Caroline, Princess of Hanover, was heir presumptive and, according to the Grimaldi house law, bore the traditional title of Hereditary Princess of Monaco. Following their birth, she is now third in line.\n\n\n== Environmental issues ==\n\n\n=== Year of the Dolphin ===\nThe year 2007 was declared as (International) Year of the Dolphin by the United Nations and United Nations Environment Programme.  Prince Albert served as the International Patron of the \"Year of the Dolphin\", saying \"The Year of the Dolphin gives me the opportunity to renew my firm commitment towards protecting marine biodiversity. With this strong initiative we can make a difference to save these fascinating marine mammals from the brink of extinction.\"\n\n\n=== Jardin Animalier ===\nThe Zoological Garden of Monaco (Jardin Animalier) was founded by Prince Rainier in 1954. Rainier was petitioned unsuccessfully for many years by Virginia McKenna, founder of the Born Free Foundation, to release a pair of leopards at the zoo. Prince Albert met McKenna after his accession to the throne, and agreed to release the leopards as well the zoo's hippo and camel. He intends to convert the Jardin into a zoo for children.\n\n\n=== Expedition to Antarctica ===\nIn January 2009, Prince Albert left for a month-long expedition to Antarctica, where he visited 26 scientific outposts and met with climate-change experts in an attempt to learn more about the impact of global warming on the continent. During the trip he stopped at the South Pole, making him the only incumbent head of state to have visited both poles.\n\n\n=== CITES and bluefin tuna ===\n\nIn June 2009, Prince Albert co-authored an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal with Charles Clover, the author of The End of the Line, a book about overfishing and ocean conservation issues that had recently been made into a documentary by Rupert Murray. In the piece, Prince Albert and Clover note that bluefin tuna has been severely overfished in the Mediterranean, and decry the common European Union practice of awarding inflated quotas to bluefin fleets. Albert also announced that Monaco would seek to award endangered species status to the Mediterranean bluefin Thunnus thynnus, (also called the Northern bluefin) under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). If upheld by the voting CITES delegates, this proposal would effectively ban the international trade in Mediterranean bluefin. This was the first time a nation had called for the inclusion of Mediterranean bluefin under CITES since Sweden at the 1992 CITES Conference, which was vehemently opposed by Japan who eventually threatened retaliation through trade barriers. Sweden withdrew its proposal.\nOn 16 July 2009, France declared that it too would seek to have Mediterranean bluefin listed as an endangered species. Only hours later, the United Kingdom followed suit.\n\n\n=== Roger Revelle Prize ===\nOn 23 October 2009, Prince Albert was awarded the Roger Revelle Prize for his efforts to protect the environment and to promote scientific research. This award was given to Prince Albert by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. Prince Albert is the second recipient of this prize.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1996, Prince Albert received the Eagle Award from the United States Sports Academy. The Eagle Award is the Academy's highest international honor and was awarded to Prince Albert for his significant contributions in promoting international harmony, peace and goodwill through the effective use of sport.In October 2017, Prince Albert received the Lowell Thomas Award from The Explorers Club, a non-profit group that promotes scientific exploration. The award is presented by the president of the club on special occasions to groups of outstanding explorers. The Club cited Prince Albert's dedication to the protection of the environment, and that he was the first head of state to reach both the North and South poles.Prince of Monaco Albert II.  on 14 October 2019 at the Comenius University in Bratislava, he received the honorary title \"doctor honoris causa\" for activities in the field of protection of natural and cultural heritage and in removing the consequences of climate change.\n\n\n== Commemorative coins ==\nAs Monaco's head of state, Prince Albert II is depicted on coins, including collectors' coins, with very rare exceptions. One of the most recent examples is the \u20ac5 silver Prince Albert II commemorative coin, the first commemorative coin with his effigy on it, minted in 2008. On the obverse, the prince is depicted in profile with his name on the top of the coin. On the reverse, the Grimaldi coat of arms appears; around it, the words \"Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco\" (Principality of Monaco) also appear along with the nominal monetary value of the coin.\n\n\n== Other roles ==\nPresident, Monaco Red Cross\nPresident, Comit\u00e9 Olympique Mon\u00e9gasque\nHonorary President, Association Mondiale des Amis de l'Enfance\nHonorary President, The Automobile Club de Monaco\nHonorary President, The Festival de T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Monte-Carlo\nHonorary President, Jumping International de Monte Carlo\nHonorary Board Member, International Paralympic Committee \nPatron, Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters\nPatron, Peace and Sport Organization\nSenator, Junior Chamber International\nTrustee, Al Oerter Foundation/Art of the Olympians\n\n\n== Titles, styles, honours and awards ==\n\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n14 March 1958 \u2013 6 April 2005: His Serene Highness The Hereditary Prince of Monaco, Marquis of Baux\n31 March 2005 \u2013 6 April 2005: His Serene Highness The Prince Regent of Monaco\n6 April 2005 \u2013 present: His Serene Highness The Sovereign Prince of MonacoAs the prince, his official shortened title is \"His Serene Highness Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco\";

          "I have visited the zoo in Monaco in summer 2020, it is the smallest zoo that I have ever seen in my life! But so nice and efficient replacement! There are the following animals: hippopotamus, hogs, monkeys, parrots, flamingo, snakes, tarantulas, lambs and many others. So will be sure that you will not regret about visit!",
          "Worth visiting. The hippopotamus, birds, animals are lovely.",
          "Very excited about this place! Parrots are very friendly, as wall as monkeys!",
          "My kids love it. They are able to move around freely and independently. That's the fun of having a small but really well equipped and organised animal garden. The kids love the little play area too. Best point, animals have not been taken \u2026",
          "Great green space in Monaco.\nKids don't pay... Great to scape a bit of the day to day office",
          "Small size but great experience. Educational and fun!",
          "Lots of animals to see and amazing value for money",

          "A friendly place which combines nice surroundings and views, two small playgrounds, proper toilet facilities and of course a bunch of animals. Do not expect large animals (except for a hippo), but there is a good variety. 50ct pieces will buy you bird feed etc.",
          "I don't approve of zoos, but this place looked cute. They had a Zoboomafoo here. Lots of animals that I hope are well taken care of. Prices are 5\u20ac for adults and 2\u20ac50 for children. You can also couple this ticket with a ticket for the car museum and probably with the palace or aquarium as well. Small, but worth a stop if you like zoos.",
          "This is a great place and entry is cheap.\nThe animals seem to be happy.\nThe lady on the desk did not utter one word!. What I did find concerning was the amount of rats running around in daylight!. These are nocturnal creatures and it shows \u2026",
          "Very reasonable price to see such beautiful creatures on with an amazing view. It won't take you more than an hour to get through but your great will melt at some of the more furry creatures and even some of the more scaly ones. Totally recommended, one start off only due to the hippo enclosure looking all too small for this beast.",
          "Very nice place very quite and calm.\nIt's not crowded. \nEntry is not expensive.",
          "Very small and nice",
          "Nice animal garden. Many renovations were taking place, but still many animals to see. Great place to go with kids, as chicken and other animals run freely in the park, making for a lot of emotional screams:-)",
          "Depressing experience. Poorly kept zoo and cramped up animals. Animals have not been cleaned. Have been to better zoos in India. Trivandrum zoo for e.g.",
          "Little animal park downtown with a nice range of species from snakes, birds, monkeys to hippo. A few can be fed directly, which adds to the fun kids have there.",
          "I went there this summer. There were animals standing in the heat with no water. I will never visit this zoo again. It was a depressing experience. I expected something completely different.",
          "I Love this peaceful place. So view is so nice. It s just a bit expensive but it s Monaco.",
          "Excellent variety of animals in a small zoo",
          "Hidden little treasures in Monaco. Very good place for kids.",
          "CRUEL!!!!! Poor hippo at this zoo had no room to move! Sun beating down on its back day in day out!! Only way I can describe it is to imagen a severely overweight man stuck in a bath tub.\n\nThis should NOT be allowed!! why is this poor animals life less important then ours.\n\nDon't visit here this zoo should be closed down. ",
          "What a depressing place. So many cramped cages, and tired looking animals. This has put me, my wife, and our young son off zoos for life.",

          "As far as zoos go, it's a bit small, but there's a wide range of animal including a hippo and some kangaroos. Each animal has plenty space to live in and the place is pretty well kept. Go in the afternoon, since the zoo doesn't get any sunlight in the morning. The chickens",

        "wiki": "Monaco City (French: Monaco-Ville) is the southcentral ward in the Principality of Monaco. Located on a headland that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, it is nicknamed The Rock (French: Le Rocher). The name \"Monaco City\" is misleading: it is not itself a city, but a historical and statistical district. It holds most of the country's political and judicial institutions: the Prince's Palace, the town hall, the government, the National Council (parliament of Monaco), the Municipal Council, the courts and a prison (hanging on The Rock).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMonaco City is one of the four traditional quarters (French: quartiers) of Monaco; the others are La Condamine, Monte Carlo, and Fontvieille. It is located at 43\u00b044\u203215\u2033N 7\u00b024\u203255\u2033E and has an estimated population of 975.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco Ville was originally called in Greek Monoikos, after the temple of Hercules Monoikos, located in a Phocaean colony of the 6th century BCE. During its history, Monoikos changed hands numerous times. It became Monaco in the Middle Ages. Some of the city walls and original structures still remain.\nIt was here that the Phocaeans of Massalia (now Marseille) founded the colony of Mono\u00efkos in the 6th century BC. Monoikos was associated with Hercules, who was worshipped as Hercules Monoecus. According to the works of Hercules, but also according to Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo, the Greeks and the Ligurians reported that Hercules had passed through the region.\nOn 10 June 1215, a detachment of Ghibellines led by Fulco del Cassello began the construction of a fortress on the rock of Monaco in order to make it a strategic military position and a means of controlling the area.\nThey also established dwellings at the base of the Rock to support the garrisons. To attract the inhabitants of Genoa and the surrounding towns, they offered land and exempted newcomers from taxes.\nOn January 8, 1297, Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi, descendant of Otto Canella, consul of Genoa in 1133, took over the fortress. Although he had a small army, he disguised himself as a Franciscan monk to enter, before opening the gates to his soldiers. This episode gave rise to his nickname, Malizia (\"malice\"). This is why today the arms of Monaco bear two Franciscans armed with a sword.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nDespite being located in the middle of the City of Monaco, the world's most densely populated urban center, Monaco City remains a medieval village at heart, made up almost entirely of quiet pedestrian streets and marked by virtual silence after sundown. Though innumerable people visit Monaco City and the palace square, only local vehicles are allowed up to the Rock, and gasoline-powered motorcycles are prohibited after 10 pm.\n\nPrince's Palace of Monaco. The colorful changing of the guard occurs every day outside the Palais at 11:55 am.\nCathedral of Our Lady Immaculate (French: Cath\u00e9drale de Monaco), a Romanesque-Byzantine Catholic church that contains the remains of many members of Monaco's ruling family.\nThe Oceanographic Museum, established by Albert I, Prince of Monaco in 1910.\nChapel of Mercy, built in 1639, one of the oldest buildings in the principality. It is famous for being the starting point of a torchlit religious procession by local residents that takes place on the eve of Good Friday each year.\nSt Martin Gardens, a small park of rocky paths that cling to the rock.\nMuseum of the Chapel of Visitation, a 17th-century Roman Catholic chapel and art museum.\nFort Antoine Theatre, an amphitheater at the bottom of the rock.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMunicipality of Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Monaco-Ville at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Rainier III (Rainier Louis Henri Maxence Bertrand Grimaldi; 31 May 1923 \u2013 6 April 2005) was the Prince of Monaco from 1949 to his death in 2005. Rainier ruled the Principality of Monaco for almost 56 years, making him one of the longest ruling monarchs in European history. Though internationally known for his marriage to American actress Grace Kelly, he was also responsible for reforms to Monaco's constitution and for expanding the principality's economy from its traditional casino gambling base to its current tax haven role. Gambling accounts for only approximately three per cent of the nation's annual revenue today; when Rainier ascended the throne in 1949, it accounted for more than 95 per cent.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRainier was born at Prince's Palace in Monaco, the only son of Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois, and her husband, Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois. Rainier was the first native-born prince since Honor\u00e9 IV in 1758. Rainier's mother was the only child of Louis II, Prince of Monaco, and Marie Juliette Louvet; she was legitimised through formal adoption and subsequently named heir presumptive to the throne of Monaco. Rainier's father was a half-French, half-Mexican who adopted his wife's dynasty, Grimaldi, upon marriage and was made a Prince of Monaco by marriage by Prince Louis, his father-in-law. Rainier had one sibling, Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy.Rainier's early education was conducted in England, at the prestigious public schools of Summerfields in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, and later at Stowe, in Buckinghamshire. After England, Rainier attended the Institut Le Rosey in Rolle and Gstaad, Switzerland from 1939, before continuing to the University of Montpellier in France, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, and finally to the Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Paris in Paris.In 1944, upon his 21st birthday, Rainier's mother renounced her right to the Monegasque throne and Rainier became Prince Louis's direct heir. In World War II Rainier joined the Free French Army in September 1944, and serving under General de Monsabert as a second lieutenant, and seeing action during the German counter-offensive in Alsace. He received the French Croix de Guerre with bronze star (representing a brigade level citation) and was given the rank of Chevalier in the French Legion of Honor in 1947. Following his decommission from the French Army, he was promoted by the French government as a captain in April 1949 and a colonel in December 1954.In the 1940s and 1950s, Rainier had a ten-year relationship with the French film actress Gis\u00e8le Pascal, whom he had met while a student at Montpellier University, and the couple lived at Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. Rainier's sister, Princess Antoinette, wishing her own son to ascend the throne, spread rumours that Pascal was infertile. The rumours combined with a snobbery over Pascal's family origins ultimately ended the relationship.Rainier became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco on the death of Louis II on 9 May 1949.\n\n\n== Reign ==\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Rainier worked assiduously to recoup Monaco's lustre, which had become tarnished through neglect (especially financial) and scandal (his mother, Princess Charlotte, took a noted jewel thief known as Ren\u00e9 the Cane as her lover). According to numerous obituaries, the prince was faced upon his ascension with a treasury that was practically empty. The small nation's traditional gambling clientele, largely European aristocrats, found themselves with reduced funds after World War II. Other gambling centres had opened to compete with Monaco, many of them successfully. To compensate for this loss of income, Rainier decided to promote Monaco as a tax haven, commercial center, real-estate development opportunity, and international tourist attraction. The early years of his reign saw the overweening involvement of the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who took control of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer (SBM) and envisioned Monaco as solely a gambling resort. Prince Rainier regained control of SBM in 1964, effectively ensuring that his vision of Monaco would be implemented. In addition, the Societ\u00e9 Mon\u00e9gasque de Banques et de M\u00e9taux Pr\u00e9cieux, a bank which held a significant amount of Monaco's capital, was bankrupted by its investments in a media company in 1955, leading to the resignation of Monaco's cabinet.\nAs Prince of Monaco, Rainier was also responsible for the principality's new constitution in 1962 which significantly reduced the power of the sovereign. (He suspended the previous constitution in 1959, saying that it \"has hindered the administrative and political life of the country.\") The changes ended autocratic rule, placing power with the prince and a National Council of eighteen elected members.\nAt the time of his death, he was the world's second longest-serving living head of state (independent), just below the King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\n\n== Marriage and family ==\n\nAfter a year-long courtship described as containing \"a good deal of rational appraisal on both sides\" (The Times, 7 April 2005, page 59), Prince Rainier married Oscar-winning American actress Grace Kelly (1929\u20131982) in 1956. The ceremonies in Monaco were on 18 April 1956 (civil) and 19 April 1956 (religious). Their children are:\n\nPrincess Caroline, born 23 January 1957 and now the Princess of Hanover;\nPrince Albert II, born 14 March 1958, inherited the throne of Monaco;\nPrincess St\u00e9phanie, born 1 February 1965.In 1979, Prince Rainier made his acting debut alongside his wife Grace in a 33-minute independent film called Rearranged, produced in Monaco. According to co-star Edward Meeks, after premiering it in Monaco, Grace showed it to ABC TV executives in New York in 1982, who expressed interest if extra scenes were shot to make it an hour long. However, Grace died in a car crash caused by a stroke in 1982, making it impossible to expand the film for American release.Rainier then may have been romantically involved with his second cousin, Princess Ira von F\u00fcrstenberg, a former actress turned jewellery designer, who is also a Fiat heiress and the former sister-in-law of fashion designer Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg. Princess Ira, like him, is a great-grandchild of Lady Mary Victoria Hamilton, the Scottish-German wife of Prince Albert I of Monaco, though by Lady Mary's second marriage.\nAfter Grace's death, Rainier refused to remarry.\n\n\n== Philately ==\nRainier established a postal museum in 1950: the Museum of Stamps and Coins, in Monaco's Fontvieille district by using the collections of the Monegasque princes Albert I and Louis II. The prestigious philatelic collectors club Club de Monte-Carlo de l'\u00c9lite de la Philat\u00e9lie was established under his patronage in 1999; the club has its headquarters at the museum, with its membership restricted to institutions and one hundred prestigious collectors. Rainier organized exhibitions of rare and exceptional postage stamps and letters with the club's members. Throughout his reign, Rainier surveyed all the process of creation of Monaco stamps. He liked stamps printed in intaglio and the art of engravers Henri Cheffer and Czes\u0142aw S\u0142ania.\n\n\n== Car collection ==\nRainier's car collection was opened to the public as the Monaco Top Cars Collection in Fontvieille.\n\n\n== Illness and death ==\n\nPrince Rainier smoked 60 cigarettes a day. In the last years of his life his health progressively declined. He underwent surgery in late 1999 and 2000, and was hospitalized in November 2002 for a chest infection. He spent three weeks in hospital in January 2004 for what was described as general fatigue. In February 2004, he was hospitalized with a coronary lesion and a damaged blood vessel. In October he was again in hospital with a lung infection. In November of that year, Prince Albert appeared on CNN's Larry King Live and told Larry King that his father was fine, though he was suffering from bronchitis.On 7 March 2005, he was again hospitalized with a lung infection. Rainier was moved to the hospital's intensive care unit on 22 March. One day later, on 23 March, it was announced he was on a ventilator, suffering from renal and heart failure. On 26 March, the palace reported that despite intensive ongoing efforts to improve the prince's health, he was continuing to deteriorate; however, the following day, he was reported to be conscious, his heart and kidney conditions having stabilized. His prognosis remained \"very reserved\".On 31 March 2005, following consultation with the Crown Council of Monaco, the Palais Princier announced that Rainier's son, Hereditary Prince Albert, would take over the duties of his father as regent since Rainier was no longer able to exercise his royal functions.On 1 April 2005, the Palace announced that Rainier's doctors believe his chances of recovery were \"slim\". On 6 April, Prince Rainier died at the Cardiothoracic Centre of Monaco at 6:35 am local time at the age of 81. He was succeeded by his only son, who became Prince Albert II.He was buried on 15 April 2005 beside his wife, Princess Grace, at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate, the traditional burial place of princes and princesses of Monaco, and the place where Prince Rainier and Princess Grace had been married in 1956.Because his death occurred shortly after that of Pope John Paul II, Rainier's death was overshadowed in the media.\n\n\n== Titles, styles, honours and arms ==\n\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n\n31 May 1923 \u2013 2 June 1944: His Serene Highness Prince Rainier of Monaco\n2 June 1944 \u2013 9 May 1949: His Serene Highness The Hereditary Prince of Monaco\n9 May 1949 \u2013 6 April 2005: His Serene Highness Prince Rainier III, The Prince of Monaco\n\n\n=== Honours ===\nBelgium: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold I\nBelgium: Recipient of the War Cross Medal 1940\u20131945\nKingdom of Egypt Egyptian Royal Family: Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Royal Order of Muhammad Ali\nEl Salvador: Grand Cross of the Order of Jose Matias Delgado\nFrance: Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honour\nFrance: Recipient of the War Cross Medal 1939\u20131945, Bronze\nFrance: Recipient of the Volunteer Combatant Cross Medal 1939\u20131945\nFrance: Recipient of the Combatant Cross Medal\nFrance: Recipient of the 1939\u20131945 War Commemorative Medal\nKingdom of Greece Greek Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Redeemer\nKingdom of Greece Greek Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Order of Saints George and Constantine\nIran Iranian Imperial Family: Recipient of the Commemorative Medal of the 2,500-year Celebration of the Persian Empire\nItaly: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic\nItaly: Recipient of the War Merit Cross Medal\nHoly See: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Golden Spur\nSovereign Military Order of Malta: Bailiff Knight Grand Cross of Justice of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Special Class\nSovereign Military Order of Malta: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit\nLebanon: Recipient of the Medal of the Order of Merit\nNetherlands: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\nPanama: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Manuel Amador Guerrero\nPortugal: Grand Cross with Collar of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword\nRepublic of San Marino: Grand Cross of the Equestrian Order of Saint-Marin\nSweden: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Order of the Seraphim\nKingdom of Yugoslavia Yugoslavian Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Star of Kara\u0111or\u0111e\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nFrance:\nInternational Automobile Federation: Recipient of the Gold Medal for Motor Sport\nIOC International Olympic Committee: Recipient of the Gold Olympic Order\nUnited States:\nAmerican Legion: Recipient of the American Legion Gold Medal, 1st Class\n\n\n=== Ranks ===\nFrance:\nFrench Army\nColonel\n\n\n=== Arms and emblems ===\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPrince Rainier Day\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPrince's Palace, Monaco, official website\nCardinal Ratzinger sends condolences to Monaco on Prince Rainier's death\nThe Monte Carlo Royal Palace \u2013 360 degree QTVR\nPrince Rainier III of Monaco \u2013 Daily Telegraph obituary",

          "Being more of a motorbike man I was reluctant to visit another collection of cars but succumbed to pressure from my wife. I have to admit that this collection should not be missed, from the 2017 Bugatti Veyron at the entrance to the historic royal horse carriages this display",

          "I was hoping to take some photos of the classic supercars located in the collection. There were some amazing car legends such as a Ferrari F50, Mercedes 300SL Gullwing and Lamborghini Miura. To our surprise, we couldn\u2019t find the black LaFerrari and the SLR Stirling Moss. It\u2019s",
          "This place is absolutely worth a visit; you will be amazed by the huge collection of old cars (some of them very old dating back from 1904) and modern F1 cars. Price was also very reasonable(6 \u20ac per adult), so I would highly recommed it to anyone visiting Monaco.",

          "Had high hopes, and my son had been planning his visit for about a year. The one car he'd wanted to see - a rare Mercedes - was not there, despite appearing on the ticket. The display information was limited and unimaginative and the decor was dated, or absent altogether. In",

          "We had a joint ticket for both the Prices\u2019 Palais and the Cars, excellent value , but you had to go to them both in the same day. There were so many different cars from different eras from veteran cars of the late 19th century to modern luxury sports cars such Ferrari\u2019s . There",
          "On a day trip to Monaco, we took a trip to this marvellous automotive collection. It is so worthwhile whether you are a \u201cpetrolhead\u201d or not. The vehicles are stunning. Everything from 19th century horse drawn carriages to F1 cars. It is so easily laid out that you see everything",
          "The car collection was one of our favourite things we did on our trip. It costs about \u20ac6.50 for an adult, and you can spend as much or as little time as you like. We took almost an hour, but could have easily spent much longer. You can literally stand inches away from some of",
          "As others mentioned, it's a good deal to buy a combined ticket for the car collection and the palace. We spent over an hour and a half wandering around the three floors of collections. There is a placard providing car make and year but would have enjoyed much more information",
          "I bought a combination ticket to the palace and car collection and was glad I did. This fascinating collection of cars extends from the earliest days of automobiles (including an early motorcycle) right up to modern race cars. The cars are beautifully presented and maintained.",
          "Amazed by the size and quality of the collection and we both enjoyed it very much. It would be helpful to have some more info about each car rather than just the model and year. Though Luckily my hubby knows quite a bit about cars and managed to talk me through.",
          "An impressive and extensive collection of cars, a notice inside tells you that it is not a museum, just a private collection which happens to be on display. Well, it\u2019s certainly some private collection! The entrance price is a very reasonable \u20ac6 or so, or even less if combined",

Even if you are not into your cars this is still a worth while collection to see. Takes less than an hour to walk around and then the usual gift shop",
          "This is definitely a must see while in Monte Carlo. Though you could easily walk past it. Entry isn't expensive either and it takes about half hour to get around.",

          "If you are a car enthusiast you must pay a visit to this museum. It has some amazing vehicles. in my opinion to many large old cars from the 20's and 30's but this is because my favourites are more towards the 50's. Some F1, few rally cars but some amazing units, like a Ferrari",

          "My wife's dad is a huge fan of classical cars, so we thought we would come here to take photos for him. This place may be difficult to find though, as it's away from the main town area and the stairs to the entry point can be difficult to locate, but it's worth the effort. For",
          "Very nice place to visit, there aren't too many attractions and things to see in Monaco as it is more of a relaxing beach type holiday. The collection is fairly big and the entree fee is pretty decent, being students we only had to pay a reduced fee of \u20ac5.",

          "Strange location, somehow a bit hard to find if one is not used to the labyrinth of elevators and underground passages. Looks like a converted garage, there are still some dishes embedded in the floor to turn cars a 180\u00b0. Several rare models or brands that have disappeared over",
          "The Private Collection of cars, posters and more is well worth a visit! Although not billed as a museum, the descriptions were more than enough and many of the vehicles have history with the Grand Prix and Monaco royalty.",

          "The easiest way for us to reach the location was through the underpass at the main train station. Doesn't seem much from the outside, but its a really large collection of automobiles - from horse drawn carriages to cars built anywhere from pre WWI to more modern classics. It was",

          "Collection is not huge but includes many interesting pieces from racetracks and automotive history. Can be scanned through in less than an hour. Rest of the family can visit the shopping center as car fans check this one out. There's also a nice harbour at the front of the",

          "Having been to Monaco several times but not visited this collection, I thought it was time, and it certainly is worth a trip. It is not huge but a fabulous collection from horse drawn vehicles to today's vehicles with a good selection of F1 cars as you might expect. All are",

          "Not a huge collection, but full of interesting vehicles in pristine condition. The building makes the visit easy, even if the shopping mall inside which it is located is less than impressive.",

          "This is a must visit for every car enthusiast. It has cars and buggys over 150 years old. All of them in immaculate condition. One can actually see how the automobile industry developed over the years. Many of the models on display are exclusive ones having built only as per",

          "Had free tickets as part of our Monaco passport. Worth a visit to see classic cars through the ages. Only takes around 1/2 to 45 mins of your time but if in the area, worth visiting",
          "Spent almost an hour here. Great collection of sparkling cars and older vehicles. Has the largest collection of old car vases too! Attraction opened at 10.00am and 4 members of staff started putting out staging and seating at precisely 10.00 am for an event there that evening.",

          "I am NOT a car person but I was riveted by this collection and enjoyed looking at each and every car. In some ways it is a very idiosyncratic collection of the late Prince Ranier but this only adds to the interest and range of vehicles on display. The museum is beautifully",
          "After our guide learned of our interest in racing and automobiles, she recommended this museum...and we were so glad she did! Beautiful cars, F1 racing cars and memorabilia, Ayrton Senna helmet...I could go on and on but I'll just say that if this interests you...you would be",

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series. The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15-kilometre (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182-kilometre (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.Monaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping). In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25\u201327 June.\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three separate countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9-kilometre (1.2-mile) swim, 90-kilometre (56-mile) bike ride and 21.1-kilometre (13.1-mile) run.\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco. An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.A municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide. The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.With Formula One Monaco GP it has some supporter series, FIA Formula 2 and Porsche Supercup. It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and other Formula Junior programs. \nFrom 10\u201312 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.,The women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo. There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco, founded in 1994.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language school specializing in business education and operated by the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales (INSEEC) group of schools.\n\n\n== Flag ==\n\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs. Adopted by Monaco on April 4, 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (adopted by Indonesia in August 17, 1945) except for the ratio of height to width.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.\n\n\n== Relations with other countries ==\n\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentOfficial Government Portal\nOfficial website of the Prince's Palace of Monaco\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\nMonaco Statistics Pocket \u2013 Edition 2014General information\"Monaco\".

          "If your a regular person and want to avoid the crowds and the fanciness, this is the place to go. The servers are friendly. The dealers are friendly and the atmosphere is just great. I will be back here to gamble and enjoy the entertainment.",
          "Today I went to cafe de Paris with a few friends. We are all in our 20s. It was pretty busy so we waited 10 minutes to be seated( which was fine) But when we got to the table, the table still had the cups from the previous clients, nobody came to clean them up. We then called",
          "When in Monaco, iot is a must to go and visit the Casina. if you are a gambler, bless your heart and enjoys losing your hard earned money, this place is great. If you are into watching folks come in and out, well having coffee and desert at the Cafe is a real treat. The cafe is",

          "You can\u2019t miss it and why would you ? It depicts what Monaco is all about and more. Great food and service a Must",
          "Before anyone says touristy, yes but who cares. Coming to Monte Carlo and not stopping for a drink here is like going to Paris and avoiding looking at the Eiffel Tower. From your little street side table you can enjoy the endless parade of beautiful cars and beautiful and not",
          "A ornate building housing the casino but lots to see outside, many expensive shops and restaurants plus many expensive cars, just as you would expect in Monaco!",
          "Great place, bit pricey - large beer 17EUR! That said you\u2019re in Monaco!! Great place to sit if you\u2019re into fast cars and people watching. Coffee in only 7EUR so can be done cheaply....",
          "not very friendly machines and kind of stuffy in there. they really needed some fresh air in there. and I am not really complaining about the smoke free atmosphere....they just really needed some climate control in there !",
          "Fabulous! I sat sipping a glass of champagne with a front row seat at this cafe and it was marvellous. I\u2019ve never seen so many brand new rolls royces go by. We had a club sandwich and smoked salmon sandwich - both delicious. Not cheap but worth every penny. I\u2019d happily travel",
          "Just as expected Great food, Great service and Great location. The kind of place that makes you feel special.",

          "Ok it was on a pricey side for cocktails, otherwise it was okay, but... the memories of the la creme de la creme watching unforgettable! Make sure to sit close to the road for vehicle observation and will soon become the next TopGear presenter. Great visit! Will come again.",
          "Good drinks and ice creams with the main attraction being the people watching aside the famous casino. Double the price of anywhere else but I guess it\u2019s a sacrifice you need to make for the location. We enjoyed the outside terrace and had a very pleasant experience. Service was",
          "This is a perfect example of an establishment that thinks that it doesn't need to try. Yes because of its location it will do business. But it will do less repeat business than it should. The service is woeful: the staff rude. I simply asked where the toilet was located and I",
          "A must! Such a beautiful site. Everywhere is so well taken care off and it looks just so beautiful. Plenty of designer shops in the area as well as some very nice cars to admire. It is pricey but is a massive tick off the bucket list !",
          "If you are visiting the area and have kids in tote, be sure to visit in the morning when children under 18 are actually allowed in the main lobby area. You can enter for free and just take a quick peek inside to get an inside view of the amazing architecture of the building and",
          "Ok it\u2019s a bit expensive, but let\u2019s be honest its one the THE places in Monaco. Anyone expecting value for money needs to have a rethink. Food was good (not the best but good), and the cost wasn\u2019t too bad. The big plus is people watching. If you want to see how elite live.",
          "Don't go to Monte Carlo without popping in for a drink, OK it is expensive. We spent an hour and a half there watching the world go by and the posers. We all loved it.",
          "Opulance! We enjoyed a bottle of Ruinart while watching beautiful cars drive by. A lovely place to relax!",
          "To be totally honest, there is nothing special about this place in regards to the food and the service, saying that the prices are pretty special too. The food is plainly average and the waiters really look fed up and disinterested. If this restaurant was anywhere else it",
          "Sat here for lunch. Really an ice cream parlour and a few cakes. Only two sandwiches available but the quality and service were great",
          "We hadn't planned to visit this caf\u00e9 but it's hard to walk past when you're sight seeing - it's in a really good location, lots of people and car watching, and the cocktails are exquisite - or you can get a tea or coffee with a cake. It's mega expensive but then everything in",

          "It's a well known place and nice to sit there for a drink and seeing lot of celebrities . Eating there was fine but was expecting much more especially for that expensive price .",
          "Compared to some of the reviewers we were lucky, very friendly and efficient waitress, perhaps choose a table serviced by a female. We did however witness some very unfriendly waiters, one who split a drink over a ladies legs and no apology. We however had a very pleasant time.",
          "Stopped off for a beer and a cocktail at Cafe de Paris, it just had to be done after I'd spent hours pacing the track in prep for the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix. Friendly service - elevated prices. Obviously due to its location, it's not everyday you can sit back and watch",
          "Passed by casino square and had to stop for a coffee here to watch the rich and famous in their playground ! Cars galore and F1 track being built what a great place to sit and watch . Unfortunately the service and attitude of waitress was not very friendly or efficient. Had to",
          "Cafe for fancy people, on the entrance they check what you bring inside like at some check point. I suppose it is for very rich people, and they don't want some regular guy inside.",
          "A beautiful cafe in front of the most over-rated place in Monaco. Ridiculously over-priced, but you are paying for a seat at a show, beautiful cars. and gawking tourists in shorts and cameras in front of the reflecting fountain. Worth visiting -one time",
          "The cafe is located just next to the front entrance of the Monte Carlo Casino. There are many outdoor tables and the service is very good. They offer a wide variety of drinks and a few ice creams. The prices are on the expensive side. But, it is a wonderful way to sit and",
          "Wow. The thousands of euros I saw played on one (1) black jack table, one (1) ultimate Texas hold'em table and the roulette wheel. And the elderly playing slots here looks just like the elderly playing slots in the USA & Singapore. They are zoned out. It was GREAT.",
          "We visited here with some friends today and found that security checking people entering were very rude and unaware of the seating availability. After my friend was turned away, his wife went to another entrance and got us all in. The drinks were also very expensive (NYC",
          "Situated next to the Monte Carlo Casino you get an excellent view of all the people walking by and expensive cas being driven by. There is seating in the sun or in the shade. Expect your bags to be inspected by security guards as you enter. Desserts were pricey but good.",
          "Loved people watching here, such an iconic place, 8euros for a coffee but its a must when visiting Monaco. They also search your bag on entry.",

          "Situated next to the Monte Carlo Casino you get an excellent view of all the people walking by and expensive cars doing their own personal lap of the F1 circuit. Firstly you have to pass a security guard who inspects bags and then passes the wand along your arms and around your",
          "Had dinner at Cafe de Paris - wine selection was excellent and the meal was well prepared and presented. The staff were very professional all of which led to a fantastic evening",
          "I\u2019ll be honest, we went here for coffee so that we could say we had been here. Unfortunately our visit coincided with a day tour of a gigantic cruise ship, so the outside terrace was packed. The waiters did however try their best to serve everyone in a timely manner, so kudos to",
          "Visited here for late morning drinks and had a fabulous hot chocolate with chantilly cream, nothing like anything I\u2019ve tasted before - it was really rich and thick! It was lovely sitting outside in the sunshine just taking in the atmosphere. Good service and wasn\u2019t rushed. Yes,",
          "This is the best place to view the passing public and weekend cars in Monte Carlo. You can pay a lot less on the Marina but here you can relax in the sun and watch the world go by in peace. Only issue is when , even not that busy, you can be waiting with empty glasses on you",
          "Whilst staying in Nice, we made the short trip to Monaco on the last evening of our holiday, to eat at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris and then spend a few hours across the square in the casino. Received a good welcome on arrival and table in a bright area in the restaurant., with plenty of",
          "When I\u2019ve been there, there were a lit of constructions around and the place was very noisy. Despite of that, take your time, go to the cafe, grab something to eat and drink and enjoy... you are in MONACO!",
          "I'm not a petty reviewer and this isn't intended to be a petty review; I would like to think that my comments are justified. We had a lovely day visiting Monaco, with Nice being our base for the holiday. We were told by numerous people that this is the 'go to' place in Monaco,",
          "Fantastic place to sit, drink some nice cocktails and watch the world go by. Whether that be other tourists taking selfies with the casino as a backdrop or all the amazing cars driving by",
          "We first attempted to go into Casino Monte Carlo, but bc I had on stylish jeans, see pic, I was not allowed in. Even though I had on a sequins top, expensive coat, gorgeous hat, and high heels. So weird. But we ended up at this Casino and it was soooo much better! We played",
          "Cafe de Paris has very modern gaming rooms, slot machines,American roulette,Black Jack..... The Cafe is also a brasserie built in style of the turn of the century, a terrace,a drugstore and coffee shop. Very modern,and admission free. Must see .",
          "Always best welcome, best service and good food, better choice the dish of the day, in general excellent. A unique place in Monaco, where you can watch Monaco life, be next to the Casino, have after a drink in the Amecican bar of Hotel de Paris. In what we call here the golden",
          "If you want to take a selfie in an expensive bar in the most expensive place on earth and to be surrounded by wannabees, then come here. The beers are 17 Euros (the nuts are nice) it is hot outside and you will be surrounded by people who just want to be seen. Keep it and go to",
          "Our group of 7 had enjoyed an afternoon paying \u20ac5 per pint down the road but were told to give this place a whirl. The glitz and glamour is clear to see and you have to go, but to charge \u20ac18 for a 3/4 glass of beer was to be expected. We\u2019ve ticked it off the list and I reckon",
          "It's right next to the Casino so sit outside so that you can see all of the people. Exquisite menu with exquisite prices to match. Enjoy it for the experience and the location. Check it off of your bucket list of fabulous places to go and fabulous things to do.",
          "Varied menu. Service was excellent. Location is unique but that being said the atmosphere was lacking.",
          "it is only here because of the silly tourists paying 6 euros for a cup of coffee to say that they have paid 6 euros for a cup of coffee at the cafe in Monte Carlo. If this was any other business model then it would have gone bust years ago. Watched customers arrive, wait and",
          "It may have been the place to be in the past, but this is nothing more than a restaurant/side walk cafe. Be prepared to pay exorbitant prices for very ordinary food. There are better cafes just across the street.",
          "A must visit while in Monte Carlo ! A beautiful building not cheap but well worth a visit ! You can have a look around the casino and designer shops while also enjoying stunning views !",
          "Nice place to sit and relax, right next to the casino. We sat and had a drink before we went back. Would not recommend to eat here, it\u2019s way to expensive.",
          "I was disappointed with my trip today to the reportedly famous Cafe De Paris in Monte Carlo. I was asked to pay for my drinks with cash whilst everyone else seemed to be paying for theirs by card. The reason I was given was that the WiFi was not working however others around us",
          "Very well positioned right opposite the Monte Carlo Casino with a nice outside area. Seriously overpriced but I guess it comes with the territory. Staff not too attentive and not very friendly even though it is understandable up to a point due to the fact that it is a very busy",
          "Visiting the casino and wanted a bite to eat but couldn\u2019t get in. Too crowded ... looked nice. I thought it was part of the casino",
          "So that would be about $20+ US dollars for a bowl of soup. In its defense, it does have vegetables in it. Just be prepared to drop some serious Euros when dining here but what a perfect setting! Just outside the Casino doors, around the corner from the Opera House, and right",
          "As stated in other reviews, the Cafe de Paris is situated adjacent to the Casino and an ideal place to start a visit to Monaco especially if you have not visited the city before. The Cafe is big and offers outside dining/drinks but its the interior restaurant that provides that",
          "Very good location and helpful staff, good service over all to sum up our experience. We ordered drinks and salads and stayed cool from the mid-day heat. The main course dishes were good as well. Bravoooo !!!",
          "If you're in France the best place to visit is the town of Monaco, and if you're in Monaco is not possible to pass on the 'Cafe de Paris'. Lots of fun and great time with friends.",
          "Perfect photo opportunity- gorgeous building & grounds. The best place to view all those gorgeous expensive cars. If you wish to gamble you need your passport but as we don\u2019t gamble we went inside as far as the casino entrance which is now \u20ac17 pp. We took photos of the card maze",
          "A must! Such a beautiful site. Everywhere is so well taken care off and it looks just so beautiful. Plenty of designer shops in the area as well as some very nice cars to admire.",
          "very nice atmosphere with many customers. are over 300 slots machines (i guess), some live tables (roulette, blackjack). there are 2 areas with slots wheren you can smoke, its like a terace (photo). there are stakes for everyone. you can play slots with 0,20 eur stake or over",
          "You can go in to get a glimpse of how the 1% live. It\u2019s a nice building to see but nothing more. Worth a picture stop.",
          "Located steps from the Monte Carlo casino, Casino Cafe de Paris has a fun, bustling vibe. You will want to sit close to the entrance to have the best view of the crowds that pass by. The food is good here as well, though you should come mainly for the experience of being here.",
          "Amazing cafe , very good location and helpful staff, good service over all .. very beautiful area around the cafe",
          "Convenient location in Monaco, Cafe de Paris sits right outside the Monte-Carlo Casino. Great view of the Place du Casino with the fountain in the middle and the lovely buildings and gardens in the area. Family of 4 stopped in for a quick bite after walking around town in the",
          "Was here on a day trip and had lunch with my family ,staff were very accommodating considering we were pure tourists shorts and all in there fine place ,food amazing and ordered a bottle of wine it was out of stock so gave me a more expensive one for the same price now that\u2019s",
          "Wanted to have a drink here after winning a bit of money in the casino but at 10 euros for a beer we decided to give it a miss and keep our winnings.",
          "Right outside the famous Monte-Carlo Casino. The place to go and sit outside and people watch as you sip a cool drink. You get to see Ferrari's, Maserati's, Convertible Rolls Royce's mixed in with the occasional Hyundai and VW. But be prepared the price is complementary to the",
          "The Cafe us walking distance to the Casino. Very good service, friendly. Menu is not bad , but nothing very special. Having said that I ordered a steak, and it was excellent. So not a sophisticated menu, but good food and service. Monte Carlo prices, so not cheap, but worth a",
          "We only had time for a quick meal. Unfortunately we sat at the rear of the outside restaurant so couldn\u2019t people and car watch. However service was good - meal cam quickly as we requested and was very nice. Expensive but no more so than we expected given it\u2019s Monte Carlo",
          "The food is average but too expansive for the quality,Better have a drink on the terrasse to watch the exclisive cars",
          "Waiter 100 yo and was so slow took 20min was o put in order of coffee only 20mins to bring wrong coffee couldn\u2019t be bothered waiting again for right order Took 30 minutes to get his attention to pay bill No excuses the place had 3 people drinking coffee only Only good",
          "Our first night in Monte Carlo so we had a walk round to get our bearings. Stumbled across casino square purely by chance. Decided we would eat at the cafe. Really good location right in the square, ideal to sit and people watch. We sat in the outside section of the restaurant.",
          "Glitz and razzmatazz make up this casino. Seems to get glitzier every year. Finally think they have reached the point of overkill.",
          "We stopped for a coffee on the patio. It was a beautiful day and thoroughly enjoyed watching the fancy cars go by and people from all over the world. We stayed an entire hour. The only sad part was that we were in the middle of the Grand Prix preparation. The entire city",
          "A nice little casino with a great selection of modern machines, well laid out with a good atmosphere and a lot of character. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the are and like a little gambling.",
          "Great place for a relaxed G&T with friends prior to the Casino, enjoyed chatting and watching the world go by. Not the cheapest, but equally quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.",
          "Very expensive - 8\u20ac for coffee!! Very cold stuff. Just the view worth it. Casino is nearby the restaurant.",
          "Nice place with very pleasant and professional staff. A must do While in montecarlo. Formal place but flexible",
          "You can't beat it. The Cafe de Paris is just one of those places you have to experience. People watching and car watching taken to an extreme level..but why not?",
          "expensive no fun , good to mark a place as visited , bad service... very busy with tourists cannot enjoy a good time.",
          "just went in for a coffee really it was ok, great place, can imagine it has a really good atmosphere in the summer we went in as it was snowing and cold and just needed a hot drink",
          "Decided to treat ourselves - Sun was out and we enjoyed cafes (latte and express) & shared a crepe. Lovely way to spend late morning watching the world literally go by!",
          "Never again! Disgusting food and cheap tea served at 8.5 euro. Service is poor and you\u2019re asked to pay the bill when you\u2019re not even half finished! Unless you\u2019re a regular guest and they know you, not recommended. Pricey but this is not even an issue. You get nothing for what",
          "This was absolutely gorgeous in decor, my husband and I were here because we were scratching off a bucket list trip. I had braised veal and my hubby had cheeseburger, he\u2019s not as adventurous as I when it comes to trying new foods, he claims best cheeseburger he ever had, he even",
          "I visited Nice on a solo trip and Monaco was one of the day visits I decided to make during my stay in the South of France. I opted for food within my comfort zone and ordered the Penne Arrabiata which wasn't a disappointment! The dish was delightful, the staff were helpful",
          "Why not? You can see expensive cars and do rich people watch, Just a quick stop coming from Place du Palais.",

          "A tick in the box for people watching and casino watching. The wine was average, but very expensive as expected. The cake was inedible...dry, old and a complete rip off. Staff not friendly...quelle surprise.",
          "Great place which you have to attend when in Monaco..... attentive waiters in a lovely environment, sat outside in the sun. Kept being brought complimentary nibbles. People watching great fun. Didn't eat ourselves, but food looked amazing and not expensive as you may think.",
          "A must visit even just to see the clientel and expensive cars Some nice gardens opposite The place to be seen",
          "We had dinner there as guest of a local couple who live in Monaco. The food was fabuloso! The service was over the top. There were 6 in our party and we had 6 waiters attending to us. Maybe it was because our hosts dine the often, but the staff was exceptional. They made us feel",
          "I have watched the gradual decline and the catering to a low common denominator. The prices are high the quality is mediocre and its full of tourists.",
          "The good is a good selection of modern machines and some tables, but the bad is that you can't even get a normal priced drink, let alone a free drink. Expect to pay 6 euros for just a Coke or small bottle of orangina.... I know Monaco is expensive but if you want people to stay",
          "This Sunday l tried again to have a meal with the family, the last time l tried was about 1 week ago and again l was disappointed with the service and the reception service. It is really incredible that with so much personel, the guests can not get a proper service. We waited",

          "When in Monte Carlo you do as they do!....this lovely casino is just buzzing with people all having fun...so much choice of machines. There is a lovely little bar too which is great when you need a stiff drink or two! You don't need to go in with a lot of money or get too",
          "I enjoyed the original interior of the Cafe with all season's illustrations on the walls. The food is good, with an amazing choice of sweets, try the chocolat mousse and their chocolat noir. The place reeks of glamour, richness and a lot of foreigners specially Russians all",
          "If you think that people-watching is a worthwhile experience you may enjoy this place. However, you aren't going to see any \"celebs\" here, only posers and tourists.

          "We dropped by when visiting Monaco. You can't visit Monaco and not see the casino, that's just the way it is! We didnt go inside, as most of the group don't do well in crowds. To be honest, I found the cars more interesting than the casino. Red ferraries filled the parking spots",
          "Amazing experience of this place, much more then expected. This place is always crowded due to luxury cars parked just outside and there were many more just passing by. If you love luxury cars you will see many here.",

          "I'm a company director and also an attractive woman which the staff found hard to decipher. More than one dealer at the blackjack table treated with me with vulgar open displays of jealousness questioning what I was playing etc. Avoid at all costs. Spend or make your money as it",
          "Some rather expensive shops in this area by the casino, but a lovely water feature out the front. We were able to walk around the casino and get some great views, but were not allowed in.",
          "This is a great way to get a feel for how much money there is in Monaco! With the designer shops just next door, the staff treat you amazing in them and can't do enough for you. Everywhere you look there are expensive cars, Ferraris and bentleys are almost every other car you",
          "If you're reading this you will surely not head to the place for shopping, but it's nice to walk around and see the most luxurious shops in Monaco which is also the most luxurious in the French Riviera",

          "Unfortunately we did not had a good at that place however we had there few drinks and coffees. Great location with an amazing view of one of the most expensive cars in the world. If u in Monaco Monte Carlo you should top over in there just to have a look! Have fun!",
          "Must have ID even if you're 50. Personnel efficacious and rude. What's to see in this fake opulence. Not appealing. However facade of Hotel de Paris worth a long look, tr\u00e8s elegant. Tons of construction, elegant shops now tucked away in pods. A very tiny congested town",

          "Went here after the Monte Carlo Casino, to see what was up. Definitely a different experience. Purely slots in the main room, and even has a large smoking room/area in the back with slot machines. I think there were tables games up or downstairs but didn't bother to explore.",
          "So many nice things on the card. Just do not complain about the prices. The quality is extremely good. For cheap just go somewhere else and not to Monaco. For sure this is the place where we relax the next visit !!",

          "Seriously over priced \u20ac46 for the steak, however, the place was packed and so doubt I doubt the prices will drop. It is in the centre on Monte Carlo, opposite the casino, and so you are paying for that. The steak was ok.",
          "A wonderful and fun filled experience.the ambience was awesome but complementary services were none, which is quite common in other Casinos. It was fun n I believe anybody in Monaco needs to have a feel of it!",
          "When in Monte Carlo you just have to look inside this magnificent building. The architecture really is beautiful. I did not go to gamble, just to look, definitely worth a quick squint inside to see just where it all happens, the gambling that is. You do come out feeling somewhat",
          "One of the main attractions in Monte Carlo. We were a bit surprised that there weren't more people inside, but then looking at the decor you tend to forget about the gambling. Inside is as beautiful at the outside, which is stunning.",
          "We absolutely loved hanging out there for the afternoon as this place is as iconic as it gets in Monaco. The weather was perfect and the place beautiful. We loved all the fancy cars parked in front as well. A must do while in Monte Carlo.",

          "Had a drink here before visiting the Casinos. The adjoining casino was a bit disappointing as it was nothing special. If you have a casino where you live, this one will be nothing new. The main Monte Carlo casino, although costing \u20ac10 entry, is much more interesting.",

          "We enjoyed our stop at the outdoor caf\u00e9. This was an wonderful place to people watch. The service was very good and our order was delivered after a very short wait. But it is very pricey as we spent 15 Euros for 2 Cokes. A bit of a shock to the wallet but it was fun to sit and",
          "Typical casino food, over priced and not as flavorful as you'd expect. Burger? 30\u20ac. Salad? 20-31\u20ac. Really your gambling money is spent on food, expect to pay big if you want to enjoy a meal here.",

          "Nice to sit and watch expensive cars and beautiful people. The prices are low, but I guess it can't be different just for location. But the stuff was really bad. I mean a lot of clients were dissappointed about the service. For this prices it must be much better",
          "We love sitting in this caf\u00e9, sipping wine and watching all the cool cars, beautiful people and crowds of tourists. It's a delight sitting here and seeing things you'll never see at home. Yes, it's a little pricey and yes, the outside menu is limited...but just look at the",

          "The coffee is terrible, the water for the tea lukewarm and expensive but its all worth it to sit and watch the goings on in Casino Square!",
          "While travelling on a cruise recently my husband myself and two of our close friends enjoyed a trip ashore to Monte Carlo and had to have coffee and a cake at the Cafe de Paris. What an amazing setting close to the Casino and Hotel de Paris. The coffee and cake was very nice and",
          "Great view of the Montecarlo Casino, you can spend all day people and car watching, the only major draw back is the cost, \u20ac5.50 for a very poor coffee.",
          "The location is great, this is the reason why I wanted to have lunch there. Service is terrible and the food as well! I didn\u00b4t like it at all. When I go back to Monaco I will definitely go to that restaurant again because of its location but probably just order something to",
          "Food was mediocre at best. Service was indifferent. Waiter did not bother even to pour the water into our glasses or to clean the bread crumbs before dessert. Just taking out order appears to be an imposition. The only efficient thing was the bill which came even before we",

          "Had to have tea at Cafe de Paris during a day trip to Monaco. Our order of 5 slices of cake at \u20ac7 each somehow became 5 fruit pastries at \u20ac15 each, but the waiters were quite disappointing as we expected them to be much more churlish, as we had been warned, and we were",
          "The food was good and the service was decent. Just don't expect your server to check in with you to find out how your meal is",
          "Very expensive but as this is the only eating place outdoors in casino square you have no option but to go there. Lots of very rich posh people there. Food average.",
          "The service is nothing great, the menu has some good selections but the reason you go is to people watch. If you are lucky enough to grab a seat close to the street you will get the best view. Beautiful cars and \"interesting\" people. Worth the stop!",
          "This is one of the most famous casino's in the world and a place you must visit while in Monte Carlo. I was unsure of dress code before going but a jacket is not needed. unfortunately there were people with bikini's that could be seen through cover ups. You are made to check",
          "We always make a point of coming here when we are in Monaco. It is very popular and you often have to \" hover \" until you can grab a table as someone leaves. It is the perfect place for people and car watching. Be prepared for a wait for service but its worth it. It's quite",
          "Stopped for drinks and a spot of people/flash car watching in this cafe. Bad start when we were ignored when trying to find a table, so we seated ourselves and awaited service. Menus and drinks came fairly swiftly but the service from our waiter was surly bordering on hostile.",
          "The location is great. It is situated in the right side of the great Monaco Casino. It is always very crowded and hard to find a table. A little expensive but it is worth it. The cafe is composed of two parts, the eating and the drinking section. Staff is very polite. You can",
          "As reviewed previously, the cafe is divided into a eating and a drinking section--we went to the eating. The seating process was pretty perfunctory, and we were left to consider our choice for a long time. After ordering, nothing happened for a long while-we at least expected",
          "The Rolls and the Maseratis and the glittering crowd make you gape at this ultimate rich people's paradise. The champagne is impeccably chilled while the waiters hover around just the right amount. The food could be better though - I have had better grilled salmon and carpaccio",

          "What you need to know about this restaurant is that its actually in two parts. The front being for drinks only, no food and then the restaurant tables are set further back. We sat at the front to begin with and enjoyed a Kir Royale and a Monaco beer. Service was swift and",

          "As you'd expect for such a premium location the prices do match but it is a great location to see the glitz and glamour of Monaco. Service was quite slow and tables not cleared quickly which is disappointing.",
          "Fabulous Fun! Loved it all, atmosphere, people, drinks and service. To see so many great cars go by with an A-position seat was incredible - get there early though.",
          "Could not get a seat in the cafe during the grand prix so settled for a scoop of citron from Morelli's and wasn't disappointed. The gelato was perfectly sour and sweet at the same time.",
          "Well - What do you expect? This is after all one of the most famous Cafe's in the world. We were in Monaco for the 2013 F1 and it was a 'must do'. We sat there for a couple of hours during the practice sessions watching the cars race by - it was worth every penny.",
          "You go to the Cafe de Paris because of its location and to watch the world go by or more likely the stream of luxury cars, rather than for the food and drink. It's pricey as you would expect, however for the experience it's definitely worth a visit. Suggest you take it for what",
          "This is the high traffic area just outside the casino lots of tables and surprisingly the service was good. Food expensive but then your in Monte Carlo..... The food was excellent but plan on dropping 50E for a very light lunch. As others have said though \"sit and watch the",

          "We stopped here for a lovely prix fixe lunch with wine before walking in the Monte Carlo casino. It is done in the belle epoque style of design. Our lunch started with a fabulous cold pea soup with fresh fava beans scattered in it. Next was a lovely fish dish. It was an",

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series. The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15-kilometre (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182-kilometre (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.Monaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping). In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25\u201327 June.\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three separate countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9-kilometre (1.2-mile) swim, 90-kilometre (56-mile) bike ride and 21.1-kilometre (13.1-mile) run.\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco. An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.A municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide. The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.With Formula One Monaco GP it has some supporter series, FIA Formula 2 and Porsche Supercup. It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and other Formula Junior programs. \nFrom 10\u201312 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.,The women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo. There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco, founded in 1994.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language school specializing in business education and operated by the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales (INSEEC) group of schools.\n\n\n== Flag ==\n\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs. Adopted by Monaco on April 4, 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (adopted by Indonesia in August 17, 1945) except for the ratio of height to width.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.\n\n\n== Relations with other countries ==\n\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentOfficial Government Portal\nOfficial website of the Prince's Palace of Monaco\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\nMonaco Statistics Pocket \u2013 Edition 2014General information\"Monaco\".

          "We visited the museum on July 2020, so it was quite empty that time, which was awesome. Me and my wife are divers, we are so into the sea creatures. The museum shows good collections from many species. We totally loved it.",
          "This complex is located in a very beautiful castle by the sea, we have beautiful fish and marine specimens, it is to do",
          "Really enjoyed walking around ,well laid out and the display tanks brilliant, could have stayed there all day",
          "This was really interesting to see. A couple of hours after reaching Monaco we went here as it was raining on the day. We enjoyed a few hours inside the aquarium as it had a variety of fish to see. There is also an outside part with turtles but we couldn't go out as it was",
          "A blend of an extension aquarium on the lower levels, coupled with a more traditional museum. Very impressive curiosity cabinet dominates an entire wall in one large room. Good views from the roof at the top of the building too. Well worth a visit.",
          "Amazing visit - well worth the ticket price. This is a wonderful building, quite unlike what you would expect from the outside. There are so many great things to do. My boys (9 and 6) decreed it the best day out ever!",
          "We were very lucky to grab a brilliant offer from British Airways which included a \u2018Passport to Monaco\u2019 which included a range of free tickets (including free helicopter transfers from and to Nice airport - a brilliant experience in itself). Disappointingly we couldn\u2019t use the",
          "Stunning building built into the side of a cliff overlooking the blue Mediterranean, possibly the grandest facade you will see for an aquarium! Inside we started off in the aquarium which was by far the busiest section but was not overbearing and you could still view all the",
          "Excellent place to visit with kids. Aquarium is a must see. I really enjoyed seeing the turtles and sharks. I am so happy to be able to visit this place.",
          "Absolutely spectacular aquarium experience. Great exhibits of aquatic life from around the world and even historical exploration exhibits in the upstairs museum.",
          "In my opinion this is the main attraction of the \u201cRock\u201d. The \u201cTemple of the sea\u201d built more than 100 years ago by Prince Albert I, how was a passionate navigator and explorer. Inaugurated in 1910 after 11 years of construction this 4 story building looks like is carved in stone.",
          "Really good. Worth it. Stunningly beautiful and MUST visit the sea turtles. The building itself is beautiful. The aquariums are gorgeous. Sea horses mesmerizing.",
          "I enjoyed every bit of this museum. The best part was the ways we can save the ocean. All the fish, turtle and ocean life is explored and explained in several languages. It is a great way to spend the day.",
          "acquariums are fantastic and the turtles pool is amazing too arrived early so you have space to do your visit its busy at weekend",
          "This museum is definitely worth a visit. It takes at least 2 hours to explore the aquarium. You can enjoy viewing local marine life as well as species from other environments. There was a lot of variety, history of Prince Albert's oceanographic interests and the famous Jacques",
          "Not worth it, verry croudy and too many people. We were there during christmas eve 2020 and couldn,t walk in the aquarium",
          "Coming from Cairns, the aquarium is not something we\u2019d normally visit, however given that the museum was attached and the building looked amazing, we decided to visit. Definable year the highlight of our day in Monaco. The aquarium was very tastefully done and the museum",
          "This place is fantastic and is interesting for both children and adults. It\u2019s the best aquarium that I\u2019ve visited, and I\u2019ve been to a few across the globe. Set across three floors plus a roof top terrace, the museum has tanks full of all kinds of fish plus a garden area where",
          "It is a blend of aquarium and museum . The variety of sea animals is mesmerising. Very well maintained . Museum show much effort has been made to explore the possibilities of sea life . The efforts and concern of royal family of Monaco as environmentalist is exemplary.",

I was very pleasantly surprised that the royal family of Monaco we\u2019re so involved in environmental",
          "Musee Oc\u00e9anographique is a very interesting architectural building built into and from the mountainside. Prince Albert was an enthusiast for all things oceanographic and built this dedicated structure for oceanography in 1910 donating it to Monte Carlo. The city is rightly",
          "This is a mix of maritime museum and living aquarium. It is well worth the visit. I would suggest around two hours to see all it has to offer.",
          "This is by far the best aquarium we have visited. We spent a good 3 hours here with two young children and they did not get bored at all.",
          "We went to this museum because we thought it would focus on Jacques Cousteau and have information and artifact related to his work. The museum is actually all about the oceanographic endeavor of Prince Albert I, and then the less interesting and seemingly more contrived work of",
          "Liked it very much! Highly recommended for visit any time you are in Monte Carlo! Visited with my family and it was great",
          "A lot of unique species and sea animal with fascinating colour & shape. This place is definitely worth the visit for those underwater lover.",
          "A good museum, with plenty of exhibits and an aquarium to see. It is a recommended activity in the country, however if you are here on a day trip then perhaps there is no need to visit\u2026 good but probably not worth a few hours of your time on your day trip",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit. Cousteau, the guy who did all the old documentary underwater world films somehow was head of operations here. That just tells you how much knowledge about the Oceans went into this museum. I won't go into the details regarding the exhibition",
          "Getting down into the town is a bit of a challenge whichever way you come but worth the experience. The Museum is a mix of interesting things and beautiful architecture. The whole city is like lego land with everything a big country has but in mini.",
          "This place is amazing and reminds us what we have done with Earth Oceans, we must to change our behavior ro change our mentalities. This place should be for another things, not for discover species in jail. But inside it is so huge and beautiful to see.",
          "Really amazing museum with a lot of different Seaworld. This is also the museum of Jacques Cousteau.",
          "We have visited a number of aquariums and I must say this is the best we\u2019ve been to. So much to see and for the kids to do including a sea life encounter session and a VR experience, both of which were for an added cost, but worth it. Having said that our kids don\u2019t speak a word",
          "I have been to many aquariums and this one rated as spectacular. Great for all the family. Take your time to explore and linger. So much to see!!!",
          "We visited with a small child, and kept her in her stroller. It is a beautiful building and nice museum, but far too many tourists let their children ran around wild screaming and playing. It is a museum but felt like a playground. Five stars for the environment. One star for",
          "We've been to alot of aquariums. this was one of if not the best. Something not to miss if you are at the French Riviera.",
          "Amazing museum with his history installations and etc but .. for 14\u20ac you will get just very short exhibition of some aquariums and museum. We spend there an hour and we visited everything. P.s for kids I think its amazing and perfect place you will not get tired of walking a lot",
          "We spent about three hours at this magnificent museum and could have spent even longer! Of course that is also possible as they have quite a good restaurant there, too. There are many big and small fish tanks as well as tanks to observe other sea animals and plants. There are",
          "In this amazing building in Monaco a fantastic experience awaits for those who love aquariums and the history connected. We came mostly for the aquarium, however the museum was just as fascinating. Take your time to listen to the stories, they are worth it. Only downside was",
          "Very, very interesting. Allow hours to really enjoy. If you have clostophia, you may have a hard time. Because of displays, it is not very bright inside and it is downstairs mostly. Don't miss a thing. It is also outside at the end. Afterwards, beautiful view from top outside",
          "The Oceanographic Museum is wonderful. It has an excellent collection of fish, in all sorts of different aquariums and naturally decorated. There is also an other section of the museum. It is for the ocean explorers and their history. It is beautifully done and a must see.",
          "This was an absolute highlight on our day trip to Monaco. The most beautiful building and a great aquarium, as well as great rehabilitation centre. I would really recommend this and it\u2019s a short walk from the Palace with great views.",
          "Monaco is a beautiful city. It is built on pure stones. Amazing view from the top of the hills. Visit the Mus\u00e9e oc\u00e9anique is one my highlight. Although this beautiful city is built around wealths, do not have any expectations when going to public toilets (Dirty /old and no",
          "This museum is just a short way from the Prince's palace , as a passable restaurant on the roof and we spent a very enjoyable 2 hours there and did not really tour the upper floor . I have to say the aquarium is well designed and laid out BUT i was personally a little disturbed",
          "Visiting aquariums is one of my passions. I was surprised and pleased to visit this one -- it far exceeded my expectations. And the most amazing feature thereof is that it's almost 150 years old!",
          "very beautiful location, many species, the building is beautiful, the price is correct, it is absolutely necessary",
          "This small museum has a wonderful collection of interesting sea life. Children on the day we were there were running from one display to the next, excited by the amazing colors of the fish and various sea creatures. We spent a very pleasant hour there....and saw many creatures",
          "What a wonderful aquarium! Plan to spend several hours including lunch at the rooftop cafe. Delicious! Also on the upper terrace are panoramic views, lovely breezes, a children\u2019s play area and an enclosure with plenty of tortoises. We hated to leave.",
          "This aquarium may not be as large or flashy as some, but it has a remarkably large selection of fish and other local ocean life with very clear identification and explanations. The two resident sea turtles are a bonus! Interesting even if you just like to look at the pretty",
          "During a daytrip to Monaco, we visited this museum. It's a must, don't miss it! The adult ticket is 16 eur, its nothing! Absolutely worth the price. I always found myself watching the animals with an open mouth... its incredible! So interesting, so beautiful. My favourite part",
          "An aquarium with a difference. Several species I have never seen before, such as a nautical shell with inhabitant, and a cuttlefish. Also seahorses and an octopus. There are the fish one usually sees, and interesting tanks of jellyfish etc.Finishing with a couple of turtles",
          "The tanks seem tiny. The sharks seemed crowded and the octopus was scaling the walls of its tiny enclosure trying to escape or hide but never quite managing to get there. There was nowhere for them to retreat to if they felt overwhelmed, just a small triangle to live in. There",
          "Although one of the \"old-style\" aquariums (mostly small tanks displaying creatures found in the Mediterranean), it has a great deal of good displays and information. Built atop and going down the side of a cliff (inside), there's one very large aquarium that's a few stories",
          "Fabulous place to visit. Fascinating variety of sea life. Only downside is the difficulty of driving to the right place to park.",
          "The view from the opposing side of the museum is just terrific. The backdrop is unobtrusive and if you continue on your way down, you'll find a nice little swimming hole!",
          "I must say whenever i have friends visiting me, the museum is on my visit list. This time, however, i was truly shocked by the new so called attraction of turtles. It is an outside location next to the museum, nicely landscaped at the first look. But the water bassin with one",
          "A very amazing museum, contains all kinds of fish and sea creatures, its a 4 floors museum. The display is also unique with special lighting effects. It also has big sea turtles. Definitely worth a visit while in MONACO.",
          "I think this attraction is one of \"must to see\" in Monako. It has 3 or 4 floors. There are the biggest turtle we\u00b4ve ever seen. You can see thousands of type of fishes either sea water or fresh water. Price is accordingly you could see. We bought ticket in combination with",
          "This Monaco Oceanographic Museum has a long tradition (from 1910) but is perhaps the most known as a place where a naval legend Jacques-Yves Cousteau (a naval explorer, filmmaker, innovator, photographer, author and researcher) was director from 1957 to 1988. Therefore there is",
          "Good museum in a fantastic building and a convenient location near the princes palace and 15 mins walk from the port. Lots of different sea-life creatures, from fish to jelly fish, stingrays to turtles and a large room with pre-historic skeletons. Was nice to have a walk round",
          "This Museum was there with Cousteau and the Grimaldi decades before it was fashionable for cities to have a Oceanographic. Recently refurbished with great care it is a must do on the Cote d Azur and Monaco",
          "Beautiful museum, very nice location and building. Great view from the roof. Only downside: the tanks are very small. I hope they'll give the fish some more space in the future.",
          "I went here with an excursion. The museum was located in a beautiful building and was overall a lot nicer and more beautiful than I expected. Lovely view from the roof as well. Only downside was that I the tanks were really tiny. I hope they'll give the fish some more space in",
          "This place puts the UK sealife centres to absolute shame! Beautiful building. Absolutely beautiful displays, large tanks full of beautiful fish. We spent a good couple of hours in there. Very reasonable prices, 16euro for an adult and 8 for a child. Honestly, a great place to",
          "The building is amazing. The museum has a lot of nice objects and I loved the fact that they have a whole section about preserving the Ocean but (and this is a big but) where are the recycling bins? Let alone recycling, they should not be selling any single-use plastics in and",
          "A good experience and lots of different fish to see in the aquarium. We did find it very busy and therefore difficult to see some of the exhibits. The turtle exhibit outside was brilliant with the backdrop of views from the sea. The museum was also good.",
          "Great place to visit. So well organized and well kept too. Recommend to get your online pass or tickets.",
          "We absolutely loved this museum, the fish were amazing and the turtles, we would highly recommend this visit",
          "The museum was founded by the best and kept all their experience, passing from old to young. many activities for the kids, for both, brain and body. One can see highly skilled professionals taking care of the animals. Staff very friendly and always happy to share their knowledge",
          "My husband traveled in with a cruise ship and decided to check out the museum. We walked from the port to the museum, which was a gorgeous walk! The museum's ticket was of normal price and you were able to walk up to machine or wait in line. We walked up to the machine because",
          "This aquarium is situated in a beautiful location the walk there from the bus stop along the coast is lovely. The building itself is fabulous.. tickets were around 35e for 2 people and for the few hours I think it is worth it. More space is definitely needed for the amount of",
          "The aquarium is fun to visit with good and interesting descriptions. They do not have huge fish tanks but there are some beatiful and unusual species. There was not too much crowd allowing for comfortable visit - I recommend to buy joint ticket to palace and aquarium earlier. In",
          "This is the most stunning aquarium I have ever seen, with some fantastic displays. However, the space given to a lot of the sea life is insufficient with stress behaviours evident in a number of tanks. Visit but be aware, this is effectively a zoo, so not the best way of seeing",
          "Amazing place! We were invited and had a private tour...wonderful experience! It is highly recommend to stop here when touring the area!",
          "A really good day full of fascinating things to see. It cost \u20ac16 each and it was well worth the money. They have tanks full of wonderful sea life including sharks and a wide variety of fish. Each tank has interactive information in French, Italian and English. The sea turtles",
          "The museum itself was wonderful and so well done but I was so upset to see x2 massive sea turtles in such a small enclosure - the tank should be atleast x5 times the size... please do something about this hence the low rating :(",
          "Great place and venue, It was amazing to see how much effort has gone it looking after the local marine life. Nice and cool place on a hot n sunny day.",
          "My partner and I visited Monaco for the day from Nice and decided to visit this attraction; it certainly made it worth while. The aquarium was fantastic, with numerous species and plenty of information regarding them. The outdoor turtle conservation area was a treat, with an",
          "Such an amazing museum. We were impressed with the location and the quality of the exhibits. We highly recommend stopping here if you are ever in this area.",
          "The museum is a living organism. It has hundreds of marine animals in all kind of sizes of aquariums. It is an excellent place for kids to visit; they will learn a lot and excite their imagination. I ennjoyed my visit, and I wish I spend more time, but we were on a time table. I",
          "Cool aquarium and I guess we were lucky in early July 2019 when we went as it was not that crowded. It's not big like the Genova aquarium (180 KM further east in Italy) but it's cool. Note that it is on south-east side of the mountain (on top of mountain) south of the port",
          "We enjoyed our visit here! The turtle exhibit was very cool, and they had several other tanks with diverse species. The only reason it did not earn a 5-star from me was that I expected to see more live fish and creatures. The aquarium part was only half of the museum and the",
          "I waited for this visit , given location and advertisement i was sure we will see a big aquarium or something similar , instead the concept of the place is a lot of small aquariums with marine life who looked miserable and suffering , place was hot, over crowded and didn\u2019t",
          "We went here on a friday around 2 o\u2019clock, it was busy but not packed so we could still see all the fish in the aquaria. The enclosures fit the theme and it was all high quality technology, the fish looked healthy. The sea turtle enclosure outside was amazing overlooking the",
          "Awesome experience! Great for families with kids and ocean lovers! This is not your average aquarium!",
          "Most beautifully done ocean museum ever! Give yourself enough time to really take in all the interesting items the museum has to show.",
          "Excellent museum where sea miracles are displayed by geogrphical zones with great music and lights arrangement. Situated close to Prince palace. The visit of both places makes a nice day journey.",
          "Everytime we\u2018re here we have to visit this place, our daughter and myself are amazed by all the different species they hold. Even though the place is kind of small and you can browse quickly through it it\u2019s worth a visit. And enjoy the view of this stunning building litterally",
          "We have been to a lot of aquariums and my husband really didnt want to do another one. He really enjoyed it, was so glad he went. It's amazing , well worth your time. Highly recommend it.",
          "It was the first time to me, I never been in an Aquarium before but I really wanted and I can say I love it \ud83d\ude0d it was wonderful! For a little bit I felt like a little mermaid in the bottom of the see \ud83d\ude1a it was very interesing the part with the jelly fishs, the light changed",
          "Perched on a cliff by the palace gardens, this museum has plenty to see. Many aquarium displays with tons of fish and other marine creatures, a fossil display, a deep sea dive simulator, displays on marine exploration and a turtle rescue center. All that and a restaurant and",
          "We absolutely loved it here! An absolute must do. The aquarium itself is the highlight rather than the museum but your ticket allows you into both. They have a turtle tank and lots of variety of fish too. It was very educational with interactive information telling you about the",
          "Smart and modern display of marine life and artefacte that pleases everybody. One visit is never enough.",
          "We were inspired to take advantage of the offer through Hop on Hop off. Very minimal line as you arrive, multiple options for viewing, educational for everyone regardless of age, interactive for children 12 and under, options of touching the sea life as you enter, outside area",
          "This Aquarium type museum was well thought out and beautiful to the eyes. It had many variations of animals that I have no seen before. It can be done in an hour if you rush.",
          "Visited the aquarium of the museum between 10 and noon. The place was not packed but there was quite a lot of people and children. No problem with getting good views of all the aquarium tanks, though! The place gives off a vibe of being quite small and not very extraordinary",
          "For 30 years, Jack Eve Cousteau's was the director of the museum. The number one place to visit in Monaco!",
          "Although the entire aquarium settings are of modest size, the electronic screens in multiple languages give new insight to the unique creatures in the tanks. The hatching fish were fascinating. The jellyfish were beautifully displayed. Saw some sea life that we\u2019d never seen",
          "You need to have at least 2 hrs to nicely enjoy the beauty that the museum has to offer. The fish we've seen here were unique, the history behind this museum is inspiring too. The ticket costs 14 per adult. We confirm this is worth it. Perfectly maintained museum, great stuff,",
          "A great place, with the aquarium a great place to start off. There is a large variety of fish, jellyfish, sea turtles etc to keep everyone entertained! Then it\u2019s upstairs for the rest of the museum. Well worth spending 2-3 hours here, and \u20ac10 for a student isn\u2019t bad!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the aquarium which also includes a museum. There are various different sea creatures to look at which are displayed well. We particularly enjoyed seeing the sea turtles. A lovely way to spend a couple hours.",
          "It is possible to buy a combined ticket to the palace and the oceanographic museum if you wish. I had not appreciated the first Prince Albert's interest in oceanography and how much he had invested into scientific research of our seas and oceans in the early 1900's until I",
          "This is a fantastic way to spend 2-3 hours! A wonderful museum with so many amazing sea creatures! This is a must see!",
          "While we could not go inside, the views from outside are beautiful. You can take beautiful photos of the museum with the sea in the background from the small park area adjacent to it.",
          "The museum isn't too large so it won't take too much of your time. The aquariums are awesome and the biggest highlight of the place. As a tip, also check out the building from the Sea side as well. It is fascinating how they have built it on the top of the Sea.",
          "This adorable building meets you exactly after packing's exit by escalator. In front of museum you can see some interesting statues, like golden skull, and the most famous one is yellow submarine from immortal hit of \"The Beatles\". Visiting for sure recommended for families with",
          "Went there on a weekday with a child. the place wasn't too busy. The aquarium part (lower floors) is amazing by its range of fish and aquatic life. The upper levels offer a great insight on the research associated with the museum.",
          "Very nice and fancy old building on the shoreline. Lots of species to observe in the aquariums. And the giant sea turtle is incredible. I had the chance to lift the drone up and see the building from outside as well from a seagull perspective.",
          "If you have spare time I really recommend to visit. There is free wifi and you can download a special app with written and audio information about sea creatures and every item in the display. Also beautiful building and great park just outside.",
          "Having visited the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco you certainly know a lot more about various fishes and other sea animals in various seas, the seas themselves as well s about exploring the seas and sea life. There are fantastic aquariums, informative interactive tables to",
          "I have spend 5 hours in these beautiful building and great set up. I also learn a lot about Prince of Monaco giving a lot of his time and contribution as his ancestor to protect but also give some interest how to save our ocean and planet",
          "This place combines aquarium with oceanic museum which was impressive. The setting was beautiful. It\u2019s housed in a well maintained historical building. The museum isn\u2019t too big but it\u2019s huge for Monaco\u2019s tiny area she has to offer. It\u2019s expensive but well worth the visit. The",
          "Great location, even the road to it is beautiful, worth the \"climbing\". The building is fabulous and you find two different types of exhibition: aquariums and museum (about oceanography, expeditions, ships etc). I recommend to buy combined tickets with the Prince Palace, jut a",
          "Great collection of sealife. Enough space to accommodate large crowds of visitors. Large exhibition of maritime artefacts and equipment. Perfectly suitable for children. Easy to get there on a hop-on-hop-off bus (bus pass can be bundled with a museum ticket).",
          "Awesome aquarium! Though the animal selection does not rival Monterey or Chicago, it is definitely world-class, and the museum was fantastic--skeletal display of large ocean-dwelling mammals was really cool (and very appealing for my 5-year old). Highly recommended!",
          "14 Euros for an amazing Museum. Great Value. The history of this place is incredible and what the Leaders of Monaco have tried to do for decades to save the plant and ocean is inspirational and impressive. Jacques Cousteau was Director of this Museum for 30 years. Really nice",
          "The displays are good but not exceptional, this place is a bit over-rated in my opinion and could do some updating, don't go if you have already visited Deep Sea World in UK!!!",
          "The aquarium attracts large crowds even out of season and, as a result, it is difficult to fully appreciate the fish etc - but, combined with the historical collections upstairs, this is a place that should not be missed",
          "Too expensive for this type of attraction, the aquariums are old and not suitable for too many visitors, I don't recommend if it's a rainy day...",
          "We were at the aquarium in mid April. The crowds were minimal. Admission for two was 26 Euros. The Monaco bus (No1&2) pass to get there is obtainable either on board from the driver for 2euros or at the ticket machine for 1.5 euros. The aquarium initially accessed by a steel set",
          "If you have already visited Deep Sea World in the UK, you probably won't be blown away by the tanks at this museum, although the jelly fish were strangely hypnotic to watch, and there's a nice big tank with colourful tropical fish. I visited off season on a sunny day, but even",
          "Came here with a 10 year old and 12 year old and they were suitably entertained. Lots of fish to see in the basement but after that it\u2019s more historical. Spent majority of our time in the basement and the top floor is basically a restaurant with a small turtle pen. Worth while",
          "I did not know the museum existed until I went there with some freinds. Athough it i clearly old that just adds to the charm of the experience. We hired a guide and he was so knowledgeable and spoke very good English. It was fascinating to learn about how one of the early",
          "This Aquarium is a great place to visit while in the area of the palace while in Monaco... to get to the Aquarium itself is quite a long walk up a rather steep hill. Apart from that there are many amusing creatures here and is definitely one of the best Aquariums in the world!",
          "Super museum with huge aquariums with a great variety of sea life on show (downstairs). There is also a natural and general museum on level 1&2 that are pretty interesting. Not world class but very good. Level 3 has a reasonable panoramic view of Monaco and restaurant. The",
          "This museum requires an extensive visit; it has so much to offer. We watched documentaries, visited the oceanic displays. Amazing!",
          "I'm not fond of animals in zoos etc but the aquaria here seemed large enough to give the fish a decent space. The views of the fish are spectacular and one could see the fish in great detail.",
          "Nice to visit and see the aquarium but an awful experience in the gift shop with children pushing in the queue and counter assistant not on top of her job. As you leave you have mixed feelings of frustration - maybe a one off but puts me off going back",
          "This aquarium is far better than any other I have visited. For a start the building had an incredible artistic design with the perfect location right on top of the sea! The inside was perfectly layered out with signs directing you to different species and locations (such as",
          "In most cases I don't agree in confining animals in zoos and aquariums so chose not to go inside but the exterior of this huge building is so impressive. The external features and sculptures all link to the sea.",
          "Monaco Oceanographic Museum A jewel, the best of the best, nature, preservation, histories, legacy, spectacular displays and vision of the future.",
          "The building itself deserves the visit! The aquarium, the part with the fossils and the rooftop make the place unique and a must go! For adults, the ticket costs 11 euros. If you are around, go visit!",
          "Cheap place to visit in Monaco, being only 10 euros.... they have various different displays of fish including sharks, jellyfish, axotl, sea turtles, sea horses and plenty more! Plenty more to see here, including a museum on the upper floors of various skeletons of whales etc",
          "Very large aquarium with so much to see! The service was not that great but otherwise it was a great experience. Would recommend!",
          "The Oceanographic Museum is really nice, though not as impressive as some other aquariums in Europe. worth visiting after you've experienced Monaco",
          "Nice place has the museum attached to it which is nice was only 9 euro for an adult which I thought was good and the Monaco hop on/ off takes you straight there ! Worth visiting",
          "I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this museum. I never enjoy aquariums, normally getting rather queezy from looking through glass. This was a wonderful experience. We got a late start, arriving in Monaco at about 12:00. We used the Parking du Chemin des Pecheurs, where",
          "Great day tour! If it is rainy it is a great excursion with kids and family! I recommend it because of the very educational aspect of the tour while enjoying the time.",
          "The Oceanographic Museum, is built into the rock on the sea. A multi level building with fantastic displays inside.",
          "I enjoyed the visit, the location is incredible and the building itself is worth seeing. The view on the sea is so amazing that I didn\u2019t understand why some windows were blinded. There are two things that I noted. It\u2019s not very easy to circulate when there are many people.",
          "This is an excellent Oceanographic Museum and Aquarium rolled into one. Beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean. Just check out the glass in the Aquarium......Crystal clear! How about that?",
          "A great experience to get the most out of the museum take your time going around, Makes you think of the damage man is doing to the oceans and world in general, very informative and a lovely few hours out.",
          "This is one of the nicest aquarium spaces I have seen. The building has lovely architecture and interior design. The top floor has marvelous city and sea views. The bones and stuffed animal exhibits were well displayed with information for those who were interested in reading",
          "Nice place to visit, worth the money, it's time to relax. There is a little line for the tickets, but not to long, so everybody can just go and buy, nice place to visit in Monaco",
          "Amazing place! A must visit for everyone! Stunning aquariums + many other atractions to see within an incredible building. Just near the palace and the old historical part of Monaco..",
          "A very interesting and astonish tour \"under the sea\", like in Andersens's story - The Little Marmaid. Perfect for your children, amazing for teens, unforgetable for the \"oldies\" who forgot how to be a baby-explorer!",
          "This oceanographic institute was a total surprise on our visit to Monaco. The history and collections are amazing and it is inspiring to know that this institute has been displaying and protecting the oceans since 1906.",
          "its really a once in a lifetime experience but to tell you the truth for me it was double pleasure since I\u00b4ve been there two times , I cannot forget even after a long time has passed already.",
          "I am a member of the Museum, and I get invited to beautiful events there all year long! The museum itself is already so beautiful, but when the summer events are on the beautiful roof with the fantastic view over monaco and the sea, it is each time a great pleasure! Basic",
          "Great place to visit if in Monaco or surrounding areas. \u20ac11 for admission and there is plenty to see while there!",
          "This has to be the most beautiful building housing fish! I was so impressed with the exterior of the building I wish that we had time to go through the museum.",
          "If you are staying in the area, take a day and visit the Principality of Monaco. This tiny city state, 2.020 sq. km., is situated on the French Riviera approximately 20 km from Nice. We caught the train at Cagnes sur Mer because we were staying in Vence, just outside Nice. It",
          "We spent a few hours strolling the Oceanography Museum enjoying its delightful exhibits. It is a family attraction. The upstairs museum is a bonus. To top it all off the rooftop restaurant offers a nice break to enjoy the harbour views and chocolate crepes! There is a nice play",
          "Fascinating museum and aquarium in one stop. Lots to see and explore. Want to take it with you? Visit the gift shop for various options. Lots of photo opportunities too.",
          "We had a short visit to this small but compact museum. The displays were good but not exceptional. An enjoyable tour",
          "We went to visit the museum with parents in their 60s and two children 6 and 10 years. The entire visit took about 3 hours. The approach was through wide and being stairs, in some way easing the effort to climb steep ones for my aged parents. The children of course had fun",
          "The aquarium side of the museum is good, with lots of tank displays and variety, but there are better in the world. However the history and collections of static displays is the highlight for me. The history I found fascinating about the passion of the Prince to establish and",
          "we really enjoyed great aquarium and fish collection in 2 floors downstairs. Nice view from a top of the building.",
          "This museums aquarium is simply the best underwater collection anywhere, without a doubt. The museum was curated by Jacques Cousteau for 35 years and contains some 6000 live species. Fabulous underwater tanks full of exquisite fish, sharks, sea horses, nautilus, on and on, but",
          "Exhibitions change so always worth a repeat visit. Art this time. Fish were as spectacular as ever. Very good value at \u20ac14.",
          "We did the combined ticket with the auto museum, so walked in to have ticket scanned. The lower level is filled with aquariums, some full wall height. The \"sea floor\" life and coral was also fascinating. The upper floor has a number of sea creature skeletons and stuffed",
          "Lovely place to visit. Lots of different aquarium with a wide selection of fish. Upstairs there also a lot so see and the fee is not too expensive. We had a great time there.",
          "Lots of cool looking fish here. Pretty crowded. It\u2019s an aquarium, not really sure what else to say. Smells funny inside.",
          "One of the oldest aquariums , it is a really nice space. The exhibits are well spaced out and engaging. OK , new massive venues with under sea walks etc exhist now and so it is a little dated but still well worth a trip.",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit and the entrance fee is great value for money, lots of lovely colourful displays of marine life and loads to see, the aquarium is in the basement with the upper floors being the museum, there is the usual shop as you exit and a cafe for a drink",
          "Went with my friend and we had a great time. A lot of interesting things. Amazing aquarium. The ticket price is reasonably for what they offer, it's good value for money. I recommend it.",
          "It is a great museum but full of people. At the acquarium part there were a lots of children and small spaces, but at the other floors there were more space and easier access to see everything. There is a beautiful view from the museum terrace.",
          "Adults: 14EUR, Children: 10EUR. There are combined tickets (Adults: 19EUR) to visit the palace and the musuem/aquarium. There was an activity room for kids and lots of wonderful colours and species in the aquarium. Displays are well lit so it seems like the most perfect scuba",
          "This really is a \"must see\" for any visit to Monaco. Not only is it houses up on the rock in a beautiful place but the actual displays of sea life are amazing. Not to mention the museum part with lots of interesting displays and interactive screens explaining the contribution",
          "Amazing variety of exotic living creatures. Beautiful building. Beautiful walk to the building. Wonderful views of Monaco and beyond from the building. Rooftop restaurant and cafe. 100% recommend anyone to visit this museum.",
          "It\u2019s an aquarium, mostly tropical displays. There was however a smaller Mediterranean display. As an aquarium, it\u2019s average to poor, nothing like the Baltimore aquarium...if you were looking for oceanography like I was, this was definitely not oceanographic!",
          "Very good lighshow on the hour, played over the whale skeletons, spooky. Think it was 14euro to get in. Worth it though.",
          "Best aquarium I've been to. Took alot of cool pictures and enjoyed myself for a few hours. Visit if you are in the neighborhood.",
          "spent a rainy afternoon in the museum - it was amazing and enthralling - did not think I would enjoy something like this but really enjoyed it as did my friends and teenage boy who was with us",
          "Spent an hour here. Great exhibition of tropical fish. Worth a visit but an hour is enough. Very clean and tidy",
          "We were very much looking forward to our visit to the oceanography museum that may have inspired so many aquariums and oceanographers. However, we have visited the many others - such as Monterey and the Aquarium of the Pacific - so for us, Monaco's Oceanography Museum wasn't",

          "We visited the aquarium with our kids and we loved it! There are plenty of fish to see and also a nice display upstairs on the dedication of Monaco to preserving the oceans and sea life. Was a highlight of our time in Monaco.",
          "Jacque Cousteau was the director here until 1988. The ocean museum had its 100th birthday in 2010. We should all look that good.

          "We took the bus number 2 from SNCF station to Monaco Ville, the musuem is very close. The musuem has 2 floors of aquarium, 1 floor of ocean collectibles and dinasour remains and top floor for Monaco city view. Overall happy with the experience but the tickets are on the costly",
          "My daughter wanted to visit this site so we entered . It was much better than I would have imagined. We all enjoyed the magnitude of sea life on display here .",
          "I absolutely cannot fault this place. We were in a day trip from Nice and decided to get the combined ticket with the car museum, which reduced the price. It was a bit of a walk from the train station with small children, but the views and sights on the way made it ok. The",
          "We were hiking around Monte Carlo, and decided to take the \u201cboat taxi\u201d from the Marina to the Oceanographic Museum. One can get there via bus, or boat taxi, but if you use the boat taxi it is a a bit of steep walk up to the Museum. The displays are spread out over four",
          "I would have given 3.5 out of 5 if possible as the exhibits did not disappoint and feeding time with sharks is always bound to excite. There is an expansion under way and that might clinch the extra 1/2 point. The venue calls itself a museum and true there are numerous exhibits",
          "As a lovers of the oceans, this destination was at the top of our Monaco list and it was spectacular! From the location right on the Med, to the gorgeous building and the quality of the marine exhibits, the Oceanographic Museum inspires and teaches the need for mankind to be",
          "This is a magnificent museum and education for everyone that loves the ocean and cares for the future or our oceans and planets. The educational nature of this museum is breath taking in its modernity and simplicity. This is a humbling and thought provoking museum, it is well",
          "Has a number of levels. The aquarium is in the lower levels. Well set out and good information. Other floors have displays of sea life more like the natural history museum in London. Top floor had a restaurant which is not cheep (what is in 'Monaco!) but has killer view.",
          "I echo other reviews when I say we visited on a particularly hot day! This probably made the walk seem longer and more hilly! We visited in the afternoon and didn't have to queue for tickets. Tickets are slightly pricey in my opinion. The aquarium was great, with lots of info",
          "The is a very cool place to visit as the displays and different and very informative Ask for the multi ticket as you can get to see other sites at a discount.. Great free Wifi also",
          "This is defiantly worth a visit - this aquarium/museum is huge and there is lots to see and do here. There are a wide range of exotic fish here. I would recommend buying your tickets before as it does get busy. Just outside they have a tour train that cost \u20ac10 each for a",
          "Good muesum and great presentation of all fishes. Probably the best I have seen till date. Just brilliant! Must go. You will not be disappointed. We had doubts when we were going in because we had seen many but this was far far better. Adults was 16 and kids a bit less. Just",
          "It is a fairly lengthy walk up to the museums but it is well signed, we went on August so the walk was hot. The museum building is beautiful and the old fashioned layout of the exhibits is quaint, though not as engaging as some other museums, there was a lot to read to get the",
          "If I say my young boy kept me in here more than six hours then that is how interesting it was over five levels through lunchtime and beyond. On the food side we compensated with gloriously fruity real pear and peach ice creams..... This is a very educational experience and",
          "If you\u2019ve visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium, you\u2019ve ruined any other ocean museum experience. This was a decent attempt but nothing like Monterey Bay. It is something to do if you are sightseeing and have already lost all you spending money at the casino.",
          "It is a lovely place, with occasional exhibitions and collections. The view from the top of the building is Amazing! Suggested to buy combined ticket with the Prince`s Palace Ticket, it comes to better value (go to the ticket office which is front of the Royal Palace). Cons.:",
          "Collection was quite good. Lots of sharks, different fishes. Some skeletons were there. You can find lots of Nemo there, one dory also.",
          "All you can see from underseas! So much to learn! Years and years of studies and research all kept in this amazing building on the center of the Great Principate of Monaco, France!",
          "My highest recommendation. I have never seen such beautiful sea creatures before. Amazing aquariums with magic atmosphere. It worth to buy one shared ticket for Museum and for palace. It is cheaper together and you will like both places.",
          "Must see if you not on a short rush around Monaco seeing everything in a few hours. Provides a good side attraction to escape the heat. We arrived here via the hop-on-hop off bus. The actual displays are not any different to any other good aquarium but great for kids.",
          "We went on a Saturday around 1430 and it was busy but not overly. There are so many different fish to see and lots of information about them. Great for all ages and definitely value for money. Upstairs is a gathering of typical collectibles from over the years but not my",
          "One of the coolest place to take your kid to. Madly interesting for children and parents both, a lot of activity for kids",
          "This museum should be in in ur must visit list in Monaco, because it is definitely worth it for a visit, they introduce every kind of sea animals in three languages( English French and Italian) It is also a very good place to escape the strong sunshine in August. The museum is",
          "My visit took place around 1pm on 2018/08/14. There were way too many people in the aquarium area. We could barely move. The A/C couldn't keep up, it was too hot and too loud. I have never seen such a badly managed museum in my entire life. I notified the staff there were too",
          "This bustling aquarium was a favourite stop of ours. Beautiful tanks with a fantastic array of colourful fish. The museum is also a fascinating portion of the trip, we really liked the grand building and all of its specimens and models. We arrived on foot in the sunshine and",
          "Wonderful aquarium with digital displays will captivate you, I hope. There are species I have not seen anywhere. The upper floors are great too, telling the story of Prince Albert and his travels and discoveries.",
          "Go for the view of the sea and city from the rooftop, if nothing else. The building is massive but was not actually that much to see and the aquarium part was so crowded with families. I did a quick walk through but expected there to be more exhibits. Liked the gift shop at the",
          "Visited in the summer of 2017. It is a nice museum but i did expect it to be bigger and have more animals there.",
          "Rather crowded and small, but worthwhile to see. It\u2019s a one floor oceanic exhibition of some great species, and educational in terms of selection. They had advertised a big pond underneath the sea with sea turtles, sharks etc but found out it\u2019s the VR Cinema offering this",
          "Definitely worth a visit as there is such a lot to see. Downstairs are the aquariums with all types of fish including a massive tank with sharks and turtles. There is also a touch tank for smaller children. It\u2019s a great venue and the building itself is beautiful and hangs of the",
          "The building itself is a sight, perched on a cliff overlooking the sea. The aquarium is fantastic, full of every species of shark & fish you could think of. The star of the show for my kids were the Piranha`s but the layout is fantastic for kids with plenty of interactive things",
          "A must see if your in Monaco. Was very busy in the afternoon at 15:00. Reasonable price for what it has to offer.",
          "Well, I didn\u2019t know what to expect when visiting this place but.... the Oceanography Museum was out of this world! The aquarium was much better than the London one. Loads of information in multiple languages. Inviting fish tanks and very good groupings of species. Some very",
          "We came here since it\u2019s the location the famous Jacques Cousteau worked. It\u2019s been up dated, however it\u2019s no different from any other acquarium in the region.",
          "Worth the trip if you are there for the day. I recommend approaching via the walkway up from the harbor - some beautiful photo ops on the way up. We purchased the combo tix with the palace tour - worth it. Aquarium home to lots of Jacques Cousteau items - as someone who",

          "I enjoyed the visit to this aquarium as much as My 7 year old and 10 year old loved it. There is much to learn, amazing exhibits and plenty of displays to spend 3 or more hours discovering. Don\u2019t be in a hurry as each display has an interactive explanation with a lot of",

          "Visited in July with family, one the 2 best places to visit in Monaco. The aquarium part is excellent, very modern, fishes presented in nice ways: we liked the little nemo fishes a lot, the medusa, and everyone loves the sharks swimming in a huge aquarium. The museum part is old",
          "There is a lot to see in this museum, it is very interactive and I believe it may be interesting for children and also adults. It is not only about the history of oceanography but you can also visit here an aquarium.",
          "We visited the south of France in July with 4 children. This was by far the highlight of our trip. We easily spent 2-3 hours going through the aquarium and the really near exhibits in the museum. We bought the combined museum and palace tickets but the kids would have been",

          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is well worth visiting if you are at all interested in oceanography. While the aquarium tanks are a big part of the attraction, this is not simply an aquarium destination when compared to places like Ripley's Aquariums. Yes, there are shark",
          "Spent 1-2 hours with my 11 year old son here but soon got annoyed by the crowds. Go in the (early) morning, it\u2019s bound to be less busy. Obviously, it\u2019s dark down there and has poor ventilation so I left with quite the headache. Some very interesting species on display but",
          "This is not an aquarium, it\u2019s an oceanographic museum, so try to keep up. The reason it\u2019s not an aquarium is because the exhibits of sea life in its various habitats are so limited you\u2019d do better at SeaWorld. A huge amount of exhibition space is devoted to whales in what normal",
          "Visited with young children 10 & 7 on a busy July afternoon. Excellent aquarium, good multilingual information boards for each section, good variety of displays. Restaurant & snack bar on top floor with tortoise display & playground. Worth a visit .",

          "We went since theres not much else to do in Monte Carlo. Its a small aquarium but it has lots of different species in pretty small tanks. Its crowded and we had to queu in front of the aquariums to see whats in it. If you feel restless or has children along its a good place to",
          "Very nice, lots of wildlife. Little overcrowded by the chinese people( ooooch), but very educational fot the children. You can see how Cousteau did it in the early days, the old museum shows sculptures from around 1900 and still a food condition. However the children like the",
          "A bit expensive (16-18 euros for a person, as I recall, less for children less than 18 years old), but I can understand the price. The building itself is beautiful, has amazing views and interior, the collection is fascinating, I especially enjoyed the one on the top floor jus",
          "Looking inside out or outside in, the design and drama and views of the Oceanographic Museum wholly reflects the importance of the leadership Monaco gives on the fundamental importance of protecting our Oceans and their inhabitants. A must see on any visit to the Cote D'Azur.",
          "This Museum was the Home of famed undersea explorer Jacque Cousteau. However his research lives on. Ive been to many Aquariums around the world, but this one is by far, one of the best, there are long waiting lines outside, so it is best to buy a ticket online or go with a tour",
          "The shark pool has left the greatest impression, where you can feed live sharks. there was something wow here.",
          "This was a great stop during our visit to Monaco. The building is an architectural gem. The acquarium tanks on the lower floor are filled with a variety of sea life. The baby spotted jellyfish from Australia and the nautilus were my favorite. There are some excellent exhibits on",
          "The building is beautiful and the aquarium totally exceeded my expectations. The main tank is very large and contains a huge shark, turtle and countless other fish/species. All tanjs were beautiful and spotless, appears to be super well kept. Highly recommend it",
          "Walk in and see all those old specimens collected in the days of the gentleman explorer. The museum maintains that wonderful old flavor of museums that displayed specimens preserved in formaldehyde, unique and wonderful items collected from all corners of the world. One room",
          "Take a look on what is going beneath the waves. From seahorses to sharks. There is also alot of history presented. Great for the whole family.",
          "I was a little skeptical about visiting the museum but that skepticism quickly vanished when I saw the gigantic tank with live sharks and other sea creatures. The best viewing of this engineering wonder is from below where you can look up 10 to 15 meters and see these beautiful",
          "We had full day in Monaco, but saw what we wanted to see. Decided to visit Oceanographic Museum. Excellent choice for adult and children alike. Beautiful location in Monaco-Ville, great viewing all varieties of fish. Not really an aquarium guy, but loved this. Also opportunity",
          "I make a point of visiting museums - all over the world. Having had this one on my bucket list for the past 30 years, perhaps I was expecting too much. Methinks it living on past laurels. By today's standards of museum display, this not at all what it should be. Jacques",
          "Really enjoyed! Set out great with many varieties of sea life. Suitable for the whole family. Upstairs skeleton display is excellent!",
          "Visited independently while our ship was in port for the day. This aquarium was absolutely stunning and the variety of fish was astonishing.There was so much to take in and it was a joy to see the turtles, sharks and beautiful fish all swimming along quite happily together. It",
          "The aquatic life exhibits alone are worth the price of admission. But there's also a collection of sea life skeletons and other collected life and an excellent collection of the \"tools of the trade\" circa early 1900s. Also, the view of Monaco from the roof is very good.",
          "Didn\u2019t go inside but this is one spectacular building looking like it is been out of the rock face! Worth a visit without a doubt- bit of a climb but worth it",

          "Although I\u2019ve been in Monaco many times this was my first experience of the museum. There is a wide range of interesting creatures to see in pleasant surroundings with an array of information on what\u2019s displayed. On the upper floors the exhibits give you an insight on the",
          "The venue of the place is amazing. A big monumental building on the edge of a cliff. Visit costed 11\u20ac for a student incl. visit to the royal palace. Aquarium was great with the sharks and everything. We saw lots of information and intresting stuff for the kids too! Air condition",
          "We loved the museum. Such a good variety of animals to see and the content is presented really nicely. Great for adults and children!",
          "Sheltering from some unseasonal weather , we visited this remarkable collection and came away most impressed. The building itself is worthy of note overhanging the sea whilst inside the collection features many and varied species of sealife. Spacious rooms and corridors meant",
          "This is our second trip to the museum whilst on a trip to Monaco and highly recommend. It is is well maintained, in a spectacular position and the displays are informative and interesting. The children (and adults!) really enjoyed visiting here, an enjoyable place to come.",
          "A good mixture of things to see from an aquarium displaying jellyfish and sharks to skeletons of whales and dolphins.",
          "Does not have to be the biggest ,but is one of the best taken care off. Excellent species, well preserved, and a lot of history Jacques Cousteau famous oceanographer is part of it.Nice Evening!!",
          "The exhibits here are spectacular!!!! You can see thousands of fish types in more or less natural habitats - as natural as you can get for being in a large glass enclosed tank. The non-fish exhibits are neat bits of history to pique your curiosity. The elevator may be somewhat",
          "We only ended up here as it was raining. Not really my thing but was pleasantly surprised. Excellent displays and the view from the roof is worth a visit.",
          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is one of the best aquariums in Europe. On top of that it is situated in a very beautiful building which claims from its roof one of the best views of Monaco! Especially kids always love it!!",
          "Magnificent architecture and picturesque mosaic floors! Surely a true labour of love to create such beauty! It was a delight to the senses to see the colourful fish and other species of marine life swimming around and gliding passed each other with ease. Even the odd looking",
          "The museum is built into the sheer cliff face rising from the sea, quite a feat of engineering! The aquarium is sited in the basement and is home to multitudes of rare fish with lighted displays of living coral. Sharks, rays and moray eels are well represented with the largest",
          "Stopped here on our day trip from Nice. Great way to spend an hour or two. Very well laid out aquarium in the basement. Didn't get to see much of the other floors, but there was a great exhibition of different shades of the oceans from around the world.",
          "We initially thought that as adults there will not be much to engage our interest. But we were proved wrong. We took our time watching the aquarium and then were pleased to see a light, sound and motion show of the exhibits on the top. We were amazed at the species of fish and",
          "Surprisingly good selection of sights inside. Lovely views from the top of the Museum too. Quite bit of Maritime history there as well which I wasnt expecting. Well worth a visit",
          "First to know: the aquarium proper exists at the base of this big, beautiful building, and the space it does occupy is not large. The walkways are not wide and, with a few exceptions, the tank displays are not big. All this means that if you pick the wrong day to visit, as",
          "Wonderful views, a lot of new information a little bit crowded. Very nice species of fishes, I was amazed",
          "We went to visit this attraction and my husband was in the queue fro tickets. I have additional needs and needed to visit the bathroom whilst he was in the queue. I explained this (in French) to the person on the door and showed them the medical card that I have been issued",
          "Unfortunately, due to having blisters we didn't feel up to any more visits to museums etc so we missed what I am led to believe was a good experience, however outside was a 'yellow submarine' for 2 people. Comments on the submarine referring to the Beatles Song. Will definitely",
          "We do think it was worth to visit. A lot to see in a rather small place. Sometimes it can be crowded. Glad we did this.",
          "The cisit of the aquariums is really nice, the kids really enjoyed it. The terrasse on the top floor is also worth a visit with a nice view. The walk around the museum is also nice, up to the palace. The museum has a big diversity and you can touch the fishes if you book it.",
          "very small collection, for adults not worth it. You ll be finish in 15 mins. don't waste your time, its popular because of limited to do in monaco...",
          "As a family we all enjoyed visiting the aquarium. We were there for about 2 hours. The area that it is in is next to the palace with plenty more to see and nice quaint streets with cafes and eateries. Enjoy!",
          "Aquarium's are ten a penny and the Monaco Oceanographic Museum contains nothing exceptional. It is, however, in the most stunning building and it is worth a visit to see the stunning building.",
          "This was a wonderful aquarium/museum. There were lots of little aquariums and not many big ones (but there is one huge one that you could spend a long time at!), but the quality was excellent. The museum is also very interesting, and the rooftop area with restaurant, cafe, small",
          "Before visiting the aquariums, which are small but full of interesting creatures, a visit to the section that recounts the exploration and discoveries made in the early 20th century is most interesting. Not to miss the bathysphere in the entrance!",
          "A great way to spend a couple of hours for adults and kids alike. All the exhibits are interactive and the kids enjoyed using the touch screens to find out more about the animals. The room of artefacts, old photos, skeletons and sea creatures in jars was also really",
          "My family and I recently visited the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco while on holiday in Antibes and I'm so glad we did. The museum is simply world class. What an awesome experience watching sea life in close proximity! And what a variety of fish and other creatures that live in",
          "The Museum is really nice and relaxing, has beautiful and interesting rooms as for example the Whale room. Unfortunately we arrived late at Monaco and consequently at the Museum and didn\u2019t have the chance to visit the Museum completely. Around 18:40 they announced that Museum",
          "Nice for a one and half hour diversion, pleasant and visited for free off season as part of the \u2018Passport to Monaco\u2019 deal which is avail off season. Nice but there are better facilities of this type around the world - my advice is if it\u2019s free visit , if not use the money for",
          "Spent about 2 hours here exploring the tanks and museum, beautiful building on the coast and stunning fish and exhibits. Will definitely keep anyone of any age occupied for the time of the visit. About 10 Euro entry (not sure as had free tickets) but worth the money you would",
          "We came here easter weekend so it was rather packed with masses of children but it was good. The exhibits were good and the aquarium was well set out. The building itself is amazing built into the rock face. The views from the roof terrace were great. An enjoyable visit.",
          "The museum is special really special. You have to see it to believe it. Allow 2 hours for visit. So many beautiful underwater tanks full of the delights of the ocean,sharks and unusual fish species. The upper floors house collections of fish and fossils etc. A must do in",
          "Great view inside and out. Great fish and information and history. Building is super cool and grab some lunch on roof.",
          "Visited this Museum on a rainy day so no chance enjoy the view from the roof but the exhibits are great. A must visit place for Monaco for me.",
          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is a fantastic, diverse museum and is beautifully curated. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The lower levels consist of an intimate yet stimulating Aquarium, whilst the upper levels contain the oceanographic museum, including replicas of historic",
          "Took us about an hour to do the whole thing, lots of different fishes/sharks in a huge tank - nice day out especially for younger ones",
          "I see a lot of reviewers complaining about the small size of this aquarium, but it's important to remember that this is an Oceanographic museum first and foremost so the majority of the exhibits are actually focused on the history of ocean-study. This includes boat and submarine",
          "There\u2019s was a lot to see here including the beauty of the museum itself! Well curated and had a lot to see from live animals to whale skeletons to antique oceanic equipment. Definitely worth the admission!",
          "We visited the aquarium during our day in Monaco as we had done most things on our itinerary in the morning. There was no line so we were able to buy tickets and head straight in. I thought it was a good aquarium with both big and small exhibits with good explanations of the",
          "Had a lovely walk around this magical place, great way to spend a few hours and relax as you learn all about the Ocean.",
          "In addition that the museum is a world class, the actual architecture against the backdrop of the Mediterranean Sea is heart melting! Also be sure to spend time in the Saint-Martin gardens next by, as well as watch a show at the summer cinema on the other side a few stairs",
          "Yes, it\u2019s an amazing sight, but the displays are so close together and cramped! My children were quite upset by how little the space was for sea creatures in their unnatural environment. It\u2019s not very friendly on the pocket either!",
          "The mus\u00e9e is located near the Palace which is a plus as one can visit many sights at once. The entrance fee is too high for what is inside though. Having visited aquariums and exhibits of this kind the world over, I found basics, like a brochure explaining what was where,",
          "We went here on a rainy Saturday afternoon and weren't disappointed. You can go around the entire place within an hour, so maybe a bit pricey. However it is very colourful and has beautiful sea life.",
          "We really enjoyed ourselves in this marvelous underwater world. Sharks, octopus, crabs, seaurchins, jellyfish and fishes from all over the world. Takealook at this place especially if you have children with you. Trust me it will be your best gateway!",
          "This was a nice aquarium, surprisingly good for such a small place. Lots to see, great selection of creatures and information.",
          "Amazing and worth seeing!! Absolutely gorgeous and definitely worth it. Able to take lots of pictures.",
          "The Aquarium and its museum galleries offer one of the richest experiences of the sea through an expansive collection of sketches, models, studies and fish varieties . You should definitely visit it!",
          "Unless it is pouring with rain outside I wouldn't bother. The displays of fish are on the ground floor. Compared to other aquariums around the world this is quite poor re the displays. Most of the tanks seem far too small for the amount of fish or size of fish in them.",
          "We went to the museum to check out what kind of displays they would have and were not disappointed. I particularly liked the displays of underwater exploration gear through the years and the specimens collected in the early 20th Century. There are plenty of live aquatic displays",
          "We truly enjoyed our visit to the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The tanks were well kept, and there was a large variety of very healthy and colorful fish to view. There were many families and children lingering at each of the tanks. The preserved specimens in the museum",
          "In short, it is a place worth visiting, as it has a lot of interesting and fun things to be seen. Interactive, highly enjoyable, and educational, particularly for kids.",
          "It is a must in Monaco. You can visit bigger, better, newer oceanographic museums around the world, but this old iconic museum has a feeling of its own. You can combine the visit to the museum with that to the palace and... here you are! One whole day covered!",
          "Nice place !!! You will discover the wonders of the sea which Principalty of Monaco help to preserve. It is so refreshing to get there, you jump in a wonderfull world and you feel much better.",
          "We visited the Museum as an escape from the rain (yes, it does rain in Monaco!) and we were not disappointed by the displays. All the fish appeared in good health and the large tank where you can sit and watch the sharks, turtles and plethora of fish swimming around is",
          "Honestly speaking we were not aware about the presence of the museum when we visited Monaco, we found it occasionally walking in the upper part of the city. The museum has to lower levels, where there are the pools with all the fishes, the variety and the quantity are very high,",
          "I am not the biggest fan of the ocean because the idea of something swimming up to me kind of freaks me out. It is cool to see all the creatures and the devices people have used through the years to better explore and understand.",
          "While I expected the aquarium to be a little bigger, it was a great place to visit for an hour or so. Definitely worth a visit, if you have time to spare",
          "Quite impressive with good parts and areas for all ages. Large play area for kids on the roof. Nice old building.",
          "The Aquarium on the lower levels is great. It is well maintained, the fish look happy, and there's a decent variety. The museum on the second floor is interesting. It feels like someone raided Jacques Cousteau's home and put everything on display. It's interesting stuff but not",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon here exploring We started at the top floor and worked our way down which meant we saw the museum part first and finished with the excellent aquarium. I was extremely surprised how large the exhibit was, and felt the information screens at each",
          "After watching The Changing of The Guards at The Palace we took the short walk to this museum. What a fantastic building. Inside you walk downstairs to a really spectacular aquarium. Then upstairs to a historical area and then up to the roof terrace where there is a restaurant",
          "The basement section of the museum houses a great number of aquariums containing the oddest and most amazing sea creatures imaginable that swim right past you. The well-chosen lighting combinations highlight that which is shown spectacularly. Adults of all ages who normally",
          "Loved looking at the aquariums, really well showcased . Good value for money. Interesting displays with English translations",
          "My husband wanted to visit, and whilst I appreciate the beauty of the building I hate seeing dead, stuffed birds/fish etc in cabinets. Also felt some of the fish in the aquarium were really squashed in too small a tank, especially the octopus and lobster. I\u2019d have loved to",
          "If you got time in Monaco and sea science interest you this could be a place to visit. Had an museum of the expedition the Prince Albert 1 made back in the old days, art of the sea and an aquarium. The building was gorgeous constructed.",
          "We visited a number of museums throughout our visit, this was by far the best. We purchased adult tickets from the tourist information in Nice which catered for a number of attractions, we paid for children at museum. Displays were relevant, up to date and well maintained. All",
          "This museum does a great job of showcasing a multitude of exotic sea life. It all started when Albert I hired Jacques Cousteau to help build the aquarium in the very early 1900\u2019s. This place is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Amazing location os museum! Very beautiful, always nice to come back with children of without. Aquarium of two floors really beautiful. Other 3 floors more educational with museum. On the top floor bar have nice food and drinks with amazing view of All Monaco. Recommend to any",
          "Lovely museum with interesting sights and facts. Spent around 3 hours walking through the different areas. Lovely views from the outdoor deck at the top. Aquarium is gorgeous!",
          "Whether you are into the natural world or not this is a must see place. Well laid out for viewing every imaginable species of marine life and so much information. Also a good museum in the same building and a rooftop view of Monaco to die for. Plus good food at a reasonable",
          "We popped to monaco for the day before our evening flight home and decided to give this a go, really easy transport from the train station, just hop on the number 2 outside the station and it takes you to the monaco ville which is then a 2 minute walk to the aquarium. Good price",
          "This was a great place to visit, We really enjoyed the history behind the aquarium and all the artifacts in the building",
          "The museum is avoidable specially keeping in mind that there are many other things to do in Monte Carlo. The only positive of the visit was the location of the museum was the location (by the sea) and the roof top restaurant which is good for a relaxed afternoon lunch",
          "An incredible experience, this well designed presentation is a treat. The larger sea life is shown in huge tanks, and the smaller seahorses and jelly fish are presented in an up-close manner with variable lighting offering a unique experience. Not well sign posted, the location",
          "There's a yellow submarine outside the museum and evokes the beatles song! It was so cute and while on the tour we stood outside to sing the tune. The building itself is gorgeous and huge and oh so clean. Nothing in Monaco seems to see any dirt! Wish we would have had time",
          "I\u2019ve developped the habit of visiting the Museum almost every year for the past 15 years. I can say with certainty that it has never stopped surprising me. Over the years, Monaco keeps investing its time and energy in this beautiful structure, which is for me the best museum in",
          "Nipped in here on the off chance and it was just brilliant. The building itself just looks great and as son as you get inside there's a large sculpture of a tree ahead of some huge shelving with jars of nautical things in. The aquarium is large with the centre piece being a huge",
          "Compared very well to some of the best aquariums around the world. Wanted to buy a lot more souvenirs but staff was to rude and disrespectful to give them my money.",
          "If you are in Monaco, you simply must visit this place. Provides great insight in Monaco's strong engagement in and support of oceanographic exploration and the imperative of ocean conservation. Fabulous exhibits and an amazing rooftop terrace with views of the Mediterranean and",
          "We did not visit the museum part of the attraction, just the aquarium, as my mum was getting tired. But even just the aquarium is plenty to see. The Musee Oceanographique de Monaco is not a world-renouned attraction for nothing. From huge sharks to tiny seahorses, there is",
          "Perched on top of the cliffs in an impressive building it provides an excellent insight to the oceans and oceanography along with a spectacular aquarium, with plenty of multilingual interactive services. A trip to the roof terrace gives some spectacular views. Well worth a",
          "If you or your family like aquariums or memorabilia about the ocean, this is the place. It's a lovely aquarium, not massive but big enough. Each tank has digital display info in a variety of languages to learn about the fish and creatures you see. There are 5 floors, the lower 2",
          "Beautiful building with a fantastic view. nice aquarium with separate fish-tanks according fish's grouping. Must be visited.",
          "Monaco...oceanography...Jacques Cousteau! Well, err not exactly and, if you're expecting to learn about Cousteau's work you'll be disappointed - they have his yellow submarine and his name is on the list of past directors inside the door but that's about it. Also, if they are",
          "One of the best experiences. Perfect for sea lovers, nature lovers or just people who want to explore more. The building is amazing, the history presented in the museum unique.",
          "Nice to visit as it is next door to the Prince palace. The aquarium is small but interesting. The museum is not intended to the neophytes. A few minutes away walk from the palace thru a nice park with great views of the marinas, the town, etc...",
          "Small and simple museum and aquarium. Nothing really interesting. But for little Monaco I think it's enough",
          "Oceanographic Museum is a very interesting place, first for its history being created by one of its princes, Prince Albert and also had Jacques Cousteau as Director ! Architecture is beautiful and most interesting is see how Museum was built in a cliff. Aquarium is wonderful",
          "It is one of the best aquariums i have been. So many unusual species which I haven't seen before. Well presented. Strongly recommend it.",
          "Nice aquariums with different species, best of all for me aquarium with hunderds of clauns fish \"NEMO\", i could site there and relax forever. I expected it to be bigger. Price included in Riviera pass. Dont forget to make photo with shark on the roof :)",
          "The experience and money are worth it here. There are about four floors in the building, with amazing exhibit showcases, not only living marines but also specimens.",
          "We had a great time in it like 2 big kids:)) Very informative and very well displayed. Sharks were our favourite!",
          "An amazing collection of oceanographic memorabilia, specimens and information. The aquariums are filled with exotic fish and creatures and if that isn\u2019t enough then the building alone will impress. Well worth the effort of traipsing up the hill passing the palace as you go.",
          "We were very impressed by both the six story building and the viewing tanks of Mediterranean and coral reef fishes. Use the elevator and save your knees.",
          "This wonderful building is in two halves. The first and better half is the stunning aquaria that make up the bottom two floors of the building and which house some spectacular creatures. This element alone is well worth the entrance fee. The other half of the building is a",
          "This was actually built by a Prince of Monaco to study the ocean. There are many fish preserved from the early 1900's along the walls. I purchased a combination ticket of the Palace Tour and this Museum. The total cost was 19 EUR for both. I am not sure exactly what the prices",
          "The kids really wanted to visit here so we did. Prices were high considering what you saw. Very very busy and adults were not considerate toward children wanting to see. Not much to look at although our children were happy and I'm glad it didn't take too long to go through I",
          "Enjoyed the aquarium on the ground floor and the museums on the upper floors. Impressive exterior of building. Had lunch on the rooftop. Wonderful views of the port and city.",
          "The museum is very dry and unless you have a real interest in Oceanographic history then probably not worth more than 30 minutes. The aquarium is a different story! A fantastic array of dazzling fish in a very well thought out display. I would visit again.",
          "Visited this museum in Monaco which I fullheartedly recommend maybe especially when yoy bring kids. The best of all is that the entrance pay is not expensive compared to what you see.",
          "Good range of fish species in a variety of tanks that seemed well maintained. Kind of sad to see a lone loggerhead turtle though.",
          "Save your money! We might have enjoyed it if adequate explanation of the exhibit would have been offered. Unfortunately, we didn't even learn there was a film until we had exited through the gift shop. We were not allowed to re-enter the museum once in the gift shop. Once",
          "Plan an entire day here to see the exhibits. Have lunch in the Oceanographic rooftop cafeteria. Remember to visit the gift shop. Videos come out clearly of the aquarium tanks.",
          "Granddaughter adored this place, she absolutely loved seeing the sharks, the octopus, the jelly fish and sea horses. I thought Nemo and Dory would be the highlights but she hasn't stopped talking about all of the other things she saw. The other floors of this stunning",
          "Loved it!!! Great for all ages. My mother was so happy we visited. The fish were beautiful. Don't miss this in Monaco.",
          "We booked tickets to the Aquarium and didn't book tickets to the palace I now wish we did, we didn't have any kids with us and I have read reviews that say they spent half a day there, I just can not see how !! It's ok it's not great, I expected so much from such a magnificent",
          "We bought a French Riviera pass which included the wonderful museum. The fish and coral displays were amazing. We learnt a lot and enjoyed all the exhibitions. The multitude of clown fish, the jelly fish, the eels and don't miss the light show on the 1st floor...on the hour",
          "On a recent trip to Nice, a visit to Monaco was always going to be a must and having researched attractions, other than the casino/cars etc, this was one, And i can see why. Housed in a fantastic building it houses various vast tanks with all manner of species,A well maintained",
          "We visited this venue during a one day stop in the Principality and enjoyed every minute of it. It is housed in a Baroque inspired building which in itself is impressive but the inside is where the real treasure lies. For us, the massive aquarium and the many smaller ones housed",
          "Went here mostly because of the shark pool and it was great!. But because we were not so into all the other things, the price of 16 euros was quite a lot in my opinion. On the other hand I understand that it costs a lot of money to keep everything in order. Views from the upper",
          "We took the train from Nice (only buy a one way ticket if you are unsure of your return time) once in Monaco (about 20 mins) walk outside saint devote exit and catch bus ( very frequent) ask for the Oceanic Museum. When you get off the bus the museum is very close by. Buy a",
          "At 14 euro per adult a tad pricey but our kids under 2 were free , Not buggy friendly at all, had to carry stroller up steps while staff looked on. Aquarium was nice but again they might think about making them floor to ceiling so the kids could view easier. Didn't go to",
          "This is impressive from the outside inwards. It's a big building which allows plenty of space to build some fantastic displays of all types of marine life. Don't rush it. Take your time and appreciate the amount of effort and care that has gone into achieving this level of",
          "Everyone who visits Monaco should see the oceanographic museum. A really nice building that has a aquarium with a big number of sea species and also two floors that you will learn and see everything that discovered zak yves cousteau. A big collection of animal species, photos,",
          "Read and heard rave reviews about this place. Bit underwhelmed to be honest. Aquarium part same as any other. History bit is okay..... Views from roof are nice.",
          "My wife and I are used to visit Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique de Monaco everytime we are staying in this beautiful city. As always, we came and enjoyed our stay with this little visit made in August 2017, have a look to the photos I'll post, in order for you to see how it looks like",
          "If you've been to some of the big name aquariums in the U.S. or the world, such as the Georgia Aquarium, National Aquarium in Baltimore, and/or Monterey Bay Aquarium, you will likely be disappointed here (unless you are a big-time aquarium/marine life exhibit enthusiast).",
          "Somehow my son felt in love with this museum 10 years ago and now- every year we are coming back - somehow it already feels like obligation to visit our \"fish family\". For adults it is really great to visit this museum once, for kids and probably not kids anymore it is something",
          "We heard about this place everywhere and it was in our to do list while staying in Cannes. So we took a train to Monaco to see the museum. It was pretty small aquarium with fishes and just one floor, so the rest 2 floors was with some other nor exiting things, like shells,",
          "Not great if you compare it to other aquariums around the world and ridiculously expensive for what it is. If you've frequented the likes of the Dubai aquarium, SEA in Singapore or the Two Oceans in Cape Town then give this one a miss.",
          "We visited in August and we really enjoyed looking at all the different species of fish. Next to each display there is a touch screen and you can choose your language and you can see the information related to that particular fish. The aquariums are located at the bottom",
          "A very nice aquarium with many different spiecies. The museum in it self isnt too interesting though.",
          "Lovely aquarium and especially love the Hawaian fish Humuhumunukunukuapua`a. My daughter is very keen on marine biology and it was certainly a trip worth taking. It's also air conditioned which is a perfect place to be on a scorching August dat. Certainly worth a visit when",
          "I've heard about this Oceanographic Museum everywhere so I decided to visit it. Turns out to be very disappointing. Tickets are overpriced. The aquarium is very small (only one floor made of 3 rooms for fish when the building has 4 giant floors) compared to others and really",
          "This is a very famous Museum that you must visit if you are in Monaco. The building and the way it design looks terrific , most of the creature here are beautiful. I could have spend all day long just to stand there and look at them, what a beautiful....",
          "We did not plan our visit ahead and picked up our tickets immediately. Somewhat crowded, but still worth viewing the impressive assortment and diversity of educational exhibits. Our 11 and 13 year olds both enjoyed it! Yes, perhaps some of the tanks were smaller however you were",
          "This must be one of the best aquarium visitor sites around. The research activities, and the marine protection role are very important.",
          "We enjoyed the time spent at the Museum. The Museum was clean but we also agreed with some of the previous comments about some fish tanks being very small, we felt a bit sad for some of the fish. The building is beautiful, very impressive.",
          "Long queues for everything, toilets are filthy. To many people inside the building (more than fish!). High prices! There are so many better places to go as a family.",
          "Great museum situated on the mythical rock of Monaco.interesting and fun especially for the kids and a nice learning experience for adults,too.The only drawback we had to queue quite long for the tickets.",
          "The museum has an impressive display of marine life and is very informative. Sadly, when crowded, you can barely move from one display to another and the accessibility (for baby strollers) is limited.",
          "This is a very famous museum and if you are in Monaco it's a must see. The building is majestic and the vision that created it is so relevant now. The Aquarium is small and nothing spectacular but the rest of the museum is fascinating. The upper terrace offer amazing views, a",

          "A nice way to spend a morning or afternoon and it's a lovely aquarium. Not as good as many others around the world but pretty good for it's size and location. Nice and cool in there in summer and took lots of photos. There is also a more maritime section upstairs but that is not",
          "We visited the Oceanographic Museum and to be honest even though you do get to see some beautiful fish it was expensive for what it was. It costs 16 Euro each and for what you got I would not suggest that you go",

          "The last thing I thought I would do in the quaint country of Monaco was visit an Aquarium, but it ended up being one of the highlights of our European vacation. What an astounding collection of marine life--sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish and fish like I have never seen before.",

          "The Oceanographic museum has lots to offer for all ages. Clean environment and friendly staff. Everything is in French so it was difficult for us to read about all the different animals but that is to be expected in another country! No complaints!",

          "It was a real treat to come and see all the different types of fish here. The aquarium is very well organised, very clean and there is a lot to see. There is also a museum which is very informative as well. A very nice gift shop too. When we went there was also an art exhibition",
          "The combination of the aquariums and the museum itself is very nice. We have already visited multiple aquariums in Europe and in comparison, the aquariums in the oceanographic museum have a nice setting and are well taken care off. We however had the impression that the tank",
          "Excellent medium sized aquarium with a lot of beautifully coloured fish as well as many local varieties. They are well presented with signs in multiple languages. Steps for smaller children to see but parents did have to do some lifting. The Museum takes up the ground and first",
          "For fourteen euros you get an interesting insight to the origins of the museum. The exhibits both in the aquarium and the museum are well presented and interesting. There's a display of items found 'beneath' the sea which is unusual and a section of preserved items from recent",
          "We visited this attraction as part of a combined ticket which included the Jardin Exotique gardens.This will save you a few euros. The aquarium, although not large has very well presented fish tanks with some very unusual species that we had not come across before. Although we",

          "I love aquariums, and this was no exception. The fish seemed comfortable in their tanks, which is very important to me. There is an opportunity to touch alive sharks, which was exciting. I feel bad for the sharks, but how could I let that chance go away? Many types of",

          "I don't know what I expected when we visited the museum but I have to say it was absolutely amazing. The aquarium area was wonderful. I'm sure children would love it. We combined the visit with a trip to the Palace. It's great value if you by the Combined ticket. 19euros to",
          "This had been built up by some friends as an aquarium rather than a museum. There is a small aquarium portion, but it is mostly a museum.",
          "My husband and I weren't planning on visiting, but after so many of the guide books pointing us here, we thought it would be worth it. It was really busy when we went (Easter weekend!) but this is great for families & for couples to spend a few hours. Just don't get too excited",
          "The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is housed in a beautiful building overlooking the Mediterranean. When I visited in May the building also was the site of an interesting sculpture exhibition, and I imagine that on most visits you will see more than sea life. The aquarium is",

          "great place to spend some time with your family, especially the kids loved the under water world experience.",
          "You don't only get to see marine life but also to admire Monaco's architecture! Getting to the museum was a bit difficult because the GPS doesn't understand you need to park in a parking garage first and then walk to the museum.",
          "My 9-year old absolutely enjoyed this visit. There is a good variety of marine animals from sea anemones to turtles and sharks. There are some very weird specimens, the names of which I don\u2019t recall. The tanks are well arranged. The lighting is dim, allowing a good focus on",
          "The building itself is absolutely stunning and sits atop a hill on the way up to the castle. It can be quite a strenuous walk so would recommend public transport if coming here. The price of admission was 14 Euros each which was fair for what was on offer. Bottom floor (-2) was",
          "I really enjoyed the museum lots to learn about and lots see! Great info and a really cool light show!",
          "Excellent place to go if you visit Monte-Carlo. Good for kids, families and couples too. Very beautiful and clean place.",
          "This was a nice museum however not the most captivating in size or content. It is worth going to kill a few hours, however, be aware it will be over quicker than you think. We ran out of fish/museum quite suddenly.",
          "Usually I visit aquariums in zoo, but for this one, I heard that it's ''must to see it'' when you are in MC. And it worth to visit it. It isn't very spectacular, but far to be boring. It has a lot of various interesting and rare animals.",
          "My husband really wanted to visit the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, i was indifferent. I have to say that i was just as impressed about everything as my husband was. I think the aquarium was the best but the whale skeletons are also pretty amazing. Oh and the baby turtles",
          "We got a pass that granted us entry intp the palace and the acquarium. The acquarium had a lovely collection of aquatic life. Description of it was displayed in French and also in English. Was a very enjoyable time, but not a 'don' t miss' kind of an attraction.",

          "Nice museum in the center of Monaco. Sharks, turtles, piranhas and tropical fish all together. Worth visiting...",
          "I visited this place as a part of a conference in Nice. This was the social event planned by the LOC and we had a great time here. The complete museum was booked for us and it was nice to have private tour. The baby nemos, or baby sharks and baby jellyfishes were the cutest",
          "I really enjoyed to visit this museum.it is great for adults or kids. Is very well organised and you will be completely stunned by the beautiful life see. There is also a restaurant on the top with very good value food and Burford to have a drink outside when it's sunny.I could",
          "Although this may not be the best aquarium in the world, it is definitely worth visiting as it is not that big and hence should not take >1.5 hr even for a leisurely visit.",

          "I loved seeing all of the different species of underwater creatures! I thought this would be a small attraction but it was huge there was so much too see and a museum right next door! The turtles were lovely and the sharks are just something else! And a fair price to see such",
          "This place is really fun. The restaurant is great. Good views. Nice staff. Great fish. I spent a great afternoon here.",
          "The best bit of the museum is definitely the aquarium. The building itself is beautiful and you have to give them credit for the way it was built right into the rock, using every last bit of land. However unless you are really interested in the history of how the sea has been",
          "Found this to be just ok, the access to the museum is bit odd as there is no clear indication for entry. But if you decide to walk then it is a nice walk",
          "I recommend this aquarium, due to it's reasonable pricing and range of aquatic life. However, the other floors currently appear to have work being done and so there are only two floors of 5 that can be accessed and enjoyed properly.",
          "it is nice, but honestly nothing special, and if you've been to the acquarium in Valencia, just leave it!",
          "Very wonderful building with loads of nautical designs in the building itself as well as its exhibits from fish to shells and native sea art, also nice restaurant and views on the roof",

          "It was an ok visit, but not something to wow you. The oceanograph is quite small and with no activities, it is kind of boring. The museum on the 2nd and 3rd floor are as plain as you can imagine. No interaction what so ever. The only aquarium that is bigger is the one with the",

          "This is a visit to the aquarium and museum. All the signs are in French and English. The aquarium in my opinion is the best part with beautiful fish to view in many tanks. The museum is more limited but still interesting and tells the story of the princes's collection of",
          "This was a very fun and relaxing time. It was so much more than an aquarium, it was also a great museum and had a nice rooftop restaurant. Very educational and you get to see unique sea life that you can't elsewhere. What I like the most is you can spend as little or much time",
          "Beautifully laid out museum with an aquarium.well worth a visit . Only blot on the visit was the service in the restaurant. We gave up in the end , as did the couple at the next table .",
          "Amazing museum/ aquarium . So many species of fish in lovely displays. Very crowded on Good Friday especially the book store but well worth the visit. Rooftop restaurant was very disappointing.",

          "I visited this museum while I was on a business trip and had some spare time. It was a pleasant surprise to see that the quality of the aquarium was better then expected (i have seen many) The fish seemed very healty and the aquariums are very well taken care off I had a great",
          "This is an excellent aquarium. Plenty of fish from sea horses to sharks. The whole visit takes about 2hrs and the entry fee isn't expensive. We got out ticket at The Palace ticket box both places were included at a discount. Make sure to go around the back of Oceanographic",
          "The Oceanographic museum is worth a visit for the building, alone, but it is truly a gem. The aquarium in the basement was wonderful, with all kinds of colorful fish. But I loved the historic aspects. The diving bell, the maritime artifacts, and the incredible view of the",
          "It is a \"must\" if you come to Monaco, the children love it, l advise all visitors not to miss this opportunity.",
          "We took the train with our children for a short day trip from Nice. We visited both the museum and the palace, and enjoyed both. The aquarium aspect is quite enjoyable - not overtly huge but large enough to have a really good selection of aquatic life/information. The view from",
          "I could've easily spent the whole day there. I will go back for sure next time I am in Monte Carlo. You enter into a world of wonder, very instructive, and fun in the same time.",
          "In a classic area of the city you can find a mix of science and magnifique Explosion of Luxury and beauty",
          "Excellent aquarium but the building is spectacular. The museum is one of the oldest in the world, and built with marine decorations all over.",
          "This was an average aquarium. Not very big with straightforward glass windows for viewing. Even the toddler couldn't get very excited. There is a lovely playground on the roof next to a cafe which was probably the best part.",
          "This is my 3th visit to the museum, its really a must go place for anyone visiting the area. Beside the permanent exibits there are temporary onrs that can be fascinating, just few years ago ee experienced one about sharks that was memourable, this time there was the preparation",
          "Absolutely amazing old building that is very spacious inside. One of the best waterlife museums I've been at. They have everything from sharks to crabs to very, very weird fish. The restaurant on the top of the building has an incredible view over the ocean and the city. -",

          "Small but still a really nice place to visit. The kids will love it. All types of marine life that are well organised. Also the views from the top are nice. Not the biggest but still fun. I would recommend it if you have a few hours and love the oceans.",
          "Unique collection of both large and small fishes. Fishes of size of ants can also be seen here. The museum inside the building is average and not a much of attraction though. The building facade is beautiful and sea view to the back side of the building is picturesque. They",

          "The building that houses this aquarium is huge and beautiful, as are many of the buildings in Monaco. However, I was a little disappointed in the aquarium. The collection of fish was not as spectacular as I've seen in other places and the water seemed to have a slight cloudiness",
          "A building of importance and gorgeous from the moment you arrive. Easy to get to via the steps from the port or from the main shopping street. You may get the hop on tour as well. A good day out for all.",

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series.

The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo.

The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentOfficial Government Portal\nOfficial website of the Prince's Palace of Monaco\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\nMonaco Statistics Pocket \u2013 Edition 2014General information\"Monaco\".

I liked the fact that there were cars and car manufacturers that are so rare, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find them anywhere else. Although I\u2019m not a fan of rallying, I did find the",
          "I don't think I can add anything to all previous reviews but maybe a few practical notes. The collection is housed in a building slightly away from the centre of Monaco, not too far from the palace. However, if you are walking around on a hot sunny day, you may find it a bit far",
          "Some 100 antique cars, carriages, motorcycles and formula 1 cars. Entry fee is 8 euros and you can take pictures for free. They have a formula 1 simulator which cost 15 euros for 7 minutes. They even have few Ferrari crashed and compacted in a cube shape art work.",

          "Everytime you visit this place you will see something new. They change out the cars on display regularly cause of their vast collection and limited space. If you are a car guy like me you will love a visit. The F1 simulator is a bit expensive though, but that is expected.",

          "It was amusing to se Prince Rainier 3rd's car collection. It was a broader range of cars then I had expected. Well worth the 8 euros in entrance fee. My favourite is the little Fiat 500 Jolly from 1959 with plaited seats <3",
          "So... shortly after driving around the Monaco F1 track in a Citroen C1, we went to see some cars that would be able to do it a lot quicker. Highlights for me were Fernando Alonso\u2019s championship winning Renault, a Lamborghini Coutach and the first ever car to win the monaco grand",
          "If you love racing cars, vintage cars, or a tonne of motoring memorabilia, this place is for you. \u20ac8 entry on itself, or get a combined ticket with the palace and oceanographic museum included. Budget about an hour for this museum. The fact it's a private collection does make",

          "We battled a little to find it, eventually asking an extremely polite local. He accompanied us up a lift and through a shopping centre and out again. There it was quiet and away from the crowds. There were no queues and during the hour or so that we visited, I think there were",

          "The entrance could be combined with the Oceanographic museum for \u20ac18. This also meant no line at the other museum/aquarium. One just goes and has ticket scanned at entrance. The car museum was fantastic. Immediately on entering, you know that the place is special. Most cars",

          "There is a car from every era here. If you ever want to view a formula 1 car, you are at the right address here. There are also a number of beautiful cars from the past. For modern sports cars you better off outside.",

          "A really great collection of old and new cars! Would recommend spending an hour here with the family.",
          "This is a short walk from the rail station (make sure you take the Fontvielle exit to the south) rather than the Monte Carlo exit to the north.) With an entry fee of 6.50Euros its excellent value but do not think of this as a museum. I saw a few negative reviews about being a",
          "The exhibition of HSH The Prince of Monaco's vintage contains 100 classic cars of all times, european and american and is opened daily from 10 to 6 pm. We were thrilled by the beauty of those cars, one of them real jewels !",
          "As a car nut myself, this place was on my list of places to visit while I was in Monaco for a day. It definitely didn\u2019t disappoint! Entry to the collection was reasonably priced. I paid \u20ac6.50 if I remember correctly. Inside, you will see countless rare and exotic cars. From F1",
          "I am not particularly a car enthusiast, but this was a very interesting collection well presented. From the earliest horse and buggies and harnesses, to vintage gorgeous cars and racing cars so associated with Grand Prix of Monaco, there was something of interest for everyone.",
          "The collection is close to the Prince's Palace, a great variety of ancient and modern rarities. You are allowed to take photos. Spacious air-conditioned area where you can learn a bit of a history, enjoy the exhibits and get a simulation ride (at additional cost). My son said",
          "Not all cars have signs to tell you what they are, and a little more about the history of each wouldn\u2019t go a miss...but it is a very interesting and worthwhile trip",
          "Interesting museum located in Fontvieille that supports different genres of the automobile industry. From horse carriers over the first automobiles to the grand luxury cars of the 20's and 30's and bigger is better style of the USA just after WW2. In a different room you'll",

          "Enjoyed our visit here. Not too expensive 6\u20aceach and not too big a museum. Some beautiful and rare cars and carriages. Not much information about each car given. Would have been better with more explanation for each of the cars. However worth a visit if you\u2019re into lovely cars.",
          "If you are into cars, then worth a visit. 12 Euro entry fee, so reasonable. It is not huge, but some very nice cars, particularly the F1 Brabham Repco. Pity, the gift shop did not have a book on the museum!",

          "As you enter, a giant wall poster of Steve McQueen sits behind his Porsche racing car. I was sold right there, but then. In a nicely spread out exhibit were some of the most beautiful cars ever built. Also a lot of formula racing cars are displayed along with other cars that",
          "Visted the car museum and if you are interseted in big cars that have been used by princes and the royal family this is the place",
          "This is our second visit and we were not disappointed. Cars had changed a little, but that holds interest and where there once was a grand prix poster display, now this area has a simulated race car experience. You can choose a race track and my son loved the experience. It was",
          "Spent a day in Monaco and my husband noticed this museum on the map. Not easy to find as the signs did not show it but ask somebody who looks local. A very nice man helped us to find it. Best \u20ac5pp in Monaco. You could spend a long time in here admiring all the cars but we just",
          "This was one of the things on our list to do and we were not disappointed. We paid entry to this and to the palace as well. There is a brilliant selection of cars, including F1 cars to Rally cars to classic Ferrari\u2019s and everything else in between Form \u20ac20 you can drive the",
          "If you're a car enthusiast, there's every era of vehicle here to entertain you. From beautiful horse-drawn coaches and antique Rolls-Royce motorcars to a double lane of F1 cars. Of note--if you're a Bugatti fan, the collection includes several examples from the original",
          "A vast variety of cars collection Some exotic cars from classic to modern time Multi car brands, Mercedes Ferrari Lamborghini",
          "WE had intended to visit here anyway but heavy rain made it the ideal place to shelter and while away an hour or so. A quite staggering collection of both vintage and more modern cars from the early 20th century to modern Formula 1 cars as well as some historic coaches. Well",
          "Got there just an hour before close so pretty much had the place to ourselves for the last half hour. I could have spent an hour just looking at the Formula cars.",
          "What an brilliant display of cars through the ages. This is the late Prince Rainier\u2019s personal collection, open to the public in Fontvieille. More than 100 cars ranging from the earliest, including some examples of pre motorised carriages to the most recent super cars (2017 was",
          "This collection is a must see for any car aficionado. It spans multiple decades (starting with literal carriages) and features an impressive number of cars, some of them real rarities and in pristine condition. At the time of my visit the center piece was a Ferrari F50 and it",

          "This private collection runs to about 100 vehicles, big and small, new and antique, well know and exotic, fast and slow. Most of them were gleaming and looked like they had just rolled off the production line. One car looked like the model Grace Kelly rode, driven by Cary Grant",
          "The collection has a good selection of recent F1 cars, sports cars and upmarket cars spanning the 20th century. Whilst the cars are interesting the layout is a bit sterile and the information on each car is not very informative.",

          "The number of cars her is amazing. They are set up perfectly in this Museum. I particularly loved all of the Fords and the 1928 Lincoln there. They were beautiful. If you are in Monaco don't miss this MUST SEE Museum.",
          "A Private Collection as opposed to a Museum, this display of around 100 cars makes easy going, interesting viewing even if you\u2019re little interested in motors. It\u2019s well laid out with minimal reading matter so happily covered within an hour. Started by Prince Rainier III &",

          "This place is unreal, so much more than a museum. This is a live car collection that appears to get used.",
          "Worth a look around when in Monaco. You can get a combo ticket with the nearby zoo for \u20ac9.50. Mostly vintage cars but a some supercars and older F1 cars",

          "Have been looking at cars for years with my husband. He loves them. I don\u2019t this museum was a great compromise. The cars exhibited were so cool and unique even I was impressed. Many were gifts from famous people. One of my favorites was the same model Grace Kelly rode driven by",
          "Although I am not particularly interested in cars, I found the collection of 100 cars old and new just enough to hold my interest. It would have been nice if there had been a little more history written about the individual cars rather than age, model etc. During our stay and",

          "Being more of a motorbike man I was reluctant to visit another collection of cars but succumbed to pressure from my wife. I have to admit that this collection should not be missed, from the 2017 Bugatti Veyron at the entrance to the historic royal horse carriages this display",

          "Great car collection. If you are even a little petrolhead, I recommend to visit this exhibition. Get to see really old cars all the way to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen Formula 1 car.",
          "Go here to see lots of excellent condition vintage (and some more contemporary) cars. There were a lot of cars in this museum. This place is great, even for non car lovers.",
          "I was hoping to take some photos of the classic supercars located in the collection. There were some amazing car legends such as a Ferrari F50, Mercedes 300SL Gullwing and Lamborghini Miura. To our surprise, we couldn\u2019t find the black LaFerrari and the SLR Stirling Moss. It\u2019s",
          "This place is absolutely worth a visit; you will be amazed by the huge collection of old cars (some of them very old dating back from 1904) and modern F1 cars. Price was also very reasonable(6 \u20ac per adult), so I would highly recommed it to anyone visiting Monaco.",
          "Unexpectedly, this was an excellent museum to visit. We really had no intention of touring the museum, but the exhibition of the Prince\u2019s vintage car collection was part of a combination ticket with the Royal Palace. The exhibition brings together over 100 classic cars of all",
          "Having visited many car collections throughout the world the collection here in Monaco is a welcome addition. It was especially enjoyable as a racing fan to see the previous F1 cars of Hamilton and Raikkonen. Great inexpensive way to enjoy a few hours in Monaco.",
          "Had high hopes, and my son had been planning his visit for about a year. The one car he'd wanted to see - a rare Mercedes - was not there, despite appearing on the ticket. The display information was limited and unimaginative and the decor was dated, or absent altogether. In",

          "So much history of the motor car, seeing the cars that were around in my youth and the fantastically maintained variety of cars. The contributors that are displaying their cars must be thanked for making it such a wonderful visit.",
          "We had a joint ticket for both the Prices\u2019 Palais and the Cars, excellent value , but you had to go to them both in the same day. There were so many different cars from different eras from veteran cars of the late 19th century to modern luxury sports cars such Ferrari\u2019s . There",
          "On a day trip to Monaco, we took a trip to this marvellous automotive collection. It is so worthwhile whether you are a \u201cpetrolhead\u201d or not. The vehicles are stunning. Everything from 19th century horse drawn carriages to F1 cars. It is so easily laid out that you see everything",
          "The car collection was one of our favourite things we did on our trip. It costs about \u20ac6.50 for an adult, and you can spend as much or as little time as you like. We took almost an hour, but could have easily spent much longer. You can literally stand inches away from some of",
          "As others mentioned, it's a good deal to buy a combined ticket for the car collection and the palace. We spent over an hour and a half wandering around the three floors of collections. There is a placard providing car make and year but would have enjoyed much more information",
          "I bought a combination ticket to the palace and car collection and was glad I did. This fascinating collection of cars extends from the earliest days of automobiles (including an early motorcycle) right up to modern race cars. The cars are beautifully presented and maintained.",
          "Amazed by the size and quality of the collection and we both enjoyed it very much. It would be helpful to have some more info about each car rather than just the model and year. Though Luckily my hubby knows quite a bit about cars and managed to talk me through.",
          "An impressive and extensive collection of cars, a notice inside tells you that it is not a museum, just a private collection which happens to be on display. Well, it\u2019s certainly some private collection! The entrance price is a very reasonable \u20ac6 or so, or even less if combined",
          "I'm not really into cars, but I found wandering through this collection to be a well spent half hour. Enough cars to make it worthwhile and a good break from the sun if needed. Includes carriages from 1780s through to relatively modern F1 cars. Lots of classics in fantastic",

          "Great way to spend an hour. You do not even need to be a petrol head to enjoy. So many formula 1 cars to see.",
          "My mother and I loved seeing the cars in this museum. My mother was keen to tell me which ones people in her town drove in the 70s and 80s. A really interesting and worthwhile visit.",
          "On a recent visit to Nice last month a visit to the unbelievable Monte Carlo/Monaco was always going to be on the list and this was always going to be on my list of things to do. You can purchase a ticket at the Aquarium which gives a slight discount and access to both",
          "I must say we went here, because I was sure my husband would like it a lot. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it! So beautiful old cars! I especially loved the strawberry red Mercedes Benz from 1956. And the car Grace Kelly and Cary Grant were driving in the movie \"To catch a",
          "We got dropped off by boat at the small port and came across the car collection - decided we may go in on our return.We first went up to visit the palace and there bought a dual ticket for \u20ac11.50 which meant entry to the car collection only \u20ac3.50 and \u20ac8.00 for the palace.

          "If you are into old cars, this collection will truly wow you. I visited this museum (let's call it that) with a friend who has far more knowledge about and interest in cars than I do, and we both really enjoyed this. Luxurious cars, oddities and even polar expedition vehicles,",

          "This museum is a must for any car enthusiast. It's not easy to find but it is worth seeking out. It's within walking distance from the Monaco marina and worth the effort for an hour or two of pure nostalgia. Probably the best value for 8 euros you are going to get in Monaco.",
          "The amazing car collection shows some very rare and nice cars. The guard told us that there are more than 100 and that all of them are working, which is tremendous given that some cars date back to the beginning of the last century.",
          "Had got free vouchers due to the deal with BA, and it was a good experience seeing the cars. Good collection.",
          "Saw this car collection on our hop on/off bus leaflet and thought we would go and visit. It's just near one of the stops on the bus tour. \u20ac6.50 for entry, BARGAIN! Couldn't believe how many cars are there! It's quite amazing tbh! There's F1 cars that belonged to Lewis",

          "Visited the collection with my 11-year old son on the Saturday of the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, probably the most chaotic weekend of the year in Monaco. Despite that, the museum was virtually deserted when we arrived shortly after opening time. There was no lineup, and what a",
          "I'm not really into cars but I found this collection of antique cars really interesting. They span a couple of centuries and are very varied. I'm not sure who needs 5 Rolls Royces bit it was interesting to see the various types. You get reduced price entry if you have a ticket",
          "This is a very special museum which houses only a portion of the Prince's collection. The gift shop has good F1 racing souvenirs but not one single book about the cars so take lots of photos...We were lucky to be here before the racing season began so the city was gearing up",
          "Prince ranier certainly loved his cars a brilliant collection nice to walk round to get out of sun or rain a reasonable price and area lovely to walk around",

          "I don't know anything about cars, or care much about cars, but we went in for a look and I found it reasonably interesting. I think a car-buff would love it! Tons and tons of cool cars to see.",
          "To set the right expectation, you have to realize that Monaco is a really small town unlike the big cities in France and Europe, and so any attraction you will visit will not be huge. We enjoyed our visit to the museum.",
          "I'm not a car lover by any means but this museum is well worth visiting. It contains the Princes of Monaco's car collection going back to the beginning of motor transport. Cars in excellent condition. Also some old carriages and racing cars. Highly recommended.",

          "This is an incredibly tricky place to find so I have included some pics as landmarks so you can see you are getting close. At 6.50 euro it's an affordable visit. The cars are all laid out comfortably and there is seating scattered around if you just want to sit for a while and",
          "It was nice to see. I'm not too into cars, probably more interesting for a \"car person\". It was not easy to find. We bought the tickets at the ticket center near the palace. The ladies in there gave confusing directions and the signage was not helpful trying to find it.",
          "This was a must stop a bit away from the main areas of Monte Carlo - but an easy trip over in Fontvielle. So many cars (and buggies), it was amazing to see them all in pristine condition. Quite the experience, inexpensive to wonder through and unforgettable. With all the true",

          "Worth the visit for anyone. Large selections of cars from diffent eras. There are also race cars, formula 1 cars, dakar race cars and f1 boat, Even horse carriages. The prince has had a good vision when planning this exhibition. By the way for all you Finnish petrol heads, the",

          "For a few extra Euros you can buy a ticket for this museum when you buy the Guided Royal Palace tour. It is a 10 minute walk away but worth the time to visit. It has all sorts of cars from the horse and carriage era to the fairly current times.",

          "The Exhibition Shows a wide range of cars built during the last 100 years and more. The cars are in a perfect shape and there is enough space to walk through and to watch the cars. Some more informations about the cars would be helpful: who bought them and how were they used.",
          "Amazin car and carriage collection, items related to Monaco\u00b4s royal history. Very rare items (spoiler: an original Ferrari 250 GT California) and properly organized. Not expensive at all, and a short visit, even if you are not staying for long in Monte Carlo. A must do while in",

          "I recommend getting a 2 attraction ticket for this. We got tickets at the door for both the car collection and the oceanographic museum for a cheaper price than doing either stand alone. Everyone will tell you how amazing the collection is - and it is, but what's often",
          "What shall we do, I know let's go to the car museum. As most things in Monaco a short walk from the Fairmont Hotel, what a joy to behold. Right from the Isetta bubble car, to the 300 SL gull winged Merc and everything inbetween. All in pristine concours condition. Ferrari's,",
          "A lovely collection of superb cars in splendid condition. These are not just machines or means of transport, but works of art. Anyone interested in cars and their design, should treat this collection as a priority visit. There are those of us, however, who want to delve rather",
          "This is a truly wonderful collection of cars. We took so many photos. It is laid out really well and has to be seen. The cars have been driven over the years by the Grimaldi Royal family. There is also the car that Prince Albert II rode in when he married Charlotte. Also",
          "Great collection of conveyances in this one relatively small museum. The vehicles are not cluttered and there is plenty of room to get angles for photos. The cars are grouped together nicely so you don't have to go hunt around for anything. We used the public bus to get here and",
          "I love fast cars so I jumped at the chance to visit this place must be over 100 cars various engine size and bhp for the car lovers to drool over. As an f1 fan I love Monaco any ways but the museum has lots of information within to keep me entertained for quite some time.",

          "For car lovers a fantastic collection of cars. Personal favourite was the car driven by Grace Kelly and Cary Grant in To Catch A Thief. But slightly irked by incorrect spellings on some of the plaques. I mean how can you spell Schumacher wrong - even it was only the younger",
          "Wasn't particularly bothered about visiting this 'attraction' as it is situated away from the centre and were only in Monte Carlo for the day.. That would have been a big mistake. A surprisingly broad selection of numerous cars from around the world, dating back to the 19th",
          "We've seen several similar collections but this one has some unique pieces, and every car is in pristine conditions and seems ready to go for a trip on the Riviera. A special tribute to the 300SL convertible displayed in the entrance, a strawberry paint model whose to be",
          "This collection of vehicles is simply astonishing. What a wonderful way to spend half a day, or if you have the time, a whole day. Set on various levels (mainly due to the inclines of Monaco), there is sufficient disabled access via an elevator and a walkway ramp to allow all",
          "I had wanted to visit museum ever since I decided to do a day trip to Monaco. I wasn't disappointed. It was superb. A great collection with everything from horse drawn carriages to Formula One cars. Well laid out and displayed. When I went there weren't very many people there",

          "We went to see the cars and were surprised by how many there are in the collection. As well as racing cars there were a good range of family cars from Bentley's to 2CV's. It was a good trip down memory lane to see some of the old cars but interesting to see the more modern and",
          "Had free tickets as part of our Monaco passport. Worth a visit to see classic cars through the ages. Only takes around 1/2 to 45 mins of your time but if in the area, worth visiting",

          "I am NOT a car person but I was riveted by this collection and enjoyed looking at each and every car. In some ways it is a very idiosyncratic collection of the late Prince Ranier but this only adds to the interest and range of vehicles on display. The museum is beautifully",
          "After our guide learned of our interest in racing and automobiles, she recommended this museum...and we were so glad she did! Beautiful cars, F1 racing cars and memorabilia, Ayrton Senna helmet...I could go on and on but I'll just say that if this interests you...you would be",
          "The Grimaldi car collection is something to see! The collection is in the Fontvieille section of Monaco, close to the Naval Museum, zoo and Carrefour! The collection was the personal property of Prince Rainier, but has been added to/edited in recent years. It contains stunning",
          "Museum not easy to find but well worth the effort. Amazing collection of cars from vintage Rolls Royce, American and European cars to modern F1 racing cars. All cars restored to better than new and are housed in a spacious building. A must to visit if interested in cars.",

          "As a devout petrol head since my early teens I have always taken any opportunity to ogle at cars. This collection in a quiet, air conditioned building, took my breath away. The variety and condition of the cars is sensational, from a Morris Minor, my first car, to a vintage",
          "This is well worth a visit. We were surprised at how many cars there were to see. The cars all have a plaque saying obviously what they are and the year which was fascinating to see how they change over the years. They are, of course, just beautiful cars and immaculate. We",

          "The cars were in immaculate condition but I'm not sure that I agree that these classics should be effectively mothballed -it would be much better to see them on the streets. Lots of F1 cars as you might expect but I find these a bit boring. It is a great collection and you can",

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series. The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15-kilometre (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182-kilometre (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.Monaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping). In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25\u201327 June.\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three separate countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9-kilometre (1.2-mile) swim, 90-kilometre (56-mile) bike ride and 21.1-kilometre (13.1-mile) run.\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco. An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.A municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide. The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.With Formula One Monaco GP it has some supporter series, FIA Formula 2 and Porsche Supercup. It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and other Formula Junior programs. \nFrom 10\u201312 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.,The women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo. There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco, founded in 1994.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language school specializing in business education and operated by the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales (INSEEC) group of schools.\n\n\n== Flag ==\n\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs. Adopted by Monaco on April 4, 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (adopted by Indonesia in August 17, 1945) except for the ratio of height to width.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.\n\n\n== Relations with other countries ==\n\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office.

          "This little square(it is round I think) is a great place to people watch and also to see the latest in luxury cars and even classics. Good food all around, very touristy but not overwhelming. Get out of the casino and enjoy the sunshine.",
          "Unfortunately I was unlucky not to be able to see the front of the Casino as there is work going on and the whole of the front is covered up but!! It makes you go around to the back which is far more picturesque!! I would have missed this had the front not been covered over ...",
          "One must visit Monaco at least once in life time. You can reach Monaco from Nice Airport by car. The roads will zigzag across the shore of Mediterranian Sea. The city's roads are narrow as it is on a Hill. Princess Palace, Maritime Museum, Casino of Monte Carlo, Sea side",
          "This is where you see the fancy super cars parked in front of the hotel and casino. Great place to people watch!",
          "this square is always full of very expensive and luxurious cars, so if you want to feel the richness of this plase, this Square is a must",
          "Unfortunately, the entire area in front of the casino is a massive construction site - several cranes/diggers tearing the place apart. I had hoped to relive some James Bond memories or at least get a glimpse of some high-end autos, but this was not to be.",
          "Monte Carlo beats Las Vegas, hands down! I have never seen such a massive display of wealth in one area. With all the expensive cars and the beautiful landscape and architecture, I was lost in the amazement. The best part was at night when the front of the casino lit up with",
          "Main square in town, where all the rich people walk or drive around in very expensive cars. Gets very crowded during season or when the cruise ships are in port, but offers a lot of pictures opportunity. This location was used in one of the James Bond movie. All the terraces are",
          "Casino Square is an amazing place. It's the central hub of Monte Carlo and you could spend hours here just watching the cars that pass by. Some of the most expensive cars in the world are here. And not just one or two. I also saw some historic and vintage cars.",
          "The iconic Casino square with its elegant looking buildings, manicured gardens and super-expensive cars is out of this world. It looks unreal, like being on a film set. Everything is over the top here. The centre piece is the Casino itself. We were able to enter the lobby of the",
          "This is just a cool place to visit. There are the casinos, obviously, which are great to visit. The grounds are very well tended and the area up the hill has plenty of place to sit and relax and it's also great for people watching. A very busy place, but a nice place to relax",
          "As you\u2019d expect at one of the most affluent square kilometres on earth, the Christmas Decorations are cool. If that doesn\u2019t do it for you then just soak in the atmosphere and admire the Bentleys, Rolls and Lambo\u2019s parked outside the Casino. Always worth a visit at anytime of",
          "Picture Perfect location of affluence . Face to face casinos and nice place to sip a coffee and food . I am visiting this place daily in evening",
          "You will recognise this are from TV and films, nicely kept area, quite a few tourists around too. Great as a photo stop.",
          "This is a very pleasant area in front of the casino. An interesting mirror artwork. Worth walking up and the down the other side of the garden before going in the casino.",
          "The whole area here is great for pictures. Take your time and relax in this little green area in a city/country that are filled with buildings and streets.",
          "One of those iconic places that if you go to Monaco you must go and take a picture and upload it onto your social media. The casino is beautiful, but if you are not gaming, there is not much to see. The area open for public is very small, unless you pay an entrance to go inside",
          "Outside the Casino there is a little Square with a nice fountain,A major Hotel and Restuarants and Shops.A nice area to spend an hour or two",
          "Everyone knows this square and it is a must for any visitor to see it. The view taking in the Casino and the Hotel De Paris with many expensive cars outside is spectacular. The roundabout also has the skymirror on it which gives a different perspective. The square does not do",
          "I love this place. Always different during the events. Also known as the Golden square. There is the famous casino Monte Carlo, the hotel de Paris and cafe de Paris. Really fantastic place with great atmosphere.",
          "You cannot come to Monaco and not at least see the famous Monte-Carlo Casino. I wouldn't pay to go inside the casino as we only had an hour but it was something I totally wanted to see. It was extremely crowded but worth it to see and snap a few pics.",
          "This place is must see if only to view the ostentatious display of wealth on display at most times of the day but particularly in the early evening when the display of supercars cruising around is at its peak. It is worth popping into the casino to see the interior. This is",
          "If you like high-end cars, the valet lot in front of the Grand Casino is a blast. The park itself is pretty, but the attractions here are the casinos...and the cars.",
          "The square is a must see! The Cafe on the square has wonderful outdoor seating and was my favorite place to sit and take in the iconic Monte Carlo Casino during the daytime. The people watching is very entertaining here and some people dress the part. A great place for pics,",
          "We walked up to the Sq and took pictures like the rest of the world that was there, we tried to get a coffee in Cafe de Paris next door but the were too busy to take our order. We had a table right door the Casino, so people watching was the thing to do. MONEY went in and MONEY",
          "Visiting here is fun for observing the dream-like world of the rich and famous. Opulence abounds here, and one can see and feel why Monaco is the playground of the world's wealthiest. Fun for people watching here as well. A relatively new elevator center (maybe a year old) is",
          "If you want to witness the fabulous wealth of Monaco you MUST visit the Square. Watch for the constnat stream of exotic super-cars...every boy's dream to own.",
          "Great spot to watch the posers showing their flash cars. also relax with a cocktail in the Caf\u00e9 Du Paris's outside tables.",
          "If you're into looking at great cars, pretty women, high fashion etc then this is the place to be. Poseurs paradise!",
          "Even before actually entering the Monte Carlo Casino, the panoramic view of its syrroundings is spectacular.",
          "With the Hotel, Casino and Cafe, photo opportunities abound - or just take in the opulence and sit and enjoy.",
          "It's ok, the mirror art is nice, but there are far prettier views in Monaco than this. Go towards the palace. That's where you see true beauty.",
          "A small but perfectly manicured park and fountain. Contemplate the world at the outdoor caf\u00e9 surrounded by Ferraris, a casino dripping in gold and throngs of tourists from everywhere. Along with the casino, the opera is here as are some great restaurants. The cafe's menu is",
          "Casino for the rich and wealthy. Parking available. Have to pay \u20ac19 euros & ID to get in. What more can you say. Casino to either make or loose money",
          "Perfect place for taking pictures. Beautiful garden with benches to have a rest, the biggest Casino in Europe and hotel with gorgeous cars in front of it.",
          "The buildings surrounding the square are all must see attractions- the Casino, Cafe de Paris, Hotel de Paris, designer shops. In front of the hotel the super cars park and people gather to photograph these top-end vehicles. In the centre are several fountains and gardens- a",
          "This is the epitome of the money and lifestyle of the Principality. From the Ferraris and Lamborghinis parked around the square to the designer shops the place smells of money. It is one of the places to see how the other half (or probably 1%) lives. You almost expect Daniel",
          "Banging in the middle of the Principality. Picturesque Casino Monte Carlo. Good for car spotting. People watching if that\u2019s your thing. Can be very crowded people taking pictures videos everywhere. Feels like zombies a lot of people gathering in one area. Visit early morning",
          "It\u2019s worth a stop through the square as you walk about Monaco. There is a great cafe...pricey but good people watching, right next to the casino. There is also a beautiful park if you want some peace and quiet.",
          "Have been before but still impressed with the glamour and history of this area. Great photo op and they have some new props just inside for photos as well.",
          "Beautiful gardens and amazing cars! The area is very busy with people there to see the supercars but when you are there you don't even notice - you are too engrossed in the cars yourself! The dream was to find a Veyron but a Chiron was the next best thing!",
          "It does not take long to view but it's very nice place to take part of bigger walk. Maybe go early if you want to get photos without too many people in it.",
          "It's very busy with tourists that want a selfie in front of the casino, but other than that, it's something to see.",
          "visited monte carlo for a couple of hours. lovely place, but very small so a couple of hours was enough",
          "This area is amazing, the square and the casino. We were amazed by this area from the moment we stepped out of the bus",
          "Monte-Carlo is like visiting a hospital. You can\u2019t walk on the grass at the park, dogs are not allowed. Sterile. Boring. A letdown.",
          "We walked through this square many times. It was an easy place to meet up as everyone can find it. This area is very pretty. You probably can\u2019t miss this place when in Haribo.",
          "Spent a couple of hours here as part of a larger day tour to the old city and Monte Carlo in Monaco. Seeing the Hotel de Paris and Monte Carlo casino were really impressive and bring to life a couple of the James Bond films. There\u2019s not loads of places to eat in the square.",
          "Went here late July early in the morning it was nice as it wasnt busy, worth the walk and the gardens around are beautiful. Great place to see! Come early in the morning so its not too busy.",
          "This was my first time in Monte Carlo. It is certainly a beautiful place - with lovely plantings and scenery. It's VERY expensive, very ritzy, and seemed not that welcoming... though the server at Starbucks was lovely. I am glad our family got to see it but when back in France,",
          "This is a lovely square, in front of the casino, so you just can\u2019t miss it in such a tiny country. Have your cameras at the ready because it is very photogenic. Close by are some wonderful shops! Well worth a stroll.",
          "One must visit the casino square with its beautiful gardens and views down to the harbour. This is a must visit place.",
          "Great site to visit and capture iconic photos of the Casino! The square is beautiful with lots of nice cars around it",
          "This is the \"money shot\" this square encapsulates everything that is Monaco-Monte Carlo. I suggest you try it around 7am when the morning light hits it and you don't have 1000's of people crowding your view. A classy square in a classy part of the world.",
          "Great square surrounded by the famous casino, hotel and cafe. Close to high end shops. The water fountain and mirror view of the casino are brilliant",
          "The area around Casino square has wonderful views, great photo opportunities with the Casino de Monte Carlo in the background which is a beautiful building and the Hotel de Paris at the side. Lovely to see all the cars. Great place to walk around.",
          "If you are visiting the Casino Square, do so before the tourists get there. It gets ridiculously crowded from late morning to late afternoon that we decided not to walk around town. We were staying at the Hotel de Paris and the doormen did not let people who did not have",
          "Stunning and huddle bustle. Beautiful buildings and beautiful people A lovely walk and some great bars and restaurants",
          "Casino square is situated between Hotel de Paris, and Casino de Monte Carlo and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte Carlo. A historic landmark that is symbolic of luxury, wealth and celebrities. There\u2019s cars driving into the square non-stop with almost every luxury and super car",
          "The views of the Casino, hotels and restaurants, plus art work must not be missed if you visit the Square.",
          "If you go to Monaco, you have to go here and just watch. it is beautiful. It is fun and it is grand. And you have to do it.",
          "I went there with my mum,sister and brother the weather was very hot, almost 40 degrees \ud83d\ude0c but we walked anyway for our target \u2764 was very easy to find the way just following the road after the shopping center and you find the begining of the Casino' gardens; going a bit down the",
          "Not sure why, but whenever I visit the area adjacent to the casino, Cafe de Paris and the neighbouring exclusive hotels (Hermitage, Metropole & Hotel de Paris) it reminds me of Disneyland - the immaculately manicured lawns, spotless pavements and fairy tale excess !! Our visit",
          "You have Casino de Monte Carlo on one side and on the other side you have the beautiful shopping center and the restaurant,and branches such as Chanel at the back!! So turn around your head and see what would you like to see.There is a smal botanical garden very beautiful at the",
          "This is the place to see it all. Exotic cars pulled by every minute. From Lambos to Ferraris, Rolls to Bently its the hot spot for people watching and car watching. We were there when the Ferrari Club had an event. 120 Ferrari's were out cruising the streets.",
          "Some really nice and fancy cars around here. Worrying checking out for the beautiful location looking at the mountains.",
          "The square of course is lovely and the cafe de Paris is iconic along with the casino, but to much building work going on taking away the ambience from the place",
          "Some lovely cars parked in the square and you can take photos of the casino and some of the inside but not in the gaming area. It is worth the visit if in the area",
          "Casino square is the heart of Monte Carlo, Monaco. The city literally built around the casino. Yes it\u2019s as James Bond as it gets lol but it is a bit price compare to other areas of Monaco. I think 3-4 nights would be more then enough if don\u2019t have the itch for gambling.",
          "We were visiting the Palace and Cathedral so decided to head over to the Casino. We did not pay the 17 Euros to enter the gambling area but it was fun to do some people watching and luxury car watching around the square. There is a large outside dining area between the main",
          "Beautiful location . A must see in Monaco. An uphill walk from the port, but not too steep. Most buses stop here , as does the tourist train.",
          "It is a very romantic city. We stayed right on the harbour which was accessible to everything. The Port Palace hotel had remarkable service and the breakfast was excellent with a wide variety catering to everyone\u2019s requirements.",
          "The square is pretty and not too far from the railway station or the harbor. There is not much to see so quick visit will be enough.",
          "Take a walk around here and see how many supercars you can spot parked around the fountain. Also provides good views of the casino.",
          "This is the place where you must go if you want to be seen or to see other celebrities. The square itself is nothing special, providing a nice view over the casino and the nearby cafe de Paris. It is a very crowded place, and you don't have much space where you can stand.",
          "One of the best places in Monaco with a beautiful Casino and nice cars. Take the hop on hop off tour and will check that on the nicr places to visit also.",
          "This was one of the busiest place we encountered on our visit to Monte Carlo. Naturally some fantastic cars parked out the front and lots of people taking photos. We were there early January and they still had their winter wonderland theme out the front which made it look",
          "The square works in both ways. Those who have and those who don't. There is complete opulence in the expensive cars and people that drive them or are in them. Then there are the people in the cafes watching them. The buildings surrounding the square are very nice old",
          "My other half loved seeing all the high end cars driving around, the place is a hive of activity - however mostly filled with tourists and people like ourselves looking at all the cars! Very beautiful architecture too.",
          "I wouldn\u2019t classify this as a must see, however if you like flash cars it\u2019s the place to be. Othwise do a lap and discover other places Monaco has to offer.",
          "When the place is dominated by high-rise blocks it is a delight to go to Casino Square and get some flavour of what the place might have been like a few decades ago. The mirror in the fountain is a delight",
          "Gorgeous streets, expensive shops, perfectly green lawns, incredible cars... this place just doesn\u2019t feel like real life. It\u2019s all so perfect it\u2019s like a fairytale. Do not miss walking in these streets and taking in the vibe of this incredible place, imagine the cars buzzing by",
          "You can\u2019t stay long enough watching the plethora of exotic cars and people. I would recommend the cafe near by for a coffee.",
          "Do you go here to people watch, or photograph the cars? probably both, Ferraris and Lambos everywhere, boutiques and very top end designer shops. But it's Monte Carlo. The casino is open at 2.00. To visit make sure you have your passport with you, and no children. Photos can't",
          "Every visit to Monaco should start in the square. Most things are walking distance from here such as the shops, train station, harbour, Fairmount Hotel etc Lovely buzz to the place and lots of expensive cars parked in the square. Great for taking photos or people watching.",
          "We visited this square on 31 December 2019 and just standing in pedestrian outside the casino looking at all kinds of supercars with the old, new and latest edition. It was such a glamorous showcase during New Year's Eve day. Highly recommend event for those who has hobby with",
          "The famous terrace caf\u00e9 de Paris where you can spend the whole afternoon in the sun (in good weather of course) watching stylish people and beautiful cars circling around, having a hot cup of coffee or an icy apero.",
          "Worth 5 miinutes but not a trip. Next to another construction site and stratospheric prices in the ONLY cafe/bar, if you want to be outside.",
          "Located immediately in front of the casino we got off our bus at the top and walked by the attractive well kept gardens down to the casino. There are small but busy roads around it too but worth a visit.",
          "This is a beautiful place to walk around and explore. There is some new modern architecture put up here for stores that were moved out when they knock down the building and build a bigger one. However, it\u2019s very worth going.",
          "this is located in front of the Main casino, and has plenty of restaurants around to enjoy food and drinks.",
          "Expensive cars and fancy people walking around dressed impeccably! Great photo opts and great place to people watch. Highly recommend!",
          "One of Monaco's must-go destinations. Everything is exorbitant, but you needn't spend a penny. Think of it as high-end browsing. You can see incredible super cars, the casino lobby, the fountains, and various stores selling wares for the super rich. From here, you can walk a",
          "Yes, I brought my family here and we just stood there in the square doing people watching. I am not used to this but my teenage children egged me to that. This is a perfect place because of the many amazing cars with beautiful people just parading there in that square. It was",
          "Monte Carlo is a wonderful place to wander through the streets, 'window' shop and envy the incredible cars. The Casino has a doorman, but apparently people of any age can enter the foyer. I was mistakenly lead to believe that minors (under 18) were not allowed even inside the",
          "This leads to the hotels, shopping, casino, cars. Shopping starts right here and leds you up a walkway that has shops all around. Did i mention the cars!",
          "This is literally what it says it is, a square where you will find the famous Casino, Hotel de Paris, Cafe de Paris and other restaurants. There is a beautiful Fountain in the middle but this is not just a square! This is where you can people watch and see the millionaires",
          "Casino Square is the pulse point of Monte Carlo. You can experience the beauty of the fountain, admire the vast numbers of ultra sleek cars, people watch from the Cafe de Paris, and shop at many designer shops in a park-like setting; all within walking distances of each other.",
          "It\u2019s hard to imagine someone coming to Monte-Carlo and not visiting Casino Square. The iconic nature of the Casino, fountains, ultra expensive cars, Hotel de Paris and people watching from the terrace of Cafe de Paris has made this a magnet for visitors. The Christmas",
          "Casino square in Monaco is at place to see. At night time there is a beautiful light, and you can feel James Bond :-)",
          "This isa busy square and you cannot really get any space or time to enjoy it. The road around it is non stop. Pretentious people everywhere you look and expensive cars. If you do not go here you are missing nothing, trust me.",
          "Fabulous square, was there on the 19/11/2018 their national day, flags around the square. Expensive cars parked everywhere. Nice.",
          "The square and garden have been overtaken by shops. The square and garden had been a pleasure to spend time in on previous visits, but now commerce has taken over totally disappointed just designer shops in the wrong place.",
          "If you in Monaco You cannot miss this nice square. It is always full of tourists and expensive cars.",
          "Have a coffee or a drink outside the Cafe de Paris, beside the Casino, and watch the world go by. Very enjoyable",
          "And fancy cars. Loads of tourists around, nice to see but not a must see, unless you're going to the casinos.",
          "Totally worth coming here and spend some time around and go inside. Figuratively even the atmosphere is here expensive but once you are in Monaco it is a must see place even if you are not a great gambler. We spent here a good hour on a November afternoon and enjoyed it a lot.",
          "This is high people and car watching area. There are casinos ( hence the name, a great hotel, cafes for people watching. A prime location for the Monte Carlo gran pr\u00f3x race and it's the location of the famed Cafe de Paris. A must place to visit",
          "Pretty enough for a small place. A little thrilling to feel the buzz as sports cars of all varieties zoom on past. Prices are, as expected expensive but hey you visit Monte Carlo how many times? (probably once and no ned to again... so go for it).",
          "I was wondering that how a place could be beautiful and lovely , I know it is expensive specially for me because of my country but it worth and try to enjoy",
          "Been her a quite a few occasions,it\u2019s the place to be seen not only that the views are fantastic. As you will see all types of people walking and not to mention the card that are parked outside the casino. The drinks are expensive as is the food that said you are not under",
          "There is considerable construction in the area that detracts from any beauty. Add in a bit of rain and it can be a bit depressing.",
          "It\u00b4s a nice place to stop by, a lot of expensive cars and beautiful enviroment. If you pass it\u00b4s ok if not, don\u00b4t worry.",
          "It\u2019s nice..nothing so special except for the luxurious cars and some cafes..just a quick visit is enough",
          "There\u2019s a lot of construction right now and the crowds are heavy. Most will people watch from Cafe de Paris.",
          "The buildings area amazing. Lots of expensive cars and shops. The place is clean and it feel safe safe. Just glad we went in October as there weren\u2019t too many people around.",
          "Beautiful square to see the Rich and Richer. Entrance to Le Casino which requires a 18 \u20ac fee to see the inside of the Casino but you can enter the lobby area and buy items or have a drink at the bar.",
          "You can\u2019t really miss Casino Square as that is where the iconic pictures and films are of Monte Carlo. The building around it are beautiful and the wealth is very apparent. Very expensive cars which I am sure are just driven round so people can be seen and show off as the place",
          "Good space. With the reflection sculpture in the central island, it gave a modern feel public space. The Les Pavilions Monte Carlo is a modern feel to the square",
          "Lovely place to walk around. it's immaculately kept and alot to do around the square (if you can afford it...!!)",
          "We felt it was a waste of time coming here, thankfully wasn't far from Nice and this was just a day trip.",
          "Absolutely adorable to have a walk and watch all the fancy cars and street life 2.0 in this part of Monaco. Lovely fountain and nice restaurants.",
          "Between the white blobs of the Pavilion shops and the grand and elegant Casino, there lies an absolutely delightful patch of park-like nature. In an area the size of Central Park (299 acres), Monaco does itself a great service by incorporating bits of nature among all its",
          "We knew we would not be able to afford to go in the Casino but had promised ourselves a cocktail in the Cafe De Paris and we people watched in the square. This is one amazing place and such a buzzing place, you will not be dissapointed.",
          "nice place to sit on the Cafe de Paris terrace bar watch the world and fabulous cars go by pricey but you are in Monaco",
          "We stopped off at Monaco/Monte Carlo using the train from Nice (takes about 20 minutes on the local TER trains and an adult single ticket cost \u20ac4.10). We just had a quick look around Monaco walking from the station 5 minutes up the road along the marina where you see the",
          "A plush square in front of the casino bustling with activity and people. Keep your eyes open while walking in this area. We bumped into magic Johnson walking down the street.",
          "Beautiful square in front of the casino with many lovely restaurants and terraces. Numerous super expensive cars parked all around the square in front of the casino and 5 star hotels. Lots of people taking pictures of the sports cars and Bentleys.",
          "The Sq is still a place to be seen and the Cafe De Paris is still the People Watching centre of Monte Carlo and still expensive by our standards but you have to sit there alongside the numerous millionaire yacht owners and their young lady friends. It\u2019s all a lot of fun. It\u2019s",
          "The heart of Monaco. Think James Bond and feel a little romanticism. Admire the architecture. Don't even think of gambling. Stare in the windows of stupidly expensive jewelers and walk on by. Tick tourist box!",

          "What a let down this place was. In fact the whole of Monaco itself. Ugly buildings with the odd nice one, full of massive tour groups off cruise liners, construction everywhere and little greenery...don\u2019t bother!",
          "We spent the evening at Cafe de Pari. Parking at the casino ample and cheap (the municipal of course). You need a reservation to dine but you can enjoy the evening outdoors for a coffee, drink or ice cream $$$. Relax and enjoy a romantic evening like the rich and famous in a",

          "We were here just before the Grand Prix and there\u2019s renovations and such going on. I imagine that\u2019s why this place is over crowded. Other than snapping a few pictures of the buildings it\u2019s just a square.",

          "In short, there are more exotic supercars here in the evening than I've ever seen anywhere else. A Maserati is like a Honda and a Porsche is like a Nissan. Ferrari is standard and I literally saw 3-4 Rolls Royce pull up within 5 minutes of each other.",
          "We weren\u2019t originally overly excited to go to Monaco and the only real draw point was the Casino. However once we came out (slightly disappointed) and looked round we realised the better attraction was the Square. It\u2019s rammed with super cars, the occasional chance to see a",

          "As you enter the square you can just imagine seeing James Bond exit the casino with a fashionista on his arm. This square has plenty to see in almost all directions but as there's extensive work ongoing on the perimeter you can't currently see as you'd like. The casino will most",
          "I know- James Bond or Cary Grant or Grace Kelly, pulling up in front in a classic car. The reality is more ordinary, the attractive French style hotel and casino buildings, and a traffic circle. Go, take a look, but not before or after the F1 race when the city is full of",
          "Very high end area of Monaco. Would definitely visit here if you\u2019re into casinos. Pricey for everything but worth the visit",

          "There's a lot of (money) energy flowing through Monte-Carlo and this is one of the best places to watch it all. There's the casinos for gambling, shops for spending what money you brought, and a few nice restaurants to enjoy a bite or a refreshing drink while watching Square. I",
          "The heart of Monte Carlo, the square ooozes with supercars throughout the day, many day trippers and cruise ship parties hang out or pass through during the day , so gets a bit busy however early evening s after 8 is best in my opinion . A must do for any visitor to Monaco.",
          "There\u2019s not much else to say really! The excitement and adrenaline of going into the famous Monte Carlo Casino and seeing it in the sunset just added to the beauty of it! There\u2019s not much to see or do other than this, there\u2019s no real garden or greenery but it\u2019s a pretty sight",

          "Such a special place in the world. As so many people have said there is no where quite like it. Even the refurbishment of the De Paris does not detract from that magic feeling that you absorb",
          "This is just outside the casino, and is well maintained. It has an Anish Kapoor exhibit in the centre of the garden. The rest of the square is laid down to grass and plants, and gives an attractive frontage for the casino.",
          "The best place in the world to people watch .... whilst having a coffee and pastries at the most extortionate cost .... but worth every euro",
          "Worth a look but very busy place. People everywhere! Restaurants, shops and the old Casino. Always overcrowded! My advice is check it out then get out of there!",

          "Right in the middle of the lower part of Monaco, the square is enclosed by the famous Casino and expensive hotels, shops, restaurant and caf\u00e9s. And some parking lots for Rolls Royes, Lamboghinis etc. One of the nicest things is that you can enter the front part of the Casino",

          "Our hotel and the Casino where steps apart on the smallish square and it was just the best experience. The square is more touristy than anything else - if you are Monaco you have to come here. Monaco itself reeks of money and it is the one place in Europe where we know we could",

          "Cars which cost the earth line up on this square as us mere riff raff clamour for pictures and selfies. No old school glamour here just brazen modern day displays of wealth and status. Monte Carlo is a strange, unsettling place and I suppose this location is its historic beating",

          "Well, it among the most famous places in the world. If you are the kind of people that takes selfies, it`s your Mecca. If you`re the the kind of person that asks her a-bit-uglier friend to take their picture while they stay on some stairs while looking at your feet as if you",

          "This was a nice square, but people are spotting here celebrities and rich people, which makes this little uncomfortable place. If you are interested in prestige cars, you can find them here as well.",
          "One of the free things you can do in Monaco is people watch, and by the Casino is one of the best places to do it!! We sat for an evening literally just watching people go by! This may sound like a boring way to spend time, but I enjoyed it!! Groups, couples, parties,",
          "This is the time square of Monaco this is where the best hotels cars and restaurants and shops are it's half a day attraction but it's worth it , there is parking down the road about 100 meters away and it's not expensive at all",
          "Fab place to visit go into the casino itself wonderful building, lush cars outside entrance to the slot machine area is free, but \u20ac17 to into the main area where the tables are situated, and no bet with your \u20ac17 either, but you are in Monte Carlo I suppose, a walk to harbour",
          "This square nearby by to the famous Casino is a must see and must visit. It reflects what Monaco stand for , Elegance and simplicity with a twist of excessive wealth of the very few. People are walking sitting eating their quick lunch or just enjoying the place with greenary",
          "Quite simply: Stunning people Stunning weather Stunning architecture Stunning cars Stunning views Gosh, where do I stop!",

          "The heart of luxury in Monaco. Well worth the price of a coffee to sit and watch the comings and goings of the rich and famous and there top of the range sports cars and limousines. The gardens and beautifully manicured, all of the buildings are pristine. As for the Casino it",

          "It's a bit like Times Square - in the sense that it wont be for everybody - but you have to visit if you are in town. It's busy, full of flash cars, pretty much what you would expect an area like this to be like. Worth a quick pit stop, and a few photos.",

          "We went as a family with two sons (22 and 20) but TripAdvisor does not provide an option for family other than with children under 19. Odd. Anyway, eldest son is an absolute petrol head and what better place to be than the Casino Square. Every few minutes another super car",
          "Was nice to see as we were in the area. We were hoping to visit the casino but there is a dress code for men after 7pm and we missed that by 10 min so we didn't even try to go in. Was glad to be able to see the area anyway.",
          "Worth stopping over for lunch and pictures. There are also loads of souvenir shops here. I didn't buy anything here though, I waited till we got to Nice to buy souvenirs. Thank God I did cause I paid 50% less than my friends that bought in Monaco.",

          "A great place to also see the latest most expensive cars in the world. Do NOT eat there of near there unless you want to spend a fortune. It's sad to see people fawn over the rich and famous for nothing more than their money.",

          "A wonderful place to visit, make sure you go to the cafe de Paris, so you can people watch and also car watch, plenty going on, although expensive, well worth a visit. You can go in the casino but I think they charge just to go in.",

          "A very glamorous area of Monte Carlo. Lively and vibrant. You can people watch in one of the cafes. Beautiful buildings and great designer shopping close by. Close to the Grand Prix course and you can goggle at the high performance cars that cruise by.",

          "Casino square is not to be missed, on one side the splendid Casino with the Hotel de Paris on one side and the Cafe de Paris on the other, it provides the opportunity to observe the life style of the rich and famous. A very popular tourist destination where you can try your luck",
          "This is a great place to both people watch and see the beautiful luxury cars that are parked and going by. Although outnumbered, there are even a few Smart Cars and Jeeps mixed in with the Ferrari's, Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Rolls'. There are some very nice, but expensive,",

          "A clean and pristine area that offers the casino (with many very high-priced cars), expensive retail clothing and jewelry shops, restaurants, coffee/dessert shops. We didn't venture into the casino, but the looks from the outside were very appealing.",
          "We visited Monte-Carlo during a shore excursion provided by the Royal Caribbean, This was a nice building and there were so many high-end level cards in front of the Casino, there is a dress cord, smart casual is not allowed here.",

          "Ok...guess every country in Europe has a changing of the guard. This is just not worth going to. And...to me...that's the best part of Monaco. Downhill after that. Casino Square???? Size of Rockefeller Square ice rink...with guys in black suits standing around... guarding the",
          "Casino Square sure lives up to the hype and fame of Monte Carlo. It feels almost like a scene out of Fast and the Furious with the big gun cars pulling up for all the gawkers to fawn over. We were in town during the poker tournament and prep for the Grand Prix so it had a",
          "I noticed that there is less and less the very most expensive cars. They still are, no doubt, but not so many as it was few years ago. If you are lucky, you'll see really interesting car to come on square or just look people and their enthusiasm to catch a good photo.",
          "Must see if you are in Monaco, but entire Monaco has problems in having a soul. To many people who are to cheap to pay taxes.",
          "The famous casino square in Monte Carlo is the best place to watch the world go by. The super cars, the hotel, the people it's a great place to just relax, it's also in the centre so your close to luxury shops, cafe Paris of course and the casino itself.",
          "Visited Monte-Carlo on a cruise. Can walk off the boat into the town, very easy. We walked the Formula 1 race track as my husband is a fan, and stopped off at various points to explore. We had glorious weather and enjoyed it more than we expected. The square with the casino",

          "The architecture of the casino and the hotel is beautiful but can be seen in other places without all the overpriced boutiques and cars. I know inequality is a fact of life but having lived in Colombia and seen people who live on almost nothing this spectacle becomes disgusting.",

          "We, like many others, took a day trip to Monaco from Nice. We did it all by train and feet to keep the cost down. Casino square was well worth the walk from the palace side of the country(!) to Monte Carlo. Go and see the material pomp - the cars - the high fashion shops - the",
          "We hung out here looking at cars and people watching for a while. Lots of cars to see that you do not normally get to see due to the wealth in the area.",
          "The square is worth a visit. You can usually see very nice cars parked around the edge of driving around! If you are feeling flush you can have a drink at the cafe du Paris but it is not cheap. The square is very busy and lots of people are taking photos of the square.",
          "Great to see the famous Casino Square in real life, a lot smaller than I had anticipated but amazing to just sit and watch it all go by. Especially watching all of the Bentley's, McLaren's, Ferrari's, Lambo's doing the circuit of the square.",

          "We went to Monte Carlo and Monaco for a day and it was well worth the visit. You can certainly see the money that is around and we were treated to a spectacle of fabulous cars outside the casino in the square. It is a gorgeous place and well worth the visit for the day. We",

          "What are they doing to this place? It used to be a large pleasant green park with lovely buildings around it. Now it is all messed up. I realize that is not finished yet but why did they need to change it. My opinion: \" if it's not broken don't try to fix it\". I wish they had",

          "Don't get me wrong, this looks like a nice Casino area... but it does not live up to the hype at all. It's really not that flashy, is super quiet, and if you look beyond the casino its like any other regular place. Nothing special.",

        "wiki": "The Monte Carlo Casino, officially named Casino de Monte-Carlo, is a gambling and entertainment complex located in Monaco. It includes a casino, the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, and the office of Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo.The Casino de Monte-Carlo is owned and operated by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, a public company in which the Monaco government and the ruling royal family have a majority interest. The company also owns the principal hotels, sports clubs, foodservice establishments, and nightclubs throughout the Principality.\nThe citizens of Monaco are forbidden to enter the gaming rooms of the casino.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of opening a gambling casino in Monaco belongs to Princess Caroline, a shrewd, business-minded spouse of Prince Florestan I. Revenues from the proposed venture were supposed to save the House of Grimaldi from bankruptcy. The ruling family's persistent financial problems became especially acute after the loss of tax revenue from two breakaway towns, Menton and Roquebrune, which declared independence from Monaco in 1848 and refused to pay taxes on olive oil and fruit imposed by the Grimaldis.\nIn 1854, Charles, Florestan's son and future Prince of Monaco, recruited a team of Frenchmen\u2014writer Albert Aubert and businessman Napoleon Langlois\u2014to devise a development plan and write a prospectus to attract 4 million francs needed to build a spa for the treatment of various diseases, a gambling casino modeled from the Bad Homburg casino, and English-styled villas. Granted the concession of 30 years to operate a bathing establishment and gaming tables, Aubert and Langlois opened the first casino at 14 December 1856 in Villa Bellevu. Intended to be only a temporary location, the building was a modest mansion in La Condamine.\nIn the late 1850s, Monaco was an unlikely place for a resort to succeed. The lack of roads needed to connect Monaco to Nice and the rest of Europe, and the absence of comfortable accommodations for visitors, as well as the concessionaires' failure to publicize the new resort, resulted in far fewer customers than was originally anticipated. Unable to raise the capital needed to operate the money-losing enterprise, Aubert and Langlois ceded their rights to Frossard de Lilbonne, who in turn passed it to Pierre Auguste Daval in 1857.\n\nDuring this initial period, the casino had been moved several times, until it finally ended up in the area called Les Spelugues (English: The Caves). Construction at this site began on 13 May 1858 to designs of the Parisian architect Gobineau de la Bretonnerie and was completed in 1863. Gobineau de la Bretonnerie also designed the neighboring H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo (constructed in 1862).Although the casino began to make a profit in 1859, Daval was not up to the task. Just like his predecessors, he was incompetent and lacked the ability to bring the gambling enterprise to the scale envisioned by Princess Caroline. Frustrated, she dispatched her private secretary M. Eyneaud to Germany, hoping to recruit Fran\u00e7ois Blanc, a French entrepreneur and operator of the Bad Homburg casino. Blanc declined the offer. It took a lot of time and persuasion on the part of Princess Caroline to convince the Blancs to move to Monaco. Princess Caroline even appealed to Madame Blanc, whom she befriended during her first visit to Bad Homburg, with a suggestion that Monaco's mild climate would be good for Madame Blanc's ill health.\n\nFinally, in 1863 Fran\u00e7ois Blanc agreed to take over Monaco's casino business. To manage the new venture, a company\u2014the Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers\u2014was formed with capital of 15 million francs. Among the prominent investors were Charles-Bonaventure-Fran\u00e7ois Theuret, Bishop of Monaco, and Cardinal Pecci, the future Pope Leo XIII. Blanc became the single majority stockholder in the company and received a 50-year concession, which would last until 1913. Blanc used his connections to quickly raise the required capital, and began the massive construction. On Blanc's insistence, the Spelugues area where the gambling complex was located was renamed to make it sound more attractive to casino visitors. A few suggestions were considered, and the name Monte Carlo was chosen in Prince Charles' honor.\nIn 1878\u201379, the casino building was transformed and expanded to designs of Jules Dutrou (1819\u20131885) and Charles Garnier, the architect who had designed the Paris opera house now known as the Palais Garnier. Fran\u00e7ois Blanc knew Garnier because Blanc had provided a loan of at least 4.9 million gold francs to the cash-strapped government of the French Third Republic, so that the opera house, which had been started in 1861, could be completed. It had finally opened in 1875. The alterations to the Casino de Monte Carlo included the addition of a concert hall (designed by Garnier and later named the Salle Garnier), located on the side of the casino facing the sea, and the redesign and expansion of the gaming rooms and public spaces, mostly carried out by Dutrou on the side of the casino facing the Place du Casino, where the H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo and the  were also located.\n\nIn 1880\u201381, the casino was expanded again, to the east of Dutrou's Moorish Room, by the addition of the Trente-et-Quarante Gaming Room, also designed by Garnier. Subsequent additions and expansions, and the remodeling of the Trente-et-Quarante Gaming Room into the Salle des Am\u00e9ricains, have mostly obliterated Garnier's contributions to this part of the casino, except for some ceiling decorations.  In 1898\u201399, the Salle Garnier was remodeled by architect Henri Schmit, primarily in the stage area, so that it would be more suitable for opera and ballet performances. However, much of Garnier's original facade and the interior design of the auditorium itself remain intact. Despite all of the later additions and modifications, the casino still has a distinctly Beaux Arts style.\nThe most famous example of the gambler's fallacy occurred in a game of roulette at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in the summer of 1913, when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremely uncommon occurrence, although no more nor less common than any of the other 67,108,863 sequences of 26 red or black. Gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an \"imbalance\" in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by a long streak of red. In 1921, the first Women\u2019s Olympiad was held at the casino gardens. \nUntil recently, the Casino de Monte-Carlo has been the primary source of income for the House of Grimaldi and the Monaco economy.\n\n\n== Casino facilities ==\nThe casino has facilities to play a variety of games which include:\n\n\n=== Breaking the bank ===\nIn 1873, Joseph Jagger gained the casino great publicity by \"breaking the bank at Monte Carlo\" by discovering and capitalizing on a bias in one of the casino's roulette wheels. Technically, the bank in this sense was the money kept on the table by the croupier. According to an article in The Times in the late 19th century, it was thus possible to \"break the bank\" several times. The 1892 song \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\", made famous by Charles Coborn, was probably inspired by the exploits of Charles Wells, who \"broke the bank\" on many occasions on the first two of his three trips.\nAccording to the book Busting Vegas by Ben Mezrich, a team of blackjack players recruited from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by team-leader Victor Cassius and Semyon Dukach attempted to break the bank at Monte Carlo with the assistance of a team-play-based system. The book describes how the management of Monte Carlo responded to the success of the team. According to Semyon the account in Busting Vegas is accurate aside from the fact that the team was made up of himself, Andy Bloch and another player he refers to as \"Katie\".\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nJames Bond, a fictional British spy, is often associated with the Casino de Monte-Carlo.\nThe architecture of glamorous Belle \u00c9poque building of the Casino de Monte-Carlo was used by Ian Fleming to describe a casino in \"Royale-Les-Eaux\", a fictional resort featured in Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale (1953).\nMonaco and its casino were the locations for a number of James Bond movies, including Never Say Never Again and GoldenEye, as well as for the \"Casino Royale\" episode of the CBS's Climax! television show.\nThe casino served as a filming location for the 2004 film Ocean's Twelve.\nThe casino makes an appearance in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.\n\n\n== Other mentions ==\nThe Monte Carlo method, a computational approach which relies on repeated random sampling to solve difficult numerical problems, was named after the Casino de Monte-Carlo by physicist Nicholas Metropolis.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCasino Gardens and Terraces\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nBonillo, Jean-Lucien, et al.

        "wiki": "Princess Antoinette of Monaco, Baroness of Massy (Antoinette Louise Alberte Suzanne Grimaldi; 28 December 1920 \u2013 18 March 2011), was a member of the princely family of Monaco and the elder sister of Prince Rainier III and aunt of Albert II, Prince of Monaco. Her parents were Count Pierre de Polignac and Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois.\nShe was born in Paris of French and Monegasque ancestry.\n\n\n== Children ==\nPrincess Antoinette had a long-term liaison with Alexandre-Athenase Nogh\u00e8s, a Monegasque-born attorney and international tennis champion, in the mid-1940s. The couple had three children born out-of-wedlock who were legitimated by their parents' eventual marriage and, henceforth, included in the line of succession to the Monegasque Throne until the death of Antoinette's brother, Prince Rainier III, in 2005; Elizabeth Ann de Massy (1947-2020), Christian Louis de Massy (born 1949), and Christine Alix de Massy (1951-1989).\n\n\n== Marriages ==\nPrincess Antoinette and Alexandre-Athenase Nogh\u00e8s subsequently married at the Monaco consulate in Genoa on 4 December 1951 (her first, his second) and divorced in 1954.On 15 November 1951, Antoinette was created Baroness of Massy (Baronne de Massy). Her children (Elizabeth-Ann, Christian-Louis and Christine-Alix) were named Grimaldi at birth. They subsequently had their names changed to de Massy. He claim the title of Baron through their mother, but he is not entitled to it.\nShe married her second husband, Dr. Jean-Charles Rey (Monaco, 22 October 1914 \u2013 Monaco, 17 September 1994), president of the Conseil National, the Parlement de Monaco in The Hague on 2 December 1961 and they divorced in 1974.\nHer third and last husband was John Brian Gilpin (Southsea, Hampshire, 10 February 1930 \u2013 London, 5 September 1983), a British ballet dancer, whom she married in Monaco on 28 July 1983. He died suddenly six weeks later.\n\n\n== Life account ==\nHaving divorced Nogh\u00e8s, she and her lover Jean-Charles Rey hatched a plan to depose her brother Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and declare herself regent on the basis of having a son who would one day inherit the throne. This led to the breakup of the relationship.Rainier's marriage to Grace Kelly in 1956 and the arrival of his heirs, Princess Caroline in 1957 and Prince Albert in 1958, effectively scuttled Antoinette's plans. She was removed from the Palace by her sister-in-law, Princess Grace, and thereafter was estranged from the princely family for many years.She was known to be somewhat eccentric and was described as \"completely mad\" by her servants. Having been banished from Monaco in the late 1950s, she lived down the coast from Monaco at \u00c8ze, with a large collection of dogs and cats. She was the president of Monaco's Society for the Protection of Animals and Refuge and a patron of the UK-based Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.Upon the accession of Albert II in 2005, Antoinette and her descendants lost their place in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, which is limited to the current sovereign's descendants, siblings, and siblings' descendants.The Princess Antoinette Park in Monaco's La Condamine district was named in her honour.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 18 March 2011 Princess Antoinette died at The Princess Grace Hospital Centre, aged 90. Her funeral took place on 24 March 2011. She is buried in the Chapel of Peace in Monaco beside her parents, her daughters Elizabeth-Ann and Christine-Alix, her last husband John Brian Gilpin and her nephew, Stefano Casiraghi.\n\n\n== Patronages ==\nPresident of the Society for the Protection of Animals and Refuge of Monaco.\nPresident of the Canine Society of Monaco.\nPresident of the \u201cMonaco Interviews on Energy Medicines\u201d, which became, the \u201cMonaco International Interviews\u201d.\nPresident of the Monegasque Tennis Federation.\nPresident of the Monte Carlo Country Club.\n\n\n== Titles and honours ==\nTitles28 December 1920 \u2013 15 November 1951: Her Serene Highness Princess Antoinette of Monaco\n15 November 1951 \u2013 18 March 2011: Her Serene Highness Princess Antoinette of Monaco, Baroness of MassyHonours Monaco: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint-Charles\n Monaco: Medal for Physical Education and Sports, First Class\n Monaco: Medal of Recognition of the Monegasque Red Cross\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPalace: My Life in the Royal Family of Monaco by Baron Christian de Massy & Charles Higham (1986, Atheneum, ISBN 0-689-11636-5)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the official residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and besieged by many foreign powers. Since the end of the 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family who first captured it in 1297. The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with their larger and stronger neighbours.\nThus while other European sovereigns were building luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics and common sense demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco one of the most unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.\nThe Grimaldis' occupation of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, the absence of alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted in their use of the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected in the evolution of the palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became symbols of the slightly risqu\u00e9 glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became a chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.\n\n\n== Princely Palace ==\n\nThe palace is a blend of architectural styles; its ancient origins are indicated by a lack of symmetry. Thus to evaluate the architecture, wings and blocks have to be observed separately. The principal fa\u00e7ade appears as a terrace of Renaissance style palazzi from differing periods of the Renaissance era (Illustrations 1 and 12) which\u2014even though they form only one palace\u2014is exactly what they are. These wings are however united by their common rusticated ground floor. This Renaissance architecture seems to mask earlier fortifications, the towers of which rise behind the differing classical fa\u00e7ades. These towers\u2014many complete with crenellations and machicolations\u2014were actually mostly rebuilt during the 19th century. At the rear of the palace the original medieval fortifications seem untouched by time. (Illustration 4). A greater architectural harmony has been achieved within the court of honour around which the palace is built, where two tiers of frescoed open arcades serve as both a ceremonial balcony for the prince's appearances and a state entrance and corridor linking the formal state rooms of the palace.\n\nThe most notable of the many rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were enhanced in the style of those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.Other rooms in the state suite include the Red Room \u2014 so called because its walls are covered in red brocade \u2014 a large drawing room containing paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.\nThe most remarkable room in the suite is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room is lined with Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.\nWhile the overriding atmosphere of the interior and exterior of the palace is of the 18th century, the palace itself is not. Much of its appearance is a result of a long evolution dating from the 12th century, overshadowed by heavy restoration and refurnishing during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\n== Grimaldi fortress ==\n\nMonaco's history predates the Roman occupation of AD 122. Its large natural harbour ensured a steady stream of visitors from Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon. Later the Phoenicians came to trade silk, oil, and spices with the natives. It was the Phoenicians who introduced to this area of the Mediterranean their god Melkart, later known by the Romans as Hercules Monoikos. It was after this god that the Romans renamed the area Portus Hercules Moneici, which has evolved to the present name of Monaco.\nThe seat of the Prince of Monaco was established on the Rocher de Monaco (Illustration 5) as a fortress in 1191 when the harbour, that is today lined by Monte Carlo, was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. The harbour and its immediate area were given to the Genoese by the Emperor Henry IV with the proviso that the Genoese protect the coastline from piracy. Further territory was ceded to the new owners by the Council of Peille and the Abbaye de Saint Pons. In 1215 work began on a new fortress, comprising four towers connected by ramparts protected by a curtain wall. This forms the core of the present palace.\nGenoa was important in the politics of 12th-century Europe. The Genoese were a nation of merchants, and such was their wealth that they frequently fulfilled a role as bankers to the other nation states. However, the Genoese became divided following the rift caused when the Emperor Frederick II challenged the power of Pope Innocent IV. Two distinct camps formed: the Guelphs who supported the pope and the Ghibellines who were loyal to the imperial crown. Siding with the Guelphs were one of the patrician families of Genoa\u2014the Grimaldi. Throughout the 13th century these two groups fought. Finally at the end of the century the Ghibellines were victorious and banished their opponents, including the Grimaldi, from Genoa. The Grimaldi settled in the area today known as the French Riviera. Several castles in the area are still known as Chateau Grimaldi, and testify to the strong presence of various branches of the family in the vicinity.\n\nLegend relates that in January 1297 Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi, disguised as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. This event is commemorated by a statue of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (Illustration 6) and in the arms of the House of Grimaldi where Fran\u00e7ois is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (Illustration 2).\nCharles I, who ruled from 1331 to 1357, and was the son of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, significantly enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently, they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.\nFor the next hundred years the Grimaldi defended their territory from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence. The fortress was frequently bombarded, damaged, and restored. Gradually the Grimaldi began to make an alliance with France which strengthened their position. Now more secure, the Grimaldi lords of Monaco now began to recognise the need not only to defend their territory, but also to have a home reflecting their power and prestige.\nThroughout the 15th century, both the fortress and the Rocher continued to be extended and further defended until it became a garrison accommodating some 400 troops. The slow transformation from fortified house to palace (Illustration 7) began during this era, first with building by Lamberto Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco (who between 1458 and 1494 was \"a noteworthy ruler who handled diplomacy and the sword with equal talent\"), and then by his son Jean II. This period saw the extension of the east side of the fortress with a three\u2013floored wing, guarded by high scalloped walls connecting the bastion towers\u2014St Mary (M in Illustration 7), Middle (K) and South (H). This large new wing contained the palace's principal room, the State Hall (today known as the Guard Room). Here the princes carried out their official business and held court. Further, more luxurious, rooms complete with balconies and loggias were designed for the private use of the Grimaldi family. In 1505 Jean II was killed by his brother Lucien.\n\n\n== Fortress to palace ==\n\n\n=== Lucien I (1505\u20131523) ===\n\nJean II was succeeded by his brother Lucien I. Peace did not reign in Monaco for long; in December 1506 14,000 Genoese troops besieged Monaco and its castle, and for five months 1,500 Mon\u00e9gasques and mercenaries defended the Rocher before achieving victory in March 1507. This left Lucien I to walk a diplomatic tightrope between France and Spain in order to preserve the fragile independence of the tiny state which was in truth subject to Spain. Lucien immediately set about repairing the ravages of war to the fortified palace which had been damaged by heavy bombardment. To the main wing (see Illustrations 3 & 7 \u2013 H to M ), built by Prince Lambert and extended during the reign of Jean II, he now added a large wing (H to C) which today houses the state apartments.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 I (1523\u20131581) ===\nDuring the reign of Honor\u00e9 I the internal transformation from fortress to palace was continued. The Treaty of Trodesillas at the beginning of Honor\u00e9's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This provided the security to allow the Lord of Monaco to concentrate on the more comfortable side of his residence rather than the constant need to defend it.\nThe courtyard was rebuilt, the architect Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading on the upper level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honor\u00e9 II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On the other side of the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.Further enlargements were carried out in order to entertain the Emperor Charles V in 1529, when he stayed four nights at the palace during his journey in state to Bologna for his coronation by Pope Clement VII.\n\nArchitecturally this was an exciting period, but Honor\u00e9 I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honor\u00e9's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded the end of the rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 II (1597\u20131662) ===\n\nMonaco's vulnerability was further brought home in 1605 when the Spanish installed a garrison there. In 1633 Honor\u00e9 II (Illustration 8), was officially addressed as \"Serene Prince\" by the Spanish king, thus recognizing Monaco as a principality for the first time. However, as Spanish troops were currently in occupation, this recognition was seen as little more than a gesture to keep Honor\u00e9 happy.Honor\u00e9 II was a francophile. Following his education in Milan, he had been cultivated by the intellectual salons of Paris. Thus, having close affinities with France both culturally and politically, he rebelled against the Spanish presence in Monaco. While he realised that Monaco needed the protection of another power, France was Honor\u00e9 II's favoured choice. In 1641, heavily supported by the French, he attacked the Spanish garrison and expelled the Spanish, declaring \"the glorious liberty of Monaco\". The liberty mentioned was entirely dependent on France, as Monaco now entered a period as a protectorate of France which would last until 1814. As a result of this action Honor\u00e9 II is today regarded as the hero of Monaco.Highly educated and a patron of the arts, Honor\u00e9 II, secure on his throne, began collecting works by Titian, D\u00fcrer, Raphael, Rubens and Michelangelo which formed the basis of the art collection that furnished the palace slowly evolving from the Monaco fortress. Over the following 30-year period he transformed it into a palace suitable for a prince (Illustration 9).\nHe commissioned the architect Jacques Catone not only to enlarge the palace, but also to soften its grim fortified appearance. The main fa\u00e7ade facing the square, the \"front\" of the palace, was given decorative embellishments. The upper loggias (B) to the right of the entrance were glazed. Inside the palace the State Rooms Wing was restyled and the enfilade of state apartments created. A new chapel adorned by a cupola (built on the site marked D) was dedicated to St John the Baptist. This new work helped conceal the forbidding Serravalle Bastion from the courtyard, to create the lighter atmosphere of a Renaissance palazzo.\n\n\n== Absentee landlords and revolution (1662\u20131815) ==\n\nDuring the late 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an independent state, it was in reality a province of France. Its rulers spent much of their time at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure of Versailles was greater than that of their own country.\nHonor\u00e9 II was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Louis I. The new prince had an urbane personality and spent much time with his wife at the French court, where he enjoyed the unusual distinction of being both a foreign head of state and a peer of France. Impressed by the palaces of the French king, who had employed the architect Jean du Cerceau to carry out alterations to the palace at Fontainebleau, Louis I used Fontainebleau as the inspiration for enhancements to his palace at Monaco. Thus he was responsible for two of the palace's most notable features: the entrance\u2014a huge Baroque arch surmounted by a broken pediment bearing the Grimaldi Arms (Illustration 10)\u2014and more memorable still, a double horseshoe staircase modelled on that at Fontainebleau. The thirty steps which compose the staircase are said to have been sculpted from a single block of Carrara marble.  Both the architrave of the new entrance and the horseshoe stairs were designed by Antoine Grigho, an architect from Como.A prince noted for the permissiveness of his private life, Louis I's prodigality was notorious. While visiting England in 1677 he incurred the ire of King Charles II by showering expensive gifts on Hortense Mancini, the king's mistress. The English and Prince Louis later became political enemies when Louis took part in the Anglo-Dutch Wars against England, leading his own Monaco Cavalry into battles in Flanders and Franche-Comt\u00e9. These acts earned Louis the gratitude of Louis XIV who made him ambassador to the Holy See, charged with securing the Spanish Succession. However, the cost of upholding his position at the papal court caused him to sell most of his grandfather Honor\u00e9 II's art collection, denuding the palace he had earlier so spectacularly enhanced. Louis died before securing the Spanish throne for France, an act which would have earned the Grimaldi huge rewards. Instead Europe was immediately plunged into turmoil as the War of the Spanish Succession began.\n\nIn 1701, Prince Antoine succeeded Louis I and inherited an almost bankrupt Monaco, though he did further embellish the Royal Room. On its ceiling, Gregorio de Ferrari and Alexandre Haffner depicted a figure of Fame surrounded by lunettes illustrating the four seasons.\nAntoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Mon\u00e9gasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honor\u00e9 III.Honor\u00e9 III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honor\u00e9 III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798.\nThe Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honor\u00e9 III's son and heir, the future Honor\u00e9 IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be governed by others, most notably a former tutor. It was on one of Honor\u00e9 III's rare visits to the palace in 1767 that illness forced Edward, Duke of York, to land at Monaco. The sick duke was allocated the state bedchamber where he promptly died. Since that date the room has been known as the York Room.\nDespite its lack of continuous occupancy, by the final quarter of the 18th century the palace was once again a \"splendid place\" (Illustration 12). However revolution was afoot, and in the late 1780s Honor\u00e9 III had to make concessions to his people who had caught the revolutionary ideas from their French neighbours. This was only the beginning of the Grimaldi's problems. In 1793 the leaders of the French Revolution annexed Monaco. The prince was imprisoned in France and his property and estates, including the palace, were forfeited to France.\nThe palace was looted by the prince's subjects, and what remained of the furnishings and art collection was auctioned by the French government. Further changes were heaped on both the country and palace. Monaco was renamed Fort d'Hercule and became a canton of France while the palace became a military hospital and poorhouse. In Paris, the prince's daughter-in-law Francoise-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul-Stainville (1766\u20131794) was executed, one of the last to be guillotined during the Reign of Terror.  Honor\u00e9 III died in 1795 in Paris, where he had spent most of his life, without regaining his throne.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Regaining the palace ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was succeeded by his son Honor\u00e9 IV (1758\u20131819) whose marriage to Louise d'Aumont Mazarin had done so much to restore the Grimaldi fortunes. Much of this fortune had been depleted by the hardships of the revolution. On 17 June 1814 under the Treaty of Paris, the Principality of Monaco was restored to Honor\u00e9 IV.\nThe fabric of the palace had been completely neglected during the years in which the Grimaldi had been exiled from Monaco. Such was the state of disrepair that part of the east wing had to be demolished along with Honor\u00e9 II's bathing pavilion, which stood on the site occupied today by the palace's former Napoleon Museum, which closed in 2014, and the building housing the palace archives.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV died shortly after his throne was restored to him, and structural restoration of the palace began under Honor\u00e9 V and was continued after his death in 1841 by his brother Prince Florestan. However, by the time of Florestan's accession, Monaco was once again experiencing political tensions caused by financial problems. These resulted from its position as a protectorate of Sardinia, the country to which it had been ceded by France following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Florestan, an eccentric (he had been a professional actor), left the running of Monaco to his wife, Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. Despite her attempts to rule, her husband's people were once again in revolt. In an attempt to ease the volatile situation Florestan ceded power to his son Charles, but this came too late to appease the Mon\u00e9gasques. Menton and Roquebrune broke away from Monaco, leaving the Grimaldi's already small country hugely diminished\u2014little more than Monte Carlo.\n\nFlorestan died in 1856 and his son, Charles, who had already been ruling what remained of Monaco, succeeded him as Charles III (Illustration 15). Menton and Roquebrune officially became part of France in 1861, reducing Monaco's size at a stroke by 80%. With time on his hands, Charles III now devoted his time to completing the restoration of his palace begun by his uncle Honor\u00e9 V. He rebuilt St Mary's Tower (Illustration 14) and completely restored the chapel, adding a new altar, and having its vaulted ceiling painted with frescoes, while outside the fa\u00e7ade was painted by Jacob Fro\u00ebschle and Deschler with murals illustrating various heroic deeds performed by the Grimaldi. The Guard Room, the former great hall of the fortress (now known as the State Hall), was transformed by new Renaissance decorations and the addition of a monumental chimneypiece.\nCharles III also made serious attempts to find the various works of art and furniture looted, sold and dispersed during the revolution. Together with new purchases, a fine art collection once again adorned the palace which included not only family portraits such as that of Lucien I by de Predis; Honor\u00e9 II by Philippe de Champaigne; the head of Antoine I by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and van Loo's portrait of Louise-Hyppolyte (Illustration 11) but also such masterpieces as The Music Lesson by Titian.\nCharles III was also responsible for another palace in Monte Carlo, one which would fund his restorations, and turn around his country's faltering economy. This new palace was Charles Garnier's Second Empire casino, completed in 1878 (Illustration 16). The first Monaco casino had opened the previous decade. Through the casino Monaco became self-supporting.\n\n\n=== Decline of Grimaldi power ===\nBy the time of Charles III's death in 1889, Monaco and Monte Carlo were synonymous as one and the same place, and had acquired, through gambling, a reputation as a louche and decadent playground of the rich. It attracted everyone from Russian grand dukes and railway magnates, often with their mistresses, to adventurers, causing the small country to be derided by many including Queen Victoria. In fact so decadent was Monaco considered that from 1882, when she first began visiting the French Riviera, Queen Victoria refused to make a courtesy social call at the palace. The contemporary writer Sabine Baring-Gould described the habitu\u00e9es of Monaco as \"the moral cesspool of Europe.\"\n\nThe successive rulers of Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, a daughter of Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry into the family she contemplated turning the casino into a convalescent home for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice was able to put her plan into action.\nIn 1910, the palace was stormed during the Monegasque Revolution. The prince pronounced an end to absolute monarchy by promulgating a constitution with an elected parliament the following year.\nAlbert was succeeded in 1922 by his son Louis II. Louis II had been brought up by his mother and stepfather, Prince Taszil\u00f3 Festetics de Tolna, in Germany, and did not know Monaco at all until he was 11. He had a distant relationship with his father and served in the French Army. While posted abroad, he met his mistress Marie Juliette Louvet, by whom he had a daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born in Algeria in 1898. As Prince of Monaco, Louis II spent much time elsewhere, preferring to live on the family estate of Le Marchais close to Paris. In 1911 Prince Louis had a law passed legitimising his daughter so that she could inherit the throne, in order to prevent its passing to a distant German branch of the family. The law was challenged and developed into what became known as Monaco succession crisis. Finally in 1919 the prince formally adopted his illegitimate daughter Charlotte, who became known as Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. Louis II's collection of artefacts belonging to Napoleon I form the foundation of the Napoleon Museum at the palace, which is open to the public.\nDuring World War II, Louis attempted to keep Monaco neutral, although his sympathies were with the Vichy French Government.  This caused a rift with his grandson Rainier, his daughter's son, and the heir to Louis's throne, who strongly supported the Allies against the Nazis.\nFollowing the liberation of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis did little for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946 he was spending most of his time in Paris, and on 27 July of that year, he married for the first time. Absent from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived on their estate in France. Prince Louis died in 1949 and was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Rainier III.\n\n\n== Rainier III ==\n\nPrince Rainier III was responsible for not only turning around the fortune and reputation of Monaco but also for overseeing the restoration of the palace. Upon his accession in 1949 Prince Rainier III immediately began a program of renovation and restoration. Many of the external frescoes on the courtyard were restored, while the southern wing, destroyed following the French revolution, was rebuilt. This is the part of the palace where the ruling family have their private apartments. The wing also houses the Napoleon Museum and the archives.\nThe frescoes decorating the open arcade known as the Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who imported works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of the rooms were refurnished and redecorated. Many of the marble floors have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with intarsia designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.Together with his wife, the late Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier not only restored the palace, but from the 1970s also made it the headquarters of a large and thriving business, which encouraged light industry to Monaco, the aim of which was to lessen Monaco's dependence on the income from gambling. This involved land reclamation, the development of new beaches, and high rise luxury housing. As a result of Monaco's increase in prestige, in 1993 it joined the United Nations, with Rainier's heir Prince Albert as head of the Monaco delegation.Princess Grace predeceased her husband, dying in 1982 as the result of a car accident. When Rainier III died in 2005 he left both his palace and his country in a stronger and more stable state of repair financially and structurally than they had been for centuries.\n\n\n== The palace in the 21st century ==\nToday the palace is home to Prince Rainier's son and successor, Prince Albert II. The state rooms are open to the public during the summer, and since 1960, the palace's courtyard has been the setting for open-air concerts given by Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra (formerly known as the Orchestra of the National Opera).However, the palace is far more than a tourist attraction and museum: it remains a fully working palace and headquarters of the Mon\u00e9gasque ruler, a fact emphasised by the sentries on constant guard duty at the entrance (Illustration 17). The sovereign princes, although bound by constitution, are involved with the day-to-day running of Monaco as both a country and a business. Today Monaco covers an area of 197 hectares (487 acres) of which 40 hectares (99 acres) have been reclaimed from the sea since 1980.For important Mon\u00e9gasque events\u2014such as Grimaldi weddings and births\u2014the palace courtyard is opened and the assembled citizens of Monaco are addressed by the prince from the Gallery of Hercules overlooking the courtyard.  The courtyard is also used to host the annual children's Christmas party. Through such events, the palace continues to play a central role in the lives of the prince and his subjects, as it has done for over 700 years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Monaco\nList of rulers of Monaco\nHistory of Monaco\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Enjoyed the story, especially through the Grace Kelly era, but fantastic history lesson as well. I learned a lot about Monaco. The construction and detailing of the palace is of particular interest to me, particularly the mosaics in the marble floors, and the furniture cabinetry",
          "This is a great tour, in a beautiful location and interesting history. Try to see the changing of the guards.",
          "We reached here in time for the change of guard ceremony at 11.55 am. The palace and its surrounds invariably have you clicking.",
          "I had mixed impressions about Monaco: overbuilt and crowded but is has a really beautiful and well preserved old town and the Place du Palais is lovely.",
          "Markup of the old town, everything happening around the palace. It has only small part of old time, everything else is restored and looks brand new like anything else in Monaco",
          "Nice quick look at the Palace. The changing of the guard was good as well. Audio is easy to use. Staff friendly. Hop on/off right there. Great photo as well.",
          "It is a bit of a climb to get to the top but the views are amazing, very central too so if your only there for a few hours like we were but wanted a good viewpoint then I would recommend. There are quite a few little shops and restaurants (which were very reasonably priced) at",
          "Nice view we can see all cities on both side and lovely walking g around it should few hour in there",
          "We did the combined ticket of the Palace and the Aquarium (best value). The palace is an amazing glimpse into the history of monarchy in Europe. The tour includes an audio tour. The overall tour is only through a small portion of the palace since it is still used as",
          "Whilst in Monaco you need to visit the Palace and square - the views from up there are superb - and you can \"plot\" the whole of the F1 track",
          "This is a absolutely humongous, fantastic, amazing and brilliant palace. When we saw the palace some soldiers came out to entertain us.",
          "A must visit if you go to Monaco. Lovely grounds all around and the view is stunning. i didn't go into the Palace but i was told it was worth seeing (not enough time on my trip)",
          "It was great to see guards changing. Palace location is really great and view from top is beautiful. Worth spending time. Lovely panaromic view.",
          "The architecture of this place is unbelievable. The building designs are amazing and the views all around are incredible! It can be very busy at midday when the guards walk out, but other than that it was great!",
          "Wander up to the rock of Monaco to find this place. Beautiful little palace but really dwarfed by the panoramic views it offers of monte carlo across the bay. We saw the changing on the guard - a bit dissapointing, but head up here for the views. Picturesque.",
          "We managed to tour the palace on the last day of the season, and are very glad we could. It is beautiful, and that is coming from people who have been to their fair share of royal palaces around Europe. There is an audio guide included if you like that sort of thing, but it",
          "We were lucky to be on time for the change of guards it was simply beautiful the area the views can\u2019t get enough",
          "The palace is beautiful, but what catch my attention was the breathtaking views from the sea you\u2019ll see from there. Simply amazing and I got really amazed by the scene... it was a sunny day, so... as anyone knows, the sun and the blue sky are the best filter!",
          "What an impressive place and the narrative about its occupants. Shame photos are precluded anywhere within the palace.",
          "We were able to get to the palace in time for the changing of the guard. Which was pretty neat. Monaco is just so beautiful. Hit the little shops around the palace. There is some nice little restaurants tucked away. Take the walk down to the harbor. Not a difficult walk.",
          "We did not pre-book for anything in Monaco during June and never queued for entry either. Without the the audio tour of the Prince's Palace, I think it may be a bit boring, but the commentary gave enough information to give meaning to what one sees. I was pleasantly surprised at",
          "The changing of the guards was built up to be quite an event. There were probably 200 people there for the event that lasted all of 90 seconds - move to the other side of the square for fantastic views over Port Hercule instead!",
          "What a beautiful place final resting place for grace and the prince on the palace cathedral close to the palace wow. Beautiful gardens overlooking spectacular views to Monaco marina breathtaking views. Monte Carlo what a place went into the casino didn\u2019t think they would let us",
          "We found the walk up to the palace lovely with plenty of spots to take pictures and clean public rest rooms. The changing of the guards is at 11:45. It is something to see. Not spectacular but still interesting and in December the crowds are thin, ability to take nice pictures",
          "For best pictures of Monte Carlo I recommend going there. I walked up from the harbour to the palace which was a hike but it was very much worth it at the end. The views are stunning. I was there when the guards changed (around sunset) . It was interesting to see.",
          "We was here in July when it's hot. There is a stairway to the palace. Have water with you, it's very hot. Details of the palace and surroundings you can see on our Youtube Channel: Dan & Beka journey. ENJOY!",
          "A must, you can't miss it in Monte-Carlo. Don't miss the guard-change too (11.45 about). Not very amazing for a Royal Palace, maybe for its modest look, but go and take a look. The are lots of nice shops to buy presents of your journey. Have fun!",
          "A visit takes journey of history from Guelfes to the Napoleonic period You can admire : The Italian style gallery 16th century depicting mythological scenes. The Luis 15th salon,the marvellous harmony of gold and blue. The Throne room ,where historical festivals and ceremonies",
          "We toured the state apartments one more time and it was a mistake. We had visited them many years ago, but thought we try them again. It was a mistake. Somme of the rooms were under repair and the rest were very dowdy to say the least. It\u2019s a pity that his serene highness",
          "This place offers the best view of Monte Carlo. I would not recommend paying to do the tour unless you really care about the Prince. It is a hike to get up but once you\u2019re there it\u2019s truly worth it. We made it up just in time for sunset and it was breathtaking. There are",
          "The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the official residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. It was built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress. It's has very clean lines, not as lavish as the Casino of Monte Carlo!",
          "I didn't have cash and wanted to buy ticket for the private cars exhibition and the palace, which is \u20ac11.50, minimum charged on card \u20ac12. ATM machine was broken and staff was extremely unhelpful. I was in a hurry and tried to find a solution but instead of help both women was",
          "Interesting and fairly grand. It was built by the Gennoese as a fortress in 1191 and has been the stronghold (first) and then palace of the ruling Grimaldi family since 1297. Tours available.Has been the official",
          "Just saw that this place ranks #16 on the places to visit in Monaco. Well, in my opinion it deserves to be at 1. Its a must visit place on your visit to this region. The Palace square provides a great panoramic view of the whole city and the beautiful sealine. Its a short walk",
          "we visited the palaca and specifically the change of the guard with my wife last month .the change of the guard was something really nice looking all those soldiers smartly dressed .th palace itself did not impresssed me. the thing that impressed me more was the view from the",
          "Monaco is a strange place; a bit like being in the Trueman show. The hike to the top of this hill is disappointing when you get here. Not a great view, just boats and a castle that looks like it is built out of breeze blocks. The whole place feels like it has no soul. Probably",
          "Excellent Views of the Harbor from the Top of the Mountain. An adjacent Old Town provides for shopping and quaint little restaurants on the narrow streets.",
          "You only really see one wing of the palace but the audio guide (part of the entry fee) brings it to life and it is well worth seeing.",
          "It is a beautiful palace with a huge courtyard. You will see a few room: bedrooms, offices, official rooms, library. Every one is in a different style, colour and very unique. No photos/ videos allowed! Entrance is 8\u20ac. It is a truly and unforgettable experience!",
          "As residence for a somewhat old royal family, this Palace has very unimpressive architecture. From plaza, It looks more like a reconstructed military barracks. The exhibits inside were okay, most of the rooms were drably lit. The throne room was an utter disappointment. It\u2019s a",
          "I couldn't get in. Beautiful place.lot of Travelers watching guard changing ceremony. Beautiful scene. Must visit for Moroco Traveling.",
          "We listened to the other tips and planned to get there early for a upfront view of the changing of the guard ceremony. Glad I did. We arrived at about 11:15 and a spot to the left center was ideal for full view of the arrival of the band and both sides of the guards and the",
          "Had a walk up to the palace. Nice view over Monaco and the palace was nice. Small shops and restaurants in the streets nearby. Would recommend to eat here instead of in the harbour.",
          "Very grand palace on a hilltop with a great view ( if he could get some privacy to open a window I guess) Magnificent buildings all in a place around. Looks like some new bits have been added .. guards out the front.",
          "No, I did not try to break that rule. The walls have eyes and, besides, we are all too busy walking from room to room, reading the info signs, taking in the lavishness of the settings, and finding the painting of the royal family in their prime. America's first princess hopped",
          "This administrative area of the Principality of Monaco is only about 30 mins away from Nice (in Southern France) by train. I happened to be in Nice for an engagement and I had one day off, which I decided to spend visiting Monte Carlo. The train ride along the way was very",
          "A self-guided audio tour was very interesting. Glad we went. Didn\u2019t see that it would be easy, or even possible, for those confined to wheel chairs. So check first. Arrived just prior to the single \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d ceremony which occurs at 11:55 am daily. We made the",
          "The reigning prince; Albert, and his family live here. There are four guards that keep watch and the Changing of the Guard , which we missed, takes place in four minutes time. While you get the impression that security is pretty relaxed in Monaco, the entire city (nation) is",
          "Certainly you should watch the changing of the guard if you can . I believe it starts about 11:50am . We also toured the palace itself and enjoyed that as well .",
          "Very average palace. I\u2019m well traveled and not intentionally trying be a snob about this, but what you get to actually see in the palace tour is a stone courtyard with modern pictures on the walls (you can\u2019t go in the courtyard, just look at it) then 5-6 small rooms inside,",
          "I visited the Palace of the Prince and for me it was fantastic. I am not interested in the cars museum so I only visited the Palace. Rooms were beautifully decorated. I loved the blue room; it is indeed a magical place. There are two big downsides that you need to know before",
          "The old town and Princes Palace was my favourite part of Monaco. The palace itself is very beautiful and the views you can see from it are worth the walk up.",
          "After a small trek, we were outside this beautiful palace. On the backside, you will be able to see the other part of Monaco and opposite the palace is the old town. Its got tiny streets which are usually busy and we enjoyed pizza and wine there. Definitely, the view is fabulous",
          "We got a chance to watch the changing of the guard during one of our stops with the day tour. It was definitely interesting with a choreographed drum match and Horner percussion during the change. Lots of people there as one would expect so definitely be there at least 15",
          "There is an entrance fee, I believe it is well worth the money ( I got my ticket from our coach guide 10 Euro). You are given a small audio guide in the language of your choice, if you follow its instructions, it will take you from room to room explaining most of the contents.",

          "Not much to add but it was a small tour with headsets that gave in an insite in the Royals and the past",
          "It worth to visit the palace, even if only a few rooms are visible during the approximately 30 mins tour what you can do with an audio guide within the building, however you can visit the room, where Grace Kelly was married! :)",
          "We booked the tickets for this in advance jointly with the oceanographic museum, the quibbled the tickets as they said they had to be used within two days but we had bought tickets for a specific day and already used them elsewhere so this was soon ironed out. They have an audio",

          "A palace overlooking a splendid place - does it really get any better? The Palace was full of tourists and we can see why! The architecture of the complex was staggering and definitely worth a visit just to admire the building! Truly spectacular.",
          "Visited with the family, really lovely place, with lovely gardens. Changing of the guard was great, really enjoyed it. We bought a ticket combo for the palace and the aquarium. The aquarium was outstanding and has a museum as well which was brilliant. The palace is having lots",

          "Great time in Monaco today. Rushed straight to the palace to see the \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d at 1155am. Very crowded, but great to see. Beautiful building with some great views from all sides. Some great souvenir shops around the square too.",
          "It's a nice enough looking palace , but been British we are spoilt !! We didn't go in , but we stayed to watch the changing of the guard which was worth doing . There's some lovely views from the square and a nice atmosphere around it well worth a visit , try and get there for",

          "A quick tour with audio guide in your language provided at no extra charge. It\u2019s not Buckingham Palace, but it\u2019s worth the combo ticket with the aquarium. Walkable from the aquarium and cute streets with food places for lunch right off the square. Always love seeing photos",
          "It seems that once you have paid your ticket , there is no more really to do . the presentation as well as the audioguide is very very minimal and there is no real logic in the exposition of furniture or rooms , i.e. the quicker you are out the more tickets they can sell. a non",
          "We bought a double pass up at the castle after asking for the castle and the car collection tickets, only to walk all the way back down the hill and around the other side to not be allowed into the car collection as the tickets were joint wiht the Aquarium. Not happy at all!",

          "Great stop on your Monaco visit. This pink building has a changing of the guard at 12, but be sure to get their earlier if you want a good view. If not, then wait until after the changing and have the square all to yourself. See the building up close Half is the permanent",

          "This is an \u201eactive\u201c palace so there\u2019s access only to some of the older state rooms. Beautifully decorated you see the gallery, arms room and a series of bed- and reception rooms. Audio guide a bit boring at times. Strictly no photography.",
          "Such a great place to be! Excellent overview of the rock, the palace is beautifully decorated. We got a tour and we also watched the change of guards. Highly recommend it.",
          "The palace from outside do not give its real image you must go inside yu can visit about 10 rooms it is 8 euro for adults",

          "Nice walk up the hill to the palace for some wonderful views of the marina below. The palace is very nice. Great little shops adjacent with great places to grab a bite to eat.",
          "It is a bit confusing that you buy your 8 euros entrance tickets from the shop and it isn't clear where the entrance to the Palace is - answer about 50 metres away. There wasn't a queue when we were there and you go through an airport style security bag check and are given",
          "There is not a lot \u201cto do\u201d here, but it is lovely for a stroll around the courtyard. It is neat to see the guards. It is fun to know that the Prince is home when the flag is flying. You will always see some VERY impressive vehicles around the area, as this area is well monied,",
          "The palace is a real treat, especially with the included tour audio devices, which help keep you on track for discovering all of the treasures in the palace. Great value, and very interesting. We bought the combo ticket which also included the aquarium, which proved to be very",

          "We purchased tickets for the private car collection and the palace for \u20ac11.50. The palace passed 20 minutes and was interesting to see how the rich live and lived. Impressive views from the outside. As you leave your given a 5% discount voucher for the gift shop.",
          "Great to spend sometime outside the palace looking at the views. The palace itself has some interesting bits but \u20ac8 addmission is the right price as it took me around 45 mins to do the full audio tour. Make sure your visit coincides with the 11:55am changing of the guard, well",
          "We wanted to see the palace and to be honest we\u2019re a little disappointed as there\u2019s. It much to see. You can go thru it 20 min or less. While all the rooms are beautiful and very well maintained, I was hoping for more information on the royal family. Maybe because they still",
          "The Prince's Palace is located high above the harbor. For those staying close to the harbor and unable to walk up (or prefer not to), the local bus and taxis can take you there. The views from the Prince's Palace were extraordinary and panoramic, and my favorite views of",

          "It's a bit of a strenuous walk up to this location but then again there's no rush - whilst the ascent from the harbour-side town area below can be challenging, so be warned, you can get here having had chance to sit and rest. We didn't go into the Palace .... obviously but it is",
          "If you are in Monaco, touring the Palace should be on your list of things to do - especially if you are visiting Monaco for the first time or if you think this is going to be the only time you ever visit. Just don\u2019t expect it to be as grand, large, or impressive as many other",
          "Our guide timed the trip to perfection as we arrived 5 minutes to 12 just as the soldiers were lining up for the changing of the guard....just a pity about 300 other people had the same idea.",
          "We stopped in here for the tour and the line took as much time as the tour did. The tour probably lasts about 25-30 minutes. It was nice to see the rooms and listen to the self guided tour. Rather interesting how the super wealthy lived. It is pretty much a quick history lesson",
          "Quite a walk up with steep steps, although enjoyable. However, you can now use lifts/escalators to get you some or all of the way up. Once there the views over the bay are lovely. There are benches, toilets etc at the top so you can relax looking at the views. We got there",
          "At 8 Euros entrance, including a good audio guide, a visit to the palace interior represents excellent value for money. You see twelve, generally lavish rooms, though I recommend you get there early before the bulk of the tourists arrive as I imagine the rooms soon get crowded.",
          "Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress it has been bombarded and overtaken by many foreign powers. Prince Rainier III is credited for restoring the Palace to its former glory. This was one of our stops on our tour for photo opportunities, but we did not take a tour of the inside.",
          "At 11:55 this event happens daily. Quite the pomp and circumstance involved. Definitely worth watching. Get there 20 minutes early as it does get crowded.",
          "I bought online ticket for couple months before I go to Monaco. The palace full of history but you can't access in many areas. There are staff and guards everywhere. I understand that royal family is living there. The souvenir coin in front of the palace is very nice. You can",
          "Came to the palace to watch the change of guard, was really great very very busy but highly recommended",
          "It is situated at the west side of the port, not very well signposted and is quite a walk up the hill, but well worth it. After reaching the top there are lovely small streets with shops, cafes and restaurants, we seemed to arrive at the perfect time 12noon to see the changing",
          "I had the chance to visit this Prince's Palace in Monaco last Summer, but it was not all open to visitors and the tour was very limited place. However; it was a nice visit to be acquainted with this type of Monarchies.",
          "The steps up to it are steep so might be hard to get up in a wheel chair I no you can get a taxi up to it , the palace was closed when we where there but you could see the changing of the guards , there are lovely shops and restaurants up there and break taking views of Monaco",
          "My favorite attractions were the changing of the guard and the beautiful view of the two ports. The visit inside the palace was interesting but the section open to the public is quite small.",
          "A small but nice Palace in a fabulous square offering stunning views over Monte Carlo and the surrounding areas. The guards frequently march in front of the Palace and look very smart in their uniforms. Well worth a visit, even for the views from the square.",
          "Beautiful building. Didn\u2019t go inside and missed the changing of guards but the guards walking around looked very smartly dressed.",
          "After arriving at the train station we headed straight to the Prince's Palace end of Monaco. Being so hilly it can be quite a difficult place to navigate, you cannot walk straight to anything. After climbing up to the Princes Palace there were a lot of people crowded around,",
          "This was the final point of our walk through Monaco. Great construction and offers a nice panoramic view.",
          "Immaculate and preened this royal fantasy has to be seen. Try to avoid when the cruise boaters arrive but there is room for all. One of the Top 10 in Monaco.",
          "Beautiful palace with stunning views of the ocean and the yacht. Waited to see the parade of the changing guards. The very nice place to hang around for the whole day.",
          "I forgot to make this review about Monaco\u2019s Palace, but besides being F1 weekend, it was Prince Albert\u2019s wedding the following week or so, the city looked amazing, the Palace grounds were being prepared with fresh planted flowers, everything, though seeming perfect, was being",
          "The changing of the guard occurred at 5 to noon. It only lasts 5 minutes. The palace itself was not open this month.",
          "Monaco was the highlight of our trip. So beautiful! We visited in January when it was very quiet but still warm. What a magnificent palace.",
          "The palace itself is nice with guards standing outside and I believe they have some sort of changing of the guards. However the views nearby overlooking the sea are absolutely breathtaking",
          "Loved entering this palace, it was well organized tour with lots of nice historical information that i found very interesting and i enjoyed my visit.",
          "The palace is not as embellished as many of the palaces in other parts of Europe but it is still interesting to watch the changing of the guard take place. The square is blocked to some traffic during the changing of the troops at the post across from the palace.",
          "The palace is on top of the hill but I don't think you can go inside the palace, On both side there is quite a view especially on the side overlooking the beautiful harbor- really breathtaking. You may go back by bus or just walk, there is pathway going down.",
          "The palace itself is nice, a bit plain but still interesting if you like royalty. But it's well worth spending a bit of time up there as the views on both ends of the palace are amazing!",
          "The building looks new, but cant be! Interesting soldier guards out front. Lots of security in the vicinity. Great views.",
          "Monte Carlo and Monaco in general could be skipped if it were not for the fame the city state has. We went to Monaco out of curiosity while in Nice. We could have stayed in Nice and not really missed anything...but on with the Prince\u2019s Palace! The palace sits on top of a hill",
          "Nice place for a Palace with downward looking vertical views of the harbors on both sides. While we were visiting the area all we could see was the outside of the Palace building and the Palace guard as the Palace interior was closed for the season. The view of the two harbors",
          "We have visited here twice this year, it is well worth the walk up, the views from either side of the square are breath taking",
          "They do a fantastic job of managing the crowds. We were here the end of July and though it was crowded, the very informative audio tour keep the lines moving at a pleasant pace. It was a wonderful day.",
          "I love the place ! My daughter and her baby enjoyed it a lot. It has a magnificent view everywhere. Although some shops are close on a sunday there were small shops that were open. I can always go back there again and again and not get tired. However we ha",
          "Take the lift up to the hill and get great views over Monaco Be there for 1145 hrs for the changing of the guard Then stroll the streets in the area",
          "A beautiful palace and square fit for a prince. Not crowded and good for a stroll to the many restaurants and gelaterrias and cafes in the area. Lots of kitchsy touristy souvieniers to be found everywhere. The guards were still in their summer white uniforms and have a grand",
          "The mount on which the palace sits overlooks the main city and the Monte Carlo neighborhood, along with its iconic waterfront. The palace itself is a clean and simple design, so take a few photos there. Then walk a few meters away and take some shots of the spectacular view",
          "This tour reminds one that a well told tale can enhance the image of even a small company, attraction or country. The princes palace tour makes one think Monaco is more important that it is or has been and does show off the ruling family in a favorable light. Each room visited",
          "The palace is amazing. Lots of historical sites to see. The changing of the guards is a must see. The view is amazing. Many great little restaurants to eat at while you are there. Some shops but wasn't really impressed with them . Lots of people. You can ride up and down",
          "While the Palace is not a huge place, it is interesting to see where the royal family live. Long lines to tour so we just looked around outside. The Palace is also situated on a square in front of it which has all kinds of souvenir shops.",
          "Monaco is a lovely place but filled to the brim with tourists. The palace and the changing of the guard were interesting but not the best of Europe. Yet, who could miss the place where Grace Kelly became royalty?",
          "Well kept grounds, a beautiful palace. It is worth visiting the area and spectacular views of the marina.",
          "Can only see the outside of building with a standing guard. Nothing really impressive. Happens to have a change of guard and captured the video.",
          "Fascinating view of the Royal family and its history. Beautiful palace with some great exhibits and interesting commentary on the mobile guide.",
          "Perched high on a rock the Grimaldi family palace looks resplendent in the sunshine. The audio guided tour is excellent. There is so much history attached to the place. Best of all is the changing of the Palace guard at 11.55 daily.",
          "Not many rooms to see, but the blue room and one bedroom are especially awesome. You can tour it all in less than one hour. The old town across the square has some lovely buildings, but is mostly shops with T shirts.",
          "An impressive looking palace set in a large square with nearby views over the harbour, the entrance ticket can be combined with either the Oceanographic institute or the car collection, but oddly, not both. Nonetheless, prices seemed quite reasonable. A free audio guide was",
          "I loved this palace and the faculty it looked very normal compared to some of the other Palaces we have seen throughout Europe, it does not show off its wealth. It's located in a lovely square with 2 look out areas, one of the ocean and the other of stunning Monaco. Hey I could",
          "I would suggest starting by getting there around 1130h and heading over to the ticket office to purchase your ticket for the Palace tour. There is a 30 minute or so audio guide that you get when yo check in. If you are looking at the palace front turn to your left and head over",
          "As much as I enjoyed getting to see this it is quite expensive depending on which tour you do. However for \u20ac8 each to see the palace it is beautiful. There is however limited rooms to see and our of respect to the family still living there no photos are allowed. Which is",
          "I can imagine that during high season, this place can be a zoo, but when we were there it was very easy. There are tours of the Palace available but we opted out.",
          "Must see the changing of the guards. Quite a bit of pomp and ceremony around this. Impressive palace set on top of the hill with a beautiful view over the harbour",
          "Not too grand a place but interesting all the same. It is quite compact as you only get to see a few rooms that are still in use. There is an interesting room with some of the previous monarchs paintings. The most interesting one though is Princess Grace and Rainier with their",
          "It is so natural that you love this place, simple atmosphere, and changing of the guards happens every hour.",
          "Location and views from gardens are awesome. We climbed the steps from Monte Carlo. It not that difficult. In old town in front of the palace you can find souvenirs and food.",
          "There are buses but me and my family decided to walk my mother she managed the walk ok when you get to the top there are markets to buy drinks and snacks that are priced ok. The views are good and walking down is a lot easier then waling up.",
          "Make sure to get a coupon book at the visitor center in the train station (go up the escalators) to get \u20ac2 euro off the entrance fee. The palace itself is very plain on the outside but just gorgeous inside with its Renaissance frescoes and paintings as well as architecture. I",
          "The walk up to the Princes Palace is via a long staircase which has long evenly spaced out stairs which can be used by wheelchairs and pushchairs. On the walk up you are gifted with the most beautiful views of the harbour and all the fine boats. We were not expecting to find",
          "Palace is situated overlooking Monte Carlo. We only had a short time to visit so didn't get to go inside. Wasn't too expensive looking at prices in ticket office, would like to have seen the car collection. Saw the changing of the guard, a little bit amateur, and they weren't",
          "I thought the Prince's Palace was a little small inside and it did not take long to look around. This is to be expected, with Monaco being such a small country it's royal palace was unlikely to rival those in other major european capitals.",
          "This was worth a quick visit. I'd recommend getting the audio guide, as it gives a nice amount of information. There is only a small portion of the palace open to visitors as the royal family still actually live and work there.",
          "Definitely visit here. I learned so much about the monarchy and the history of Monaco. This is a must see!",
          "Witness the change of guards in the Palace. Beautiful seaview, mountains, luxurious yachts, expensive houses & great buildings is a WOW feeling. Restaurants and coffee shops are a bit pricey compare to other eu countries. but a must try. The view of the city is amazing! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "This is a goodplace for walking around and take pics. Also you can see the the changing of the guard.",
          "The Palace isn't amazing, I have seen more elaborate Palaces but what i loved about it was the homely feel, the cosiness of the palace and you could imagine the Grimaldi's feeling totally at home here. You get to see some of the bedrooms, the throne room and the famous flight of",
          "Prince's Palace is a must when touring Monaco because of its fantastic views. Although the hike up many stairs to get to the Palace is brutal, it is well worth it. There are many shops and restaurants along with the huge palace. The views of Monaco are the best part, as they",
          "before seeing the palace take a walk round the old town on top of the hill ,visit the cathedral and gardens. i thought 8 euros was a fair entrance price which includes a audio tours .the tour takes about an hour. from the palace you get some great views of the port",
          "Went for a walk up to the palace. But that's about it. Never found it worth to go inside. Nothing special.",
          "Beautiful area where you can get up close to the prince's palace. You have to walk uphill to get there so wear comfortable shoes. Walking would be tough for those who can't walk for long. Once you get up, enjoy the views of Monaco and the harbor. We were there in the",
          "Another must if visiting Monte-Carlo. The palace is regal and captivating. Take a stroll through the narrow streets, visit the churches and stop to browse in the many shops or just have a coffee and watch the world go by. A spectacular view to take photographs looking down on",
          "This was a grade guided tour of Monaco we walked from the harbour, to the Oceanography museum, then throught the gardens to St Paul's Church, where we spent 10 minutes in there. we then walked up to the Palace just in time to see the chaning of the guards which is a must see",
          "We were here with the family, but we have not visited inside the palace. We took some pictures outside, of the palace and the great view from this area, saw the soldiers marching, and went for souvenirs shopping in the small streets around the palace.",
          "Visited here with a teenager; we bought the tickets and audio guide was great! Easy to use and very informative. Definitely get up and go early though, then you can see the changing of the guard afterwards. Interesting visit.",
          "We bought a combined e-ticket to visit the palace and the oceanographic museum of Monaco. Despite that we were waiting under the sun for 45 minutes to visit this palace.It was not what we expected to see. Small and without any impressive items. Since most visitors stay in Monaco",
          "Not too big and really cute. A must see in Monaco. The architecture of this Palace is beautiful. It wasn't crowded at all. I didn't do the visit but next time I come, I'd definitely do it.",
          "We did not plan our visit in advance and purchased the aquarium/palace ticket package....very glad we did! Very interesting to the whole family to see the active and historic residence, including rooms and furniture apparently used by previous 'tenants'! The audio guide was very",
          "The palace is on a lovely square where you can watch the changing of the guard. We missed that but friends said that they really enjoyed it. You get an audio tour so that the apartments can be viewed at your own pace and in your own language. Only part of the palace can be",
          "Walking inside the castle that is actually the residence of the current prince is worth a visit. We did not manage to get the introduced, but the audio guided tour helps you to understand the background of mono a, a better understanding of the Grimaldi's and a sneak peek in some",
          "We were at the palace half-hour before the change of guard at 11:55 am. Walking around the plaza and then seeing the short ceremony was regal. Then we went to visit the open areas of the palace and it was great. Some of the rooms are used for official functions and it's the",
          "Beautiful small palace in a cute plaza. Restaurant and shop in streets around.quite a treck up the stairs but beautiful view and lift always available like anywhere in Monaco.",
          "It is the must see when you visit the principality. This is the official residence of the seat of power in Monaco currently Prince Albert. The history is interesting and palace is one of the best maintained in the World. I am often surprised so many visitors never see one of the",
          "Definitely worth the visit. The prince's palace is the place of residency of Prince Albert II of Monaco. You get a recorder as a guide with the entry fee",
          "Very interesting visit to the Palace, I saw the palace in magazines so many times and walking inside was very interesting, I saw the palace was bigger inside, specially the throne room",
          "We walked to the top of the mountain to visit the Princes Palace (we did not go inside the palace as we where short on time- tickets where about 8 Euro per adult for the palace and 12 Euro for the palace and car collection per adult). The Princes Palace offers unbelievable views",
          "We visited this through the discounted dual ticket of the Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique a bit further. It's nice to visit and if you're a fan of the XVI-XIXth century castles you'll be fulfilled. If you're not, then you can skip this.",
          "You will only be able to see a few rooms of the palace, but all them are worth it, in particular for the price asked. It is very rich yet it is not very posh, which is a rare combination.",
          "Lovely to visit Monaco and the Pink Palace! Take bottles of water as it's some climb up to the top! Stunning views and gorgeous wee streets off the palace to eat/ shop and browse the property prices! Loved it \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Well I guess it's cool to have seen it but it's not really something to look forward to. The small alleys nearby though is very nice to walk and have a pizza in. The view is pretty good as well.",
          "We arrived and walked here in the early morning, outside the palace are great views of the city.Very interesting visit with audio, stories about each room. But a litte bit expensive",
          "The entire square is lovely and a timeless place to experience the Royalty, that is Monaco. One could spend the whole day wandering and taking the place where Princess Grace lived. It's just wonderful!",
          "Lovely place visit with audio although not enough of the place revealed . Rooms are beautiful with antique paintings and furniture. I don't think Albert has changed anything for the last 400 years",
          "Our visit got a pissy start as the person selling the tickets would not sell us a student ticket even though we had an international student card. She just kept incisting that it could be anything. The card is quite modern as you only have it on your phone ect. and it has all",
          "Had limited time - so didn't do the tour - but a must visit place when in Monaco. A great viewpoint from both sides - where you will have great photo opportunities.",
          "The self-guided tour is interesting enough but it's quite pricey and no photos are allowed to fuel one's memories. Be warned, airport security with priority to tour groups and so we stood in the sun for 20 minutes waiting for a party of aged Germans to come to grips with",
          "We walked up to here whilst exploring Monaco and then did the train tour. It is a very steep walk but a pretty one. It was a busy hot day and we did watch the changing of the guards which was fascinating to watch. How they cope in the heat baffles me! Amazing views of the port",
          "Walked past here but didn't go inside. It was very crowded due to the guard procession. Seems to be the centerpiece Monaco tour.",
          "The self-guided tour of the palace includes some amazingly decorated rooms, including the throne room. The tour includes an audio guide which was interesting and talked about some specific paintings or items in each room, and provides a brief overview of the history of the royal",
          "Walking along the port, I took steep stairs to reach Prince's Palace of Monaco that has been transformed into one of the most luxurious residences in the world. he magnificent Throne Room is where all official ceremonies, such as swearing-in-of-high ranking state officials and",
          "This was a reasonably priced tour and if time is short it does not take too long. It was very interesting and we both enjoyed it . The audio guides had us rather confused at the beginning - we had walked on too far and had to retrace our steps! We walked up to the palace and the",
          "A palace which is still inhabited and it is not only a museum. Since the end of the 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family until todays. The palace is a blend of architectural styles and the rooms contain ornate 18th-century French-style",
          "Being in Monaco there were a couple things on our list that we had to do. The Palace tour being one. It is very reasonable to get in. You can buy your tickets in advance which is nice being that the crowds grow thru out the day. It is a recorded tour thru the palace. It is",
          "The Palace looks like new! It has guards marching in front of the entrance. It is the residence of Prince Albert de Monaco.",
          "We caught the local bus 100 from Nice to Monaco, a great choice and it costs only 1.50 \u20ac per person one way. It runs every 15 minutes and the trip takes about 30-45 minutes travelling along the coastline. We were there only a few days prior to the Formula 1 car race so the town",
          "The palace itself is beautiful to behold. Our driver had to park a short walk away and direct us on foot to visit the site. It's located on a courtyard accessed by many narrow streets with many vendors and shoppes. There is limited auto access to this courtyard at the front",
          "I went to the palace during the changing of the guards, and that was really cool to see! It was a bit of a walk up there, but I'm pretty sure there are buses as well. The palace is really pretty and the area around it is very cute as well. A lot of restaurants and souvenir",
          "We couldnt get near because of some maintenance works. Guard in front of palace. Palace which is amazing. Historic surrounding. Really nice view for eyes.",
          "We stopped off here at the palace for a tour, after our picnic lunch near the palace, which was very nice. It is a beautiful palace but not so big that you get to tired to finish the tour. I was very impressed with the tour and it was just the right length of time that you",
          "We thought the palace would be like the casino as far as the grandeur but the rooms seemed old and small. The history is nice and the audio tour is helpful...but it was 'OK'. The views are pretty from up top. Make sure you take time walking the gardens going down to the",
          "Possibility to see some places of the palace. Honestly I was a bit disappointed because I expected to see more and because neither could take photos nor film.",
          "About half of the palace is open to tourists. It is well worth the wait to go through and view the history, furnishings, antiques of the Monaco royalty. Self guided tour so you can spend longer at items you want to review. No pictures allow in the palace, strictly enforced.",
          "The cost to visit this Palace was 8Euros per adult, however you can buy a combination ticket to include the Aquarium or the Motor car museum which is a good saving, however we visited the motor museum first and they did not tell us this, so we paid full price admission at both",
          "Climb the steps to the Prince's Palace (toilets available half way up!) and you are rewarded with stunning views of Monaco, the pretty palace and narrow streets of gift shops and reasonably priced cafes. We enjoyed sitting in the shade with a 5 euro baguette in the beautiful",
          "The Prince's Palace is well worth a visit when in Monaco. The palace gives you a great introduction into the life of Monaco's rich and famous. The entrance fee of 8 euros takes you through many of the rooms showing examples of great wealth and includes many portraits of the",

          "Certainly worth the visit and 8 euros entry. Most enjoyable and interesting. Lovely antiques and furniture in all of the rooms and excellent audio to accompany the visit.Regards Gary Saunders.",
          "You can either walk up or arrive by the sightseeing Red Bus on it's route by the Palace. Try to get there to see the changing of the guard. The Palace itself is very interesting.",
          "Sorry to be negative but I wish we had not visited. The tour (audio tour) took us 10 minutes and we waited twenty. You get to see @ 4 rooms and you get no real flavour of the family except in the last cheesy painting of all of them together. Luckily it is only \u00a38 but I would",
          "The palace looks good, but that's really all there is to it. I did not go inside the palace, only watched from outside. It's not a must to go here.",
          "Partially visible at the top of the hill rather spectacular as the highest point in downtown Monaco.",
          "The Palace offers an audio-guided tour and to our surprise greek was included in the languages offered, so my parents were able to be totally independent! The actual exhibition and the walk-through the Palace's rooms is well-arranged and, on a rather slow pace, the whole tour",
          "Very interesting visit with an amazing guide who took us through the palace telling us very interesting stories about each room, its decoration and the objects.",
          "Very popular and beautiful place to visit ,you can't make any pictures for security reasons , so keep your eyes wide open",
          "Well worth the walk up to the top to see the palace, also offers various restaurants, side cafes to stop for refreshments. The small Monaco train also runs up and down to if you don't fancy the steps up",
          "The main part of town doesn't have a coastal walk that gives the best views. But up at the palace the view is great! I'd recommend heading up the hill just for the view and to see the guards do their thing.",
          "Not something we had on our list to visit but glad we did. They supply audio for you so you can get information on each room you see. We went on a Sunday and were quite surprised that it was not very busy. Found the history very interesting. Was a little disappointed we could",
          "This was a great way to get some background on the palace and the royalty that have lived there. It is a self paced audio tour with units for different languages. The whole tour took under an hour. There are no pictures allowed so plan accordingly.",
          "The palace had a lot to see and each room was very detailed. I enjoyed it but disappointed you couldn't take photos.",
          "We had to visit this palace, since we had heard the story of Princess Grace and Prince Ranier since we were kids. Audio guides (like cell phones) are provided in your preferred language, and they do a good job of directing the tourist to the relevant areas and describing the",
          "Go for the view from the top, the town looks so beautiful. The narrow streets, beautiful Palace and the changing event of the Palace guards was an excellent experience. Small cafes and restaurants with local delicacies is plus.",
          "The visit here was more about the family history than of Princess Grace. The princess occupied a good portion of the tour, but the family history before and after Grace provided a detailed invite of this remarkable family.",
          "The climb up to Monaco-Ville, the old fortified city on the Rock which includes the Prince's Palace, Cathedral and Oceanographic Museum is on a gentle gradient but steep enough to make you 'feel' the climb. Stop on the way up and take photos out over the bay of the marina full",
          "This tour takes around 30mins, the history is fascinating, the audio device you're given describes each room or item of interest, the rooms you visit account for a very small part of the overall palace, but you get a great idea of how the other half live.",
          "We went to the Prince\u00b4s Palace not for the Palace but for the wonderful and spectacular view over Monaco. It was worth the effort of climbing some steps. The view is awesome. If you can, try to catch sunset from this top spot. There are some nice bars at the large square where",
          "We spent a half day visiting this place. We got luck when we came they changed guards. We could enjoy the view to surrounding areas. The place is super-clean. We would come back definitely.",
          "Really enjoyed this, spent a couple of hours wandering around looking at the palace and cathedral and area. We walked up but did not realize there was a lift! Great views and wonderful gardens, so much more here then we thought.",
          "It is self guided audio tour through a few of the public rooms of the palace where the prince lives. Beautiful, but nothing particularly noteworthy. This part of the palace is still used for formal events, but as expected you are roped off into hallways and only see one wing",
          "Recently visited here as part of a trip for my girlfriends birthday. We were not disappointed with our visit to the palace and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Monaco. The tour itself is very informative and talks you through all the various rooms and grandeur of",
          "We purchased our tickets ahead of time to visit the palace, but you can buy at the door. They are not open year-round so worth looking into when they are open. We purchased the tickets that gives you access to the Prince's car collection also. We had someone in line with us",
          "Absolutely stunning view from the top of the mountain in Monaco. Old and very scenic building that you can photograph and look at for hours.. - VeloceInternational.com",
          "More than a few steps from the marina, the walk up the hill is invigorating and worth the views of the Mediterranean, gardens and Garibaldi palace. The changing of the guard is held precisely at 11:55 which is worth the time to wait and see. Not as grandiose as the Buckminster",
          "Climb a few steps from the street/marina level and you'll be up in the clouds over looking Monaco marina, the view extends past the marina out into the ocean but also back over to the city. Over the other side of the square/courtyard there is a view of the smaller marina (Port",

          "Walked from the train station to the palace and arrived just as a changing of the guard was in progress. Great views from the surroundings. Trinket and cap shops proliferate on the narrow streets, along with small cafes and street food. There are an uncommon number of beautiful",

          "somehow curious to cross borders just walking on a street, that little gem Monaco, elegant, precious and so normal. felling good, just a sensation of something different but good, I feel kind of the same in Manhattan. hard to explain, let say is a bit of magic.",
          "Incredible views after climbing the numerous steps up to the palace, but unfortunately once we were there, we were unable to go in there. The streets are the area surrounding it are lovely, and feel very 'french', but overall, would only visit for the views.",
          "If this was the only reason to stop in Monaco, then one can pass. It is nice and quaint with streets literally cleaned every day but you cannot visit inside. It almost feels like an attraction made for tourists only despite being an actual historical building. Nice views",
          "This was a must for us on our day trip. We caught the hop on hop off tour bus, great way to get around Monaco. We made sure we got here for the changing of the guard, 11 oclock .What a great performance. The place was really clean and you had great views over Monaco. Really",
          "Historial building, no glittery decorations, just nice and clean. You are not allowed to visit inside, but the building and the surroundings are well worth the trip up there anyway. The old town on the castle hill is in great contrast to the rest of Monaco.",
          "This is a great way to have fantastic views over the city. It is spotlessly clean and very picturesque. Lots of little shops and place to eat. Highly recommended",
          "The historic area of Monaco is actually very pretty... the Prince's Palace is beautiful. The entire area is charming and is worth a day of exploring. I can't say as much for the Monte Carlo area... busy with lots of 60's high rises... though the casino itself is pretty. If",
          "Nice views of the bay from the top, you can't visit inside the Palace, there are a few guards at the entrance.",
          "Whilst in Monte-Carlo on a business trip with colleagues we had a free day. A walk along the Harbour then up to the Palace for 11am to see the changing of the guard. The views were beautiful. A visit around the shops in all the narrow streets around the old part of",
          "Very nice building in the midst of a large square. The palace is located near many apartments as well as churches and a museum. Unlike other palaces that are hidden away from the public in the countryside or other private locations, it's amongst the public.",
          "You will certainly pass by the palace when visiting the old city of Monaco, but there isn't much to see of the palace from outside",
          "Having been to Buckingham Palace & Versailles earlier on our honeymoon trip, my wife & I weren't overly impressed with this Palace, as there was nothing special about it and the walk up to the top was quite long. Don't get me wrong though, the Palace looks big and the guard",
          "We are from Philadelphia, home of Princess Grace Kelly, so this was the highlight of my European tour. The headphones were great for the boys, ages 11,10 and 8. We loved seeing the changing of the guard ceremony. Would like to have seen more information about seeing the",
          "Nothing amazing, just your usual huge european palace with a changing of the guard but if you are here in Monte Carlo of course check it out. Walking just a little bit away from palace gives incredible views though of the harbor and the city",
          "Came here when on our holiday . A slight walk up the hill however great views over the harbour , port and the town. Great places for pictures. Also you will be able to see the guards outside.",
          "The Palace is situated on a hill. A bit of a walk but spectacular views all around on the way up. Punctuate the walk up by stopping and taking some lovely shots of Monaco. We were unable to see the changing of the guards...we were there the wrong day. Lots of boutique-like",
          "The square on which Prince's Palace sits is perched on top of the hill where there's magnificent views of the entirety of Monaco. The harbour in Monaco is called Port Hercules. Cause there\u2019s gonna be plenty of big yachts and big cruise ships making port. This cathedral just",
          "Just fine. Not much to see there, though there are surprising many amazing secret spots to discover, if you are smart..",
          "The Prince's Palace of Monaco was home of the Grimaldi family, it's perfectly located in one of the highest parts of the city with a beautiful view perfect to spot the whole harbor and city, Be there for the changing of the guards, it's a must!",
          "We were brought here on a guided tour and so were in time to see the changing of the guard at noon. A little band marches out and there's a lot of ceremonial presentation of arms and the like.",
          "We queued in the hot sun to enter the palace reception where security was tight and unfriendly. We picked up an audio guide and ambled through the rooms where the history of the first family of this Principality was told. Most of it was interesting. I found the artifacts",
          "The views from the top are really good, loads to see from up there and there's loads to do in Monaco in general",
          "Coming here requires a little bit of effort but it is worthy. Although we were not able to enter in the palace, we found it very beautiful.",
          "It's a fairly steep climb up the stairs to the Palace, but affords a great view of Monaco. The changing of the guard is daily at 11.55 am, not all that interesting but we were lucky to see the Prince and family arrive with a very big police bike escort into the Palace just",
          "Typically if you are traveling from Nice or other close areas you will have 1/2 a day to roam around and get lost in Monaco. This is definitely something you should do when you get there... and do it right when you are there. The fee for the tour is minimal but you will learn",
          "The changing of the gaurd was interesting, but otherwise rather boring looking at the building. Do the Prince and Princess live there?",
          "Although it was not possible to visit palace itself at a time of our visit, it'd still worth to walk up to see its main entrance. Quite nice and picturesque building indeed.",
          "Like all good travelers, if you go to Monaco, you must go to the Palace and watch the changing of the Guard. It's a bit of a climb, whether you walk along the sea wall or take a route through the City so you don't want to be disappointed for your effort. However, fate had other",
          "We happened to be in the area when the Changing of the Guard was taking place. It was enjoyable to see how this is done and the precision of the guard.",
          "I have rated the attraction highly more for the area than the Palace itself. Whilst the latter was interesting to some extent, I found it to be without great character and was actually more interested in the old-town alley ways and adjoining square. Sure, the place is a tourist",
          "Worth the walk up from the main town. Good vies of Port Hercule on way up.Not a very large Palace but seeped in history. The day I visited there was no changing of the guard. Very busy, lots of tourist.",
          "It is worth to visit but I must point out, if you expect this palace like any other ones you had seen, it is not really comparable. It is very small and simple. The old town around the palace is a must see, so I guess you will make the trip and see both. The aquarium near by",
          "We only had one day to visit Monaco as a day trip from Nice and it was pouring rain. Since walking around was out, a tour of Palais was a great choice. Given that this still a \"working building\" access is limited to one side, but what we saw was amazing. The English audio",
          "The tour of the palace was not guided. I received a free audio set for 30 stations after palace guards and security machine inspected my bag/purse. The stations were for various public rooms like the reception room, the throne room, a memorial bedroom for the Duke of York who",
          "Please be noticed that we only saw it from the outside--- The view from the hill and the way up are quite nice. The entire place looks neat and clean as is the entire state. Police presence everywhere which is not annoying at all. There is one police officer per 68 people which",
          "It is a beautiful palace worth seeing while in Monte Carlo. It is advisable to first buy the entry ticket. After security you are provided with audio guide. The photography is not allowed inside. Each room has got its own charm and history. The furniture and paintings are",
          "We had to wait in line in the hot sun for this. I have to say that I found it to be over-the-top ugly, with tons on gold leaf, room after oppressing room of it. There was a shockingly bad portrait of the royal family. I thought, \"You have got to be kidding.\" Then we went",
          "you should buy a ticket first and then stand in line. the line was fast and after 20 min. we went inside of palace. firs our bag was checked and then we got the audio guide. you can not take any picture inside the palace. there are many beautiful room with Complete explanations.",
          "The changing of the guard was a great experience. The Prince employs only people Monaco. Anyone in the employ of the Prince is except from taxes. The guards must retire by 55.",
          "The Palais du Prince is worth seeing if you are in Monaco. It's well organized and well curated and you learn a little bit of Monaco's interesting history, but really it's not all that exciting and probably doesn't need to be done twice.",
          "Nice walk all the way up to the castle, with beautiful scenery all around. The change of the guards is a must see as well, I think it's about 11:30-12 noon.",
          "Nice to see but not really worth the entry fee and you are not allowed to take any photos which is a shame.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the palace. Be sure to rent the tour cassette because it provides you with an in depth analysis of the palace, the furniture and the architecture. There's so much to see of the long history of the Grimaldis throughout the self guided tour. The",
          "Its an impressive and interesting place to visit. Crowds gather for changing of the guards, which is worth a watch if your in the area at the time. The square is surrounded by shop and a couple of narrow shop filled streets. Its a really nice walk down the coast line from here",
          "We walked up the the top of the rock to where this palace sits and there is an old town opposite great for a walk around the shops. We then saw a ticket office for the palace and as they were cheap we brought them to go in. The palace has lots and lots of history in there so",
          "Located in the old town up on 'The Rock', there is a steep climb or you can get the Hop-on Hop-off Tour bus. Entry costs \u20ac8 and there is an informative easy to use 45 minute audio guide available in a number of languages. You are not allowed to take photos and this is a shame",
          "We wanted to visit at least two sites on our day trip to Monaco. The Prince's Palace was the first and we were not disappointed. We arrived in time for the changing of the guard, just before noon. There were a lot of people for that and we thought the palace would be overrun by",
          "This is my favourite place in Monaco after yachts view there. Everything in the Palace is in a relation with a Grace Kelly, which is one of my favourite women in the whole world. There is many rooms, which everyone can see when you visit the palace.",
          "The views from the palace are absolutely stunning and worth the stair climb to take in the scenery. The palace was lovely and lavishly furnished my particular favourite was the Blue room. The walls are lined with a gorgeous blue silk, and matching upholstered furniture. Each",
          "It is worth the walk up the hill to see the Princes Palace and the shops around the palace area are great. The view over the Monaco harbour area is amazing and when we were visiting the yacht show was on and the buzz in the area is amazing. The ocean as far as you could see was",
          "If you go to Monaco, be sure to get to the palace for the 11:55am changing of the guard. This is only about 10-15 minutes. Take the palace tour while you are there. You see some beautiful rooms and learn more about the royal family. I enjoyed my visit to the palace.",
          "I visited during a trip with my husband and found this to be a must see. For a leisurely trip with a busy day ahead we decided to get the bus which was cheap \u20ac2 and easy. The numbers 1&2 run regularly. The changing of the guard really should be included in any trip up here. We",
          "another must go visit in monaco. I love the room s and the history gehind each of them. price is on the average of others atraction on europe.",
          "Stunning palace and simple but very enjoyable tour of the palace rooms etc. View from the top are wonderful and you also get to watch the changing of the guards. Entry to the palace in only 8 euros and has a good audio guided tour",
          "We enjoyed walking through the small portion of the palace that is open to the public. The headset audio was good. Disappointing that I couldn't take any pictures...",
          "if nothing else, for the view. the square in front is quite beautiful too. we missed the changing of the guard but heard that is fun.",
          "Lovely building surrounded by lots of old typically French buildings Nothing else much to see. Very touristy and crowded but better that Monte Carlo!",
          "A nice modern palace with beautiful wall-paintings, furniture and pictures, but one is not admitted to take pictures and the bigger part of the palace is not open to external visitors",
          "Palace look like out of a fairy tale. Necessarily see it . Tickets for apartments of the Palace can be taken from the pavilion against him.",
          "This is a very simple building, but stands out as a very clean building. We had explained to us where the Prince and his family live, as we were not allowed in.",
          "This prince's palace was so much better than I thought it would be. I love everything royalty, but I felt like they were so close to me when I toured this palace. It's down to earth, staff is friendly and not super busy. Lovely visit!",
          "A nice way to fill in an hour - an audio guide is a must. What awesome views too. 11.55 am to see the changing of the guards. We went by bus from Nice which was easy (bus 100)",
          "We had a lovely time at the palais; the rooms are stunning and the paintings gorgeous. However, there are no labels in English, and the audio guide did not give us much information on Monaco or the history of the principality or monarchy as we expected, but more a history of the",
          "It is a steep climb up to the palace that may affect someone that has breathing/walking problems but well worth the visit. There is a charge to visit. Although you are limited to what the palace can show it was still interesting to see how the royals live and that it was once",
          "I just wish we had more time as a group to actually go inside. From the outside it is very nice and it is a must see in Monaco.",
          "The palace is the private residence of the ruling Prince of Monaco, H.S.H. Prince Albert ll, and for \u20ac8 you can view the State Apartments. The Changing of the Guard is free and takes place at 11:55am. For the best view, line up as close as you can, facing the archway of the",
          "We bought tickets for the Palace and Car museum. Children 18 and under \u20ac5 each and adults\u20ac11.50 each. Quick turnover at box office and good service. Waited at front of queue to enter the Palace where we had to wait about 10 minutes to allow a large group of visitors in before",
          "I was somewhat annoyed having walked up the hill from Port Hercule to do the tour of the State rooms. On arrival I was promptly told to go to the ticket office which I did, when I returned a female staff member rather abruptly told me to stay still why she dealt with the person",
          "Visited the palace in August when on a cruise trip. You buy your entrance ticket at the gift shop opposite the palace and then queue to enter. We watched the changing of the guard ceremony first at 11.55am and then toured the palace. Interesting to compare the palace to British",
          "Built in 1191, this palace is the official residence of the Prince of Monaco. The palace acquired glamour in 1950s when famous Hollywood actress Grace Kelly married the prince and became chateline of the palace. The architecture of facade of the palace is as per renaissance",
          "Everything in Monaco for me seem all first class from place to place to visit so posh, so beautiful, mostly people so kind while driving, always give us a way to cross the road. I love whole Monaco.",
          "Very informative tour. Beautifully narrated. Would definitely recommend doing the tour while in Monaco.",
          "While visiting the aquarium they asked us if we wanted to visit it just adding 50 cents more. We accepted and the visit in this palace was great. A lot of things to see and the audio guide explain a lot of information. If you are lucky you can also see the change of the guard",
          "Only about 8 euros to tour the palace but well worth it. The audio tour takes you room by room and explains the history of the Palace. Not quite as spectacular as Versaille but great none the less. Also, the changing of the guard was cool. Again, not quite as majestic as in",
          "The Prince\u2019s Palace is the site where the Grimaldi family has ruled Monaco. The palace is the official private residence of the Prince of Monaco, Albert II. There is a legend that in 1297 Francois Grimaldi disguised himself as a monk and was admitted to the fortress. Once",
          "You have a great view of the city, you can actually imagine how they were defending themselves 2-3 hundreds years ago, i've been there on tine for the prince's guard changing (between 11:45-12:15 midday) and it was absolutely stunnig .",
          "If you have not visited Buckingham Palace and not seen Change of Guards then do not fret....this is almost close to it. There is a souvenir and ticket shop from where you need to buy the tickets. They have special deals like the palace with the oceanographic museum together or",
          "Lovely architecture and square (glad to get lost on way from train station to aquarium). Great view.",
          "It is a little bit different from other Palaces because is at the edge and in top of a hill but it is an nice one .",
          "When visiting the Place du Palais, it is worth waiting to observe the changing of the guard at mid-day.",
          "A real must plus very cheap to go inside such a rich and interesting palace. It was a joy. Look.out for the mirrored corridor was really funny.",
          "We both loved it. Good audio guide and whilst being informative it also keeps you moving. About 1 hour to do the whole palace and it is a good pace. Well worth the \u20ac8 euro. You can get combined tickets covering car museum and oceanography centre for only a few euro more.",
          "Worth the hike! You can do some people watching and of course very nice view from the top. However, i do not have a chance to go in.",
          "The palace is very beautiful with lots of furniture, paintings, etc in it. The audio guides are great and easy to use. Just choose your language when you get there. This palace brings you back in time. Very impressive!! We bought our ticket combined with a ticket to the Jacques",
          "The palace is extremely rich and beautiful. The audio guide is very useful. There is a room where Grace Kelly's wedding took place. But, it is not allowed to take photos inside. Changing of guards is very interesting. In terms of beauty this palace can be compared to royal",
          "Wonderful on top there great views over Monaco you must go get the bus the bus is good it takes you all over its so clean up there full history",
          "If you visit the Prince's Palace make sure you time your arrival around noon as the daily changing of the guard happens right at noon. Lots of pomp and pageantry & the price is right. It's free. Come early if you want a good vantage point as it does get busy during the summer",
          "Of course if you're passing through Monaco, you should stop at the Palace. We found a paid parking garage and brought along a picnic lunch. We walked up the hill (which was reasonable) and enjoyed the views the whole way! Once at the top, the view of the harbor is incredible.",
          "Allow up to 2 hours for visiting this beautiful palace. The ticket office is behind you as you look at the palace and there are various combination tickets available (e.g. combine with the Oceanagraphic Museum). If travelling together, one person stand in the queue whilst the",
          "Even if you don't go inside, it is worth a visit for its history, the dramatic view and many excellent photo opportunities: old cannons, view of harbor below. You can take the Little Train or walk up. The Palace is situated atop a cliff called the Rock. The area of Monaco has",
          "We were visiting Monte Carlo for the day so had to visit the palace. This was a really well maintained and informative tour, with audio guides explaining what you say in each room. It did not however go into the history as much as it could. This was a fortified palace for a long",
          "I've been to many palace and castles but the decor in this one was more modern and nice. The pictures of Princess Grace with her family were cool to see. No pictures allowed. Quick walk through.",
          "We visited the palace whilst on a day trip from our cruise, we walked from the aquarium up passed the park and cathedral to the princes place . The changing if the guard happens daily just before 12 noon, but get there earlier as the crowds gather in advance to watch this",
          "I entered on crutches with prepaid ticket and was faced with lots of stairs. No lift. Struggled up one level which caused a lot of pain and asked for a chair to sit on but they said none available. I was then given the option to leave and sit in garden. I asked for a cup of",
          "Easy to reach. Few steps from the city. Nearby church and can have a wonderful view of montecarlo. A statue of Francois Grimaldi just outside the palace . Interesting story behind it.",
          "Good tour of an impressive palace with a good audio guide. Don't forget to turn yoyur phones off though and no photos allowed. Reasonably priced worth a visit.",
          "Get there early.....very popular with tourists and locals. We hopped of the Hop On Hop Off tour bus to see this event and also to have lunch in one of the many restaurants closely. Don't miss it!",
          "This was a decent stop, but nothing too special. We did not pay to go inside, just took pictures from the square and explored a little bit in the neighborhoods across the square from the palace. Good 1-2 hour stop.",
          "Very nice place and a real must to be/see in Monaco. Not only it was worth watching the change of guards but it was so nice to visit the Palace. Before you enter make sure you swiched your camera/phone off, since taking ppictures inside is strictly forbbiden. The entrance is",
          "Really amazing palace that is still the Prince's residence (and for this reason the tour is a little short - the can't show you everything!). Beautifully maintained in styles of Monaco's history, and the audio guide is extremely informative, and included in the ticket price. It",
          "I really expected more than what was there, it was a simple tour with about 11 stations of information. Kind of sad really for a tour. Obviously a great looking place, but it's not why I came here. I had better experiences at the aquarium, and the church. Little historical",
          "This Palace is worth visiting - the Changing of the Guard at Noon is precision to watch but if you want to see the marchers fee, be there very early as very crowded even for May. As the area available in the Palace for public view is not large, it doesn't take that long to go",
          "Not too often do we get a chance to experience the changing of the guards these days. The quick ceremony is free and more intimate than Buckingham Palace. Make sure you arrive around 11:30 to position yourself to watch closeup. A quick and interesting experience. You get",
          "To be fair, we didn't go inside. From the description in combination of the ticket price, we didn't think it was worth it. But, we stuck around for the changing of the guard. It was great! Very professional and interesting. I loved the drummers and the trumpet player. You need",
          "After travelling along from Juan les Pins on the train, we spent a lovely day in Monaco and visited the Palais du Prince. You have three choices of tickets, we would have liked to have done the Palace and car collection but as it was around 4pm when we turned up there wouldn't",
          "It worth going to the Prince's Palace... it has a stunning view of Monaco and Monte Carlo. Take a walk around there and you'll love the buildings. We took a walk from the Casino Monte Carlo until the Palace and it's very close. I recommend!",
          "Free audio guide upon entry, gives explanation and history of Monaco and each room and its decorations. Security needs to check your bags and belongings. The line up for entry is a bit mixed up (individual and group - signs are unclear). You can purchase the ticket as a set with",
          "Visited as part of the passport to Monte Carlo scheme, this gives vouchers to many different attractions. The rooms are beautiful and well maintained. The audio guide was very oil and well timed. Would recommend to all visitors",
          "The changing of the guards (at 11:55am) is worthwhile if you're in the area at the time - but don't make a special effort. The whole fortress on the hill is really amazing and worth the steps - it's not that hard to walk up. The palace is a short 45 minute visit with an",
          "This is the official residence of the Prince of Monaco. Originally this was built to be a fortress. It dates back to 1191. It is protected by palace guards. It is a lovely building except for the part to the right that looks like it was added as an afterthought and in no way,",
          "monaco was our second port of call on our recent HAL cruise. although we had been here several times before, it was still an eye opening experience to see the massive yachts in the harbour, to visit princess grace's grave in the church and to see the changing of the palace guard",
          "What a beautiful building. Not expensive to view and all very interesting. You are given a headset to walk around with and that gives the important detail. Much smaller than I was expecting but still well worth a trip. Got there using the bus which you can get from outside the",
          "Went to Monaco to visit the pink Palace where Princess Grace and Prince Rainer lived. It was in a lovely setting with a nice little street off from the sq where you can eat and shop. You can have an audio guide which was very good and interesting as you go through the different",

          "Once in South of France, this is a must see. A trip to monaco palace and monaco. Beautiful views. We drove up. It closes @ 6.00pm so it's quieter late afternoon. You can see the wealth in Monaco. It's all over the place. Will definitely go back again.",
          "I took the guided tour of the palace, which was beautiful and well maintained and very interesting. At the entrance to the palace you are provided with a headset and machine which takes you on a one hour long guided tour of the palace. At the end of the tour I handed in my",

          "Best time to see at Midday, during guard change. Nice to see the ceremony, you can take some pictures. Not far from there, the oceanograpich museum worth visit (14 euros, 7 for kids). A wonderful view for pictures from up there to see whole Monaco and french Riviera.",
          "the walk to the entrance of the palace was great and the palace was over all an impressive architecture, but its the nature view around which is more lovely. It needs to explored if you are in Monaco!",
          "After a fairly steep climb you are rewarded with a view of Royal guards and a bustling square with beautiful views. The palace is extremely well preserved. My favourite room is the Blue Room, which is used for state receptions. The colours and opulence are breathtaking. We spent",
          "The Prince's Palace is on the top of the rock (Le Rocher) based on the original fortification and still where the royalty of Monaco live. It is quite a steep walk or a quick taxi ride to the top where you will see what might be imagined as a palace exterior from a fairy tale",

          "Very nice area and the view is gorgeous. A little bit expensive to buy suveenirs but definitely worths visiting.",
          "Monaco is one of my favourite places in Europe. It is a small principality and is full of so much character and heritage! Whenever we visit the France we go and spend a day there. The Prince's Palace is a beautiful place to see and walk around. The views from around the palace",
          "Great experience. A bit of a hike up to the palace but well worth it. We arrived just in time for the changing of the guard. Fabulous views from the top of the cliff. Explore the little side streets. We came across some lovely little cafes and restaurants. Took a long walk down",
          "We visited the Royal Palace on a combination ticket with the Oceanographic Museum, which offered good value (saving 3 euro). There are no photographs allowed in the Palace, although you can take pictures of the changing of the guard outside. We followed the audio tour through",
          "Beautiful Frescos, precious furniture, sculptures, china and impressive rooms full of art are waiting for a visit. The entrance fee can be combined with other museums to get a discount and is totally worth it. Good audio guide is for free in multiple languages. Visit the palace",

          "Very beautiful and interesting. With the audio guide, it was great to learn more about the palace and royal family's history. Better than other palaces in that this is still in use, although the Prince doesn't reside there, he lives just down the road by the aquarium. Changing",
          "You have to climb a slight hill to get up here but wow is the view worth it! We watched the changing of the guards, didnt go into the palace. Watched the vintage grand prix, payed in the playground and walked around the gardens behind and below. Beautiful spot. Nicest thing we",

          "We took the Number 2 bus up here when we came out of the railway station. We didn't see the changing of the guard so can't comment on that. It is a lovely palace and there is an abundance of restaurants up the side streets opposite.",
          "It's quite a walk up to the palace from the marina...be prepared to be seriously out of breath, especially if the weather is hot! It's well worth it though as the building is beautiful and there are some seriously stunning views to be seen.",
          "It is for the wealthy but they allow us to visit. We arrived by ship and I must say the port is amazing seen from the water. Also, so many huge yachts. We did enjoy walking the city and sensing how some people live. The Palace was lovely. Changing in the guard happens at 11:55",
          "Visited here on way to Monte Carlo. Great views from terraces nearby, and the guards uniforms must be seen. Best way is to park and walk to see this, as well as the rest of the old village. Pleasantly of shops and cafes around.",
          "Its worth the hike to see this palace. It is small compared to other palaces around Europe but dont expect huge things in Monaco. The view from the hill is breathtaking. Change of guards on the other hand is quite boring.",
          "Nothing to grand about this palace, but it still is a pretty unique experience. You can watch the guard march back in forth in front and enjoy a caf\u00e9 at a nearby shoppe. I'm conflicted on whether it was worth the long hike up, but the charming little side streets at the top made",
          "Have you been in palaces in france? If you have and expect the same you will be dissapointed. Not quite as the Versailles. Okay, the Princess might still live here. Still, the place is very small with just under 20 rooms opened to the crowds. Remember to buy ticket before",
          "One other place that you should visit for sure. You can reach it by foot, starting from the port.Do not miss it.",
          "The square is cool and some nice old cannons are on display, but the changing of the guards is not that spectacular and it's hard to see with all the Euro-tourists pushing past you. This isn't worth waiting for if you can get a cappuccino or something else to take a picture of",
          "The place has a rich history with an ancient architecture. the place is very clean and the view of the sea side is magnificent.",
          "Although we didnt enter in the Palace, the main square is great for sightseeing and amazing photographs. It is on the top of a hill, but is a very nice walk with beautiful views over the city :) Furthermore is on the way to see the exotic garden and the occeanographic museum.",
          "You do not get to see so many rooms but what you do see is worth the visit at only e8 wig audio guide. The paintings of the family were lovely to see especially those of Princess Grace. The rooms are in the usual French opulant style so much gilt and carvings. Tip get the bus",
          "All intentions of visiting the Palace. Could see it from down below... Finding it however was more trickier than I thought. After eventually finding this magnificent building I was in awe!

          "From whatever I saw on land perspective, this was the highlight of my trip. Go on a sunny day, walk towards the Palace through Exotic Garden and then from Palace see fantastic views of Monaco and its port.",
          "We arrived and at the palace and it was quite breath taking. I must say seeing this palace especially from the cliff side when you see it from behind is probably more breath taking than Buckingham Palace. From the main side of the place we could literally look over Monte Carlo",
          "We visited the palace and did the tour where you take a speaker that tells you about the history and rooms in the Palace. No photos can be taken in the building whilst on the tour and you will need to pack away your camera. Despite this, it is a tour that was very good to",
          "I didn't know you could visit some of the Palace rooms as I only usually watch the changing of the guard so it was a nice surprise to be able to get tickets and have a look around. We got headphones with a commentary in English for each room with descriptions and details about",

          "What's the point in visiting Monaco if you don't view the palace close up. History buffs will love it. Culture buffs will love it and Americans should visit the former home of Princess Grace. It's stately but not overtly so and the architecture and views are very beautiful. I am",

          "The views of Monaco are absolutely gorgeous from this spot. My family and I toured the wing of the Prince's Palace open to the public. The self-guided audio commentary was informative and insightful. Everything we saw, the rooms, the furniture and the artwork were remarkable.",
          "We enjoyed just seeing the palace, it is very beautiful. We were not able to get inside as we understood, it is only open to the public during the month or April. If you are in Monaco during that month I would think it would be well worth the time to take a tour.",
          "This was the number 1 place I wanted to visit in Monaco, unfortunately when I came it was closed. There was very little information available to say when they would open again other that \"February 2016\", well given that it was February when I attended then this was of no use!",

          "Changing of the Guard takes place promptly at 11:55. However, about 10 minutes prior there was a small ceremony between the two guards at the entrance. Do not mistake this for the \"actual\" changing of the guards as some people did and they left prior to the main ceremony at",
          "If you want a good view of Monaco you must come here. The best way to get there would be to catch the Nice-Monaco-Menton 100 bus from the Nice port and hopping off at the Place d'Armes stop. From there it's a 15 minute medium incline walk to the top. Up there it looks pretty",
          "We went before Christmas day and the place was crowded. I think it's also because we were there before noon, before the changing of the guards. The Palace was really a great place to look at Monte Carlo below. A great Vantage point indeed. Walking up and down the hill was a",

          "I climbed up to see the Palace on an overcast, and rainy day, however this did wonders for clearing away a lot of the crowd. I managed to get up right to the front row with no troubles, and got some ideal photos of the changing of the guard at 11:55, not as glitzy and glamorous",
          "Even though we visited in mid-December, this attraction was over-run with loads of tourists, both from the cruise ship in the harbour and from buses from Italy. Worth timing your visit to the changing of the guard (a low-key, brief ceremony), if you can see through the crowds.",
          "Beautiful Palace on top of the hill overlooking all of Monaco. Make sure you get there for 11 for the changing of the guards. Wear good walking shoes, it is quite expansive with the gardens and the paths back into the city.",
          "Its a very short tour and there is really nothing much to see. The whole of Monaco revolves around the Aura of Princess Grace Kelly. After seeing Versailles and Palaces in Austria this one is a big disappointment. Full tour is done in less than 1/2 hour. Not worth the Price.",
          "A nice ceremony outside the palace. Low key compared to similar European ceremonies but worth catching when in the area. A relaxed and friendly ceremony where you can stand next to the action. Good photo opportunity which gives a good clue to the pace of life.",
          "OK so there are only a few rooms open to the public compared to the size of the Palace, but it's important to remember it is still lived in. The little there is to see is to be fair, well presented. Inevitably, plenty of information with photos and paintings still prominent",
          "The whole tour takes just under an hour to visit 11 rooms. There's not much to see to be honest. The throne room and the Russian Tsar letters were the highlights. No photos allowed.",

        "wiki": "Grace Patricia Kelly (November 12, 1929 \u2013 September 14, 1982) was an American film actress who, after starring in several significant films in the early to mid-1950s, became Princess of Monaco by marrying Prince Rainier III in April 1956.\nAfter embarking on an acting career in 1950 when she was 20, Kelly appeared in New York City theatrical productions and more than 40 episodes of live drama productions broadcast during the early 1950s Golden Age of Television. From 1952 to 1956 she starred in several critically and commercially successful films, usually opposite male romantic leads 25 to 30 years older than her. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in director John Ford's African-filmed adventure-romance Mogambo, starring Clark Gable and Ava Gardner, which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1954 she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her deglamorized performance in the drama The Country Girl with Bing Crosby. Other noteworthy films in which she starred include the western High Noon (1952), with Gary Cooper; the romance-comedy musical High Society (1956), with Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra; and three Alfred Hitchcock suspense thrillers in rapid succession: Dial M for Murder (1954), with Ray Milland; Rear Window (1954), with James Stewart; and To Catch a Thief (1955), with Cary Grant.\nKelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. It is well known that Hitchcock was hoping she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement. Kelly and Rainier had three children: Princess Caroline, Prince Albert, and Princess St\u00e9phanie. Kelly retained her link to America by her dual U.S. and Mon\u00e9gasque citizenship. Princess Grace died at Monaco Hospital on September 14, 1982, succumbing to injuries sustained in a car crash the previous day. At the time of her death, she was 52.\nShe is listed 13th among the American Film Institute's 25 Greatest Female Stars of Classical Hollywood Cinema.\n\n\n== Background and early life ==\n\nGrace Patricia Kelly was born on November 12, 1929, at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to an affluent and influential family. Her father, Irish-American John B. Kelly Sr., had won three Olympic gold medals for sculling and owned a successful brickwork contracting company that was well known on the East Coast. As Democratic nominee in the 1935 election for Mayor of Philadelphia, he lost by the closest margin in the city's history. In later years he served on the Fairmount Park Commission and, during World War II, was appointed by President Roosevelt as National Director of Physical Fitness. His brother Walter C. Kelly was a vaudeville star, who also made films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures, and another named George was a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning dramatist, screenwriter, and director.Kelly's mother, Margaret Katherine Majer, had German parents. Margaret had taught physical education at the University of Pennsylvania and had been the first woman to coach women's athletics at Penn. She also modeled for a time in her youth. After marrying John B. Kelly in 1924, Margaret focused on being a housewife until all her children were of school age, following which she began actively participating in various civic organizations.Kelly had two older siblings, Margaret and John Jr., and a younger sister, Elizabeth. The children were raised in the Catholic faith.Kelly grew up in a small, close-knit Catholic community. Saint Bridget's was the East Falls parish where she was baptized and received her earliest education. Founded in 1853 by Saint John Neumann, the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint Bridget's was at that time a relatively young parish, where families were very close to one another. While attending Ravenhill Academy, a reputable Catholic girls' school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters. In 1942, at the age of 12, she played the lead in Don't Feed the Animals, a play produced by the East Falls Old Academy Players. Before graduating in May 1947 from Stevens School, a socially prominent private institution in nearby Chestnut Hill, she acted and danced. Her graduation yearbook listed her favorite actress as Ingrid Bergman and her favorite actor as Joseph Cotten. Written in the \"Stevens' Prophecy\" section was: \"Miss Grace P. Kelly \u2013 a famous star of stage and screen\". Owing to her low mathematics scores, Kelly was rejected by Bennington College in July 1947.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nDespite her parents' initial disapproval, Kelly decided to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress. John was particularly displeased with her decision; he viewed acting as \"a slim cut above streetwalker\". To start her career, she auditioned for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, using a scene from her uncle George Kelly's The Torch-Bearers (1923). Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admissions officer, Emile Diestel, and was admitted through the influence of George.Kelly worked diligently, and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, and she made her Broadway debut in Strindberg's The Father, alongside Raymond Massey. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story.Television producer Delbert Mann cast Kelly as Bethel Merriday in an adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel of the same name; this was her first of nearly sixty live television programs. As a theater personality, she was mentioned in Theatre World magazine as: \"[a] most promising personality of the Broadway stage of 1950.\" Some of her well-known works as a theater actress were: The Father, The Rockingham Tea Set, The Apple Tree, The Mirror of Delusion, Episode (for Somerset Maugham's tele-serial), among others.Success on television eventually brought her a role in a major motion picture. Impressed by her work in The Father, the director of the Twentieth Century-Fox film Fourteen Hours (1951), Henry Hathaway, offered her a small role in the film. Kelly had a minor role, opposite Paul Douglas, Richard Basehart, and Barbara Bel Geddes, as a young woman contemplating divorce. Kelly's co-artist Paul Douglas commented of her acting in this film: \"In two senses, she did not have a bad side\u2013 you could film her from any angle, and she was one of the most un-temperamental cooperative people in the business.\" Following the release of this film, the \"Grace Kelly Fan Club\" was established. It became popular all over the United States, with local chapters springing up and attracting many members. Kelly referred to her fan club as \"terrifically amusing\".Kelly was noticed during a visit to the set of Fourteen Hours by Gary Cooper, who subsequently starred with her in High Noon (1952). He was charmed by her, and said that she was \"different from all these sexballs we've been seeing so much of\". However, Kelly's performance in Fourteen Hours was not noticed by critics, and did not lead to her receiving other film acting roles. She continued her work in the theater and on television, although she lacked \"vocal horsepower\", and would likely not have had a lengthy stage career.\n\nKelly was performing in Colorado's Elitch Gardens when producer Stanley Kramer offered her a role co-starring opposite Gary Cooper in Fred Zinnemann's High Noon, a Western set in an historic old mining town in Columbia, California. She accepted the role, and the film was shot in the late summer/early fall of 1951 over a 28-day shooting schedule in hot weather conditions. She was cast as a \"young Quaker bride to Gary Cooper's stoic Marshall\", and she wore a \"suitably demure vaguely Victorian dress\", alongside Gary Cooper, who was 28 years her senior. The movie was released in the summer of 1952. High Noon garnered four Academy Awards, and has since been ranked among the best films of all time. However, High Noon was not the film that made Kelly a movie star, despite it now being one of her best-known films. As biographer H. Haughland states: \"Miss Kelly's acting did not excite the critics, or live up to her own expectations.\" Some critics scoffed at the conclusion of the film in which Cooper's character has to be saved by Kelly. David Bishop argues that her pacifist character, killing a man who is about to shoot her husband, was cold and abstract. Alfred Hitchcock described her performance as \"rather mousy\", and stated that it lacked animation. He said that it was only in her later films that she \"really blossomed\" and showed her true star quality.Grace Kelly's uncle George Kelly, a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning playwright, advised and mentored Kelly during her Hollywood film career. Her film career lasted from September 1951 to March 1956.\n\n\n=== Acting career at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ===\nAfter filming High Noon, Kelly returned to New York City and took private acting lessons, keen to be taken seriously as an actress. She performed in a few dramas in the theater, and in TV serials. She appeared in several television plays, and screen-tested for the film Taxi in the spring of 1952. Director John Ford noticed Kelly in a 1950 screen test, and his studio flew her out to Los Angeles to audition in September 1952. Ford said that Kelly showed \"breeding, quality, and class\". She was given the role, along with a seven-year contract at the relatively low salary of $850 a week. Kelly signed the deal under two conditions: first, that one out of every two years, she had time off to work in the theatre; and second, that she be able to live in New York City at her residence in Manhattan House, at 200 E. 66th Street, now a landmark.\n\nTwo months later, in November 1952, Kelly and the cast arrived in Nairobi to begin the production of the film Mogambo. Gene Tierney initially was cast in the role, but she had to drop out at the last minute due to personal issues. Kelly later told Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, \"Mogambo had three things that interested me: John Ford, Clark Gable, and a trip to Africa, with expenses paid. If Mogambo had been made in Arizona, I wouldn't have done it.\" Kelly plays Linda Nordley, a contemplative English wife with a romantic interest in Clark Gable. The costumes, designed by Helen Rose, were \"safari style\". Over the three-month shoot, no feminine looking outfits were used. A break in the filming schedule afforded her and Mogambo co-star Ava Gardner a visit to Rome. The film was released in 1953, and had a successful run at the box office. Kelly was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.After the success of Mogambo, Kelly starred in the TV play The Way of an Eagle with Jean-Pierre Aumont, before being cast in the film adaptation of Frederick Knott's Broadway hit Dial M for Murder, opposite Ray Milland and Robert Cummings. In this film, Kelly plays the role of the wealthy wife of a retired professional tennis player. Director Alfred Hitchcock, who had also seen the 1950 screen test, would become one of Kelly's last mentors. She was loaned by her studio MGM (with whom she had signed a seven-year contract in order to do Mogambo), to work on several Hitchcock films, later appearing in Rear Window and To Catch a Thief.Kelly began filming scenes for her next film, The Bridges at Toko-Ri, in early 1954, with William Holden, for Paramount Pictures. The story, based on the novel by James Michener, is about American Navy jet fighters stationed to fight in Asia. Kelly plays the role of Holden's wife. Her dress designer was Edith Head, with whom she had established a friendly relationship. The upper-class outfits received a mixed reception from critics; one critic said that \"Kelly's flavoring was just plain vanilla\".\n\nKelly unhesitatingly turned down the opportunity to star alongside Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront (1954). Eva Marie Saint, who replaced her, won an Academy Award for that role. Instead, she committed to the role of Lisa Fremont in Rear Window. Said Kelly, \"All through the making of Dial M for Murder, he (Hitchcock) sat and talked to me about Rear Window all the time, even before we had discussed my being in it.\"\n\nKelly's new co-star, James Stewart, was highly enthusiastic about working with her. The role of Lisa Fremont, a wealthy Manhattan socialite and model \u2013 a fashion model who \"never wore the same dress twice\"  \u2013 was unlike any of the previous women she had played. For the first time, she was playing an independent career woman. Just as he had done earlier, Hitchcock provided the camera with a slow-sequenced silhouette of Kelly, along with a close-up of the two stars kissing, finally lingering closely on her profile. Hitchcock brought her elegance to the foreground by changing her dresses many times, including: \"glamorous evening short dresses, a sheer negligee over a sleek nightgown, a full-skirted floral dress, and a casual pair of jeans\". On the film's opening in October 1954, Kelly was again praised. Variety's film critic remarked on the casting, commenting on the \"earthy quality to the relationship between Stewart and Miss Kelly\", as \"both do a fine job of the picture's acting demands\".Kelly played the role of Bing Crosby's long-suffering wife, Georgie Elgin, in The Country Girl, after a pregnant Jennifer Jones bowed out. Already familiar with the play, Kelly was highly interested in the part. To do it, MGM would have to lend Kelly to Paramount. Kelly was adamant, and threatened the studio, saying that if they did not allow her to do the film, she would pack her bags and leave for New York for good. MGM relented, and the part was hers. Kelly also negotiated a more lucrative contract in light of her recent success. In the film, Kelly plays the wife of a washed-up, alcoholic singer, played by Crosby. Her character becomes torn emotionally between her two lovers, played by Bing Crosby and William Holden. She was again dressed by Edith Head to suit her role in the film. She was initially dressed in fashionable dresses, but this wardrobe changed to ordinary-looking cardigans and \"house dresses\" toward the end of the film.As a result of her performance in The Country Girl, Kelly was nominated for and ultimately won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her main competitor was Judy Garland for her performance in A Star Is Born. After receiving the Oscar nomination, Kelly won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best actress for her performances in her three big movie roles of 1954: Rear Window, Dial M For Murder, and The Country Girl. At the Golden Globe Awards in 1955, Garland and Kelly both won awards for their respective performances. Garland won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical, and Kelly won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\nWith every film, Kelly received greater acclaim. The New York Times praised her performance in The Country Girl as \"excellent\", and Rear Window got her marquee credits on a par with, and beyond, those of James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock.In April 1954, Kelly flew to Colombia for a 10-day shoot on her next project, Green Fire, with Stewart Granger. She played Catherine Knowland, a coffee plantation owner. Granger wrote in his autobiography of his distaste for the film's script, while Kelly later confided to Hedda Hopper, \"It wasn't pleasant. We worked at a pathetic village \u2013 miserable huts and dirty. Part of the crew got shipwrecked ... It was awful.\"\n\nAfter the consecutive filming of Rear Window, Toko-Ri, Country Girl, and Green Fire, Kelly flew to the French Riviera to begin work on her third, and last, film for Alfred Hitchcock, To Catch a Thief. Lent by MGM to Paramount Films for the fifth time, Kelly plays the role of a temptress who wears \"luxurious and alluring clothes\", while Cary Grant plays the role of a former cat thief now looking to catch a \"thief who is imitating him\". Kelly and Grant developed a mutual admiration. The two cherished their time together for the rest of their lives. Years later, when asked to name his all-time favorite actress, Grant replied without hesitation: \"Well, with all due respect to dear Ingrid Bergman, I much preferred Grace. She had serenity.\"In 1956, Kelly portrayed Princess Alexandra in the British film The Swan, directed by Charles Vidor, opposite Alec Guinness and Louis Jourdan. Her final role was in Charles Walters's musical film High Society, a re-make of the 1940 MGM classic The Philadelphia Story. In this film, she stars opposite Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Celeste Holm.\n\n\n== Princess of Monaco ==\nKelly headed the U.S. delegation at the Cannes Film Festival in April 1955. While there, she was invited to participate in a photo session with Prince Rainier III, the sovereign of the Principality of Monaco, at the Prince's Palace, about 55 kilometers away from Cannes. After a series of delays and complications, she met him at the Prince's Palace of Monaco on May 6, 1955. At the time of her initial meeting with him, she was dating the French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont.\n\nAfter a year-long courtship described as containing \"a good deal of rational appraisal on both sides\", Prince Rainier married Kelly in 1956. The Napoleonic Code of Monaco and the laws of the Catholic Church necessitated two ceremonies \u2013 both a civil ceremony and a religious wedding. The 16-minute civil ceremony took place in the Palace Throne Room of Monaco on April 18, 1956, and a reception later in the day was attended by 3,000 Mon\u00e9gasque citizens. To cap the ceremony, the 142 official titles that she acquired in the union (counterparts of her husband's) were formally recited. The following day the church ceremony took place at Monaco's Saint Nicholas Cathedral, before Bishop Gilles Barthe. The wedding was estimated to have been watched by over 30 million viewers on live television and was described by biographer Robert Lacey as \"the first modern event to generate media overkill\". Her wedding dress, designed by MGM's Academy Award-winning Helen Rose, was worked on for six weeks by three dozen seamstresses. The bridesmaids' gowns were designed by Joe Allen Hong at Neiman Marcus. The 700 guests included several famous people, including Aristotle Onassis, Cary Grant, David Niven and his wife Hj\u00f6rdis, Gloria Swanson, Ava Gardner, Aga Khan III, Gloria Guinness, and many others. Frank Sinatra was invited but did not attend. Kelly and Rainier left that night for their seven-week Mediterranean honeymoon cruise on his yacht, Deo Juvante II.The couple had three children:\n\nPrincess Caroline, born January 23, 1957\nPrince Albert, born March 14, 1958, current Prince of Monaco\nPrincess St\u00e9phanie, born February 1, 1965\n\n\n== Later years ==\n\nHitchcock offered Princess Grace the lead in his film Marnie in 1962. She was eager, but public outcry in Monaco against her involvement in a film where she would play a kleptomaniac made her reconsider and ultimately reject the project. Director Herbert Ross tried to interest her in a part in his film The Turning Point (1977), but Rainier quashed the idea. Later that year, she returned to the arts in a series of poetry readings on stage and narration of the documentary The Children of Theater Street. She also narrated ABC's made-for-television film The Poppy Is Also a Flower (1966).\nGrace and Rainier worked together in a 33-minute independent film called Rearranged in 1979, which received interest from ABC TV executives in 1982 after premiering in Monaco, on the condition that it be extended to an hour. Before more scenes could be shot, Grace died and the film was never released or shown publicly again.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn September 13, 1982, Kelly was driving back to Monaco from her country home in Roc Agel when she had a stroke. As a result, she lost control of her 1971 Rover P6 3500 and drove off the steep, winding road and down the 120 foot (37 m) mountainside. Her daughter St\u00e9phanie, who was in the passenger seat, tried but failed to regain control of the car. Kelly was taken to the Monaco Hospital (later named the Princess Grace Hospital Centre) with injuries to the brain and thorax and a fractured femur.  She died the following night at 10:55 p.m. after Rainier decided to turn off her life support.St\u00e9phanie suffered a light concussion and a hairline fracture of a cervical vertebra, and was unable to attend her mother's funeral.\n\nKelly's funeral was held at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate in Monaco-Ville,  on September 18, 1982. After a Requiem Mass, she was buried in the Grimaldi family vault. Over 400 people attended, including Cary Grant, Nancy Reagan, Danielle Mitterrand, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Empress Farah of Iran.\nRainier, who did not remarry, was buried alongside her in 2005.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Filmography ===\n\nSelected Filmography (Feature Films)\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\n\n=== Discography ===\n\"True Love\", a duet with Bing Crosby from High Society (1956)\nL'Oiseau du Nord et L'Oiseau du Soleil, in French and in English (1978)\nBirds, Beasts & Flowers: A Programme of Poetry, Prose and Music (1980)\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Acting ===\nKelly left a lasting legacy as a model, theater artist, television actress (her most prolific work, acting in around 100 TV plays), and an iconic Hollywood film star. Kelly has been cited as one of the \"classic Hitchcock blondes\", and as one of the most elegant women in cinematic and world history. One author describes her as the \"elegant glamour girl of the screen\".Grace Kelly appeared on the cover of the 31 January 1955 issue of the weekly magazine Time. The magazine hailed her as the top movie star who brought about \"a startling change from the run of smoky film sirens and bumptious cuties\". She was described as the \"Girl in White Gloves\" because she wore \"prim and noticeable white gloves\", and journalists often called her the \"lady\" or \"Miss Kelly\" for this reason as well. In 1954, she appeared on the Best Dressed list, and in 1955, the Custom Tailored Guild of America listed her as the \"Best-Tailored Woman\".In appreciation of her work with Hitchcock in three of his films, Kelly later wrote a foreword to the book The Art of Alfred Hitchcock by Donald Spoto. Spoto also had written High Society: The Life of Grace Kelly.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nDuring her marriage, Kelly was unable to continue her acting career. Instead, she performed her daily duties as princess and became involved in philanthropic work.She founded AMADE Mondiale, a Monaco-based non-profit organization that was eventually recognized by the UN as a Non-governmental organization. According to UNESCO's website, AMADE promotes and protects the \"moral and physical integrity\" and \"spiritual well-being of children throughout the world, without distinction of race, nationality or religion and in a spirit of complete political independence.\" Her daughter, Princess Caroline, carries the torch for AMADE today in her role as President.\nKelly was also active in improving the arts institutions of Monaco, forming the Princess Grace Foundation in 1964 to support local artisans. In 1983, following her death, Princess Caroline assumed the duties of President of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation; Prince Albert is Vice-President.Following Kelly's death, the Princess Grace Foundation-USA (PGF-USA) was established to continue the work she had done anonymously during her lifetime, assisting emerging theater, dance and film artists in America. Incorporated in 1982, PGF-USA is headquartered in New York and is a tax-exempt, not-for-profit, publicly supported organization. The Princess Grace Awards, a program of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, has awarded nearly 800 artists at more than 100 institutions in the U.S. with more than $15 million to date. The foundation also says it \"holds the exclusive rights and facilitates the licensing of her name and likeness throughout the world.\"In 1965, Princess Grace accepted with pleasure the invitation to be an honorary member of  La Leche League (a worldwide mother to mother support group that focuses on mothering through breastfeeding) and in 1971 was a speaker at their conference in Chicago, addressing 1400 mothers, 800 fathers and 800 babies. Princess Grace was a known advocate of breastfeeding, and successfully fed her 3 children.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nWhile pregnant with her daughter Caroline in 1956, Kelly was frequently photographed clutching a distinctive leather handbag manufactured by Herm\u00e8s. The purse, or Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches, was likely a shield to prevent her pregnant abdomen from being exposed to the prying eyes of the paparazzi. The photographs, however, popularized the purse and became so closely associated with the fashion icon that it would thereafter be known as the Kelly bag.Kelly was inaugurated into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1960.Numerous exhibitions have been held of Kelly's life and clothing. The Philadelphia Museum of Art presented her wedding dress in a 2006 exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of her marriage, and a retrospective of her wardrobe was held at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 2010. The V&A exhibition continued in Australia at the Bendigo Art Gallery in 2012. This famous dress, seen around the world, took thirty five tailors six weeks to complete. An exhibition of her life as Princess of Monaco was held at the Ekaterina Cultural Foundation in Moscow in 2008 in conjunction with Monaco's Grimaldi Forum. In 2009, a plaque was placed on the \"Rodeo Drive Walk of Style\" in recognition of her contributions to style and fashion.After her death, Kelly's legacy as a fashion icon lived on. Modern designers, such as Tommy Hilfiger and Zac Posen, have cited her as a fashion inspiration. During her lifetime, she was known for introducing the \"fresh faced\" look, one that involved bright skin and natural beauty with little makeup. Her fashion legacy was even commemorated at the Victoria and Albert Museum of London, where an exhibit titled, \"Grace Kelly: Style Icon\" paid tribute to her impact on the world of fashion. The exhibit included 50 of her legendary ensembles. She is remembered for her \"college-girl\" everyday fashion, defined by her pulled-together yet simple look.In 2016, Forbes included her on the list 10 Fashion Icons and the Trends They Made Famous.\n\n\n=== Kelly's likeness ===\n\nIn 1955, Kelly was photographed by Howell Conant in Jamaica. He photographed her without makeup in a naturalistic setting, a departure from the traditional portrayal of actresses. The resulting photographs were published in Collier's, with a celebrated photo of her rising from the water with wet hair making the cover. Following her marriage, Conant was the unofficial photographer to the House of Grimaldi and extensively photographed her, Rainier, and their three children. In 1992, Conant published Grace, a book of photographs that he took during her 26-year tenure as Princess of Monaco.Kelly has been depicted by many pop artists including Andy Warhol and James Gill. Warhol made a portrait of her for the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia as a limited edition silkscreen in 1984.\n\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n\nA rose garden in Monaco's Fontvieille district is dedicated to the memory of Kelly. It was opened in 1984 by Rainier. She is commemorated in a statue by Kees Verkade in the garden, which features 4,000 roses.In 2003, the Henley Royal Regatta renamed the Women's Quadruple Sculls the \"Princess Grace Challenge Cup.\" The Henley Stewards invited her to present the prizes at the 1981 regatta, expiating the ill will from her father's falling foul of its amateurism rules in 1920. Prince Albert presented the prizes at the 2004 regatta.\n\n\n=== Kelly family home ===\nIn 2012, Kelly's childhood home was made a Pennsylvania historic landmark, and a historical marker was placed on the site. The home, located at 3901 Henry Avenue in the East Falls section of Philadelphia, was built by her father John B. Kelly Sr. in 1929. Grace lived in the home until 1950, and Prince Rainier III proposed to her there in 1955. The Kelly family sold the property in 1974.Prince Albert of Monaco purchased the property, speculating that the home would be used either as museum space or as offices for the Princess Grace Foundation.\n\n\n== Awards and Nominations ==\nOther Honors\n\nStar on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1960)\nAmerican Film Institute's 13th Top Female Stars of American Cinema (1999)\n\n\n== Titles, Styles, Honors and Arms ==\nUpon her marriage to Prince Rainier III in 1956, as the consort of the reigning sovereign prince of Monaco, she was styled \"'Her Serene Highness The Princess of Monaco\" until her death in 1982. Today she is alternatively remembered by her maiden name \"Grace Kelly\". \n\n\n=== National honors ===\n Monaco: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint-Charles\n\n\n=== Foreign honors ===\n Austria: Recipient of the Red Cross Medal\n Belgium: Recipient of the Red Cross Medal\n France: Recipient of the Red Cross Medal\n Greek Royal Family: Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Beneficence\n Iranian Imperial Family: Recipient of the Commemorative Medal of the 2,500 year Celebration of the Persian Empire\n Italy: Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Solidarity\n  Vatican: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre\n Sovereign Military Order of Malta: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Merit, Special Class\n Nicaragua: Grand Cross of the Order of Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo\n Spain: Recipient of the Red Cross Plaque of Honor and Merit\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Coins and stamps ===\nIn 1993, Kelly appeared on a U.S. postage stamp, released in conjunction with a Monaco postage stamp featuring her image on the same day.\nTo commemorate the 25th anniversary of Kelly's death, \u20ac2 commemorative coins were issued on July 1, 2007 with the \"national\" side bearing the image of her.\n\n\n=== Films ===\nIn 1983, an American television film called Grace Kelly focused on Kelly's early life was presented featuring Cheryl Ladd as Kelly and Ian McShane as Rainier.\nNicole Kidman portrayed Kelly in Grace of Monaco (2014), directed by Olivier Dahan. Reaction to the film was largely negative; many people, including the princely family of Monaco, felt it was overly dramatic, had historical errors, and lacked depth.\nIn season 6, episode 20 of Once Upon a Time, Emma Swan wears a wedding dress that is highly similar to Grace Kelly's.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nKelly is mentioned in the lyrics of \"Vogue\" by Madonna (1990).\nKelly's name is mentioned in the lyrics and title of \"Grace Kelly\" by MIKA (2007).\nKelly was also honored in the Piebald anthem, \u201cGrace Kelly With Wings.\u201d\nKelly is mentioned as Princess Grace in Billy Joel's \"We Didn't Start the Fire\".\nKelly is mentioned in Grace Kelly Blues by the band, eels.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nIn the video game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, operator Grace \"Dokkaebi\" Nam is said to be named after Grace Kelly.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nHaugland, H.

          "Princess Grace liked roses & flowers in general & the thought of a memorial garden is a nice idea. But the size & scope of the idea could be improved. All Monaco features suffer from over kill & tourism. The statue is worthy of discussions",

          "I don't know how to rate this, but just wanted to inform people that this place is closed except during summer. I was here in March and it was under rennovations, the closest you will get to it is Le Meridian beach plaza.",
          "I was fortunate to have a warm and sunny day to spent some time on Larvotto beach. The water was a little cold already still ok though. During the summer they set a net to protect swimmers from jelly fish which is cool. The beach's nice, not crowded and has plenty of easy going",
          "There is a huge construction work at the beach of Monaco. Therefore the entire beach is closed because it is involved in the construction. It is difficult to imagine where can many people have their coffee, where people can have a walk or do their jogging sessions and what can",
          "Free beach at Monte Carlo ,good sand,near few restoraunts and clean sea. I was first time at Monaco and I liked this place ,sunny and quit beach .",
          "Loved this beach.Water was delightful for swimming! Wanted more time there... This was part a visit to Italy & we took a 3 hour train ride from Milan to Monaco. The trio to this beach was a definite highlight!",
          "I have been there for a short visit but I feel that I have to stay there for ever, due to the Beach looks like attracting you to stay and just watch.That was really excellent scene, still I remember and is preserved in my mind.",
          "I really enjoyed this beach while in Monaco. The water was clear and clean, the beach wasn't super busy (even in the middle of a Saturday in July), and the sandstone that made up the beach was relaxing to lay on. Definitely recommend this beach for a fun + cheap day activity.",
          "Great beach with beautiful waters to take a dip in! Highly recommend this area of the shore in Monaco!",
          "One of the best parts of the French Riviera. Nice beach with great view. The beach is made of stone sand.",
          "It's a great place if you love to be up close and personnal with lots of people, the main desappointment was the \"sand\" wich was actually just cobbles.",
          "Very nice and calm beach. Buildings arounds the shore looks really beautiful. Restaurant looks quite decent.",
          "Enjoying the Med? Dreaming of cool crystal blue water....NOT HERE. Your are in the middle of a gigantic construction site, an extention of the Principality at sea, which will lats at least until the end of 2025!! Water is poluted, so are the disgracefully dated ammenities.",
          "Not quite as glamorous as you might expect from Monaco, but still well worth a visit. I had a lovely day here. I'd recommend going here once, but go to the Marquet beach or Plage Mala for something more special. The pool in the centre of town is also fab!",
          "We have spent almost all mornings here. Our sons have driver their bicycles or were playing with the pebbles next to the sea. Meanwhile I was drinking a capuccino with my wife. Everything was perfect: the view, the air, the atmosphere. On the other hand unfortunatly the end",
          "Want to do the Riviera thing, we'll stroll a few hundred meters from your hotel to this very Mediterranean beach. If you are used to sandy beaches of the Caribbean you might be disappointed that it's all tiny pebbles here. But it's a nice beach and people watching is good as",
          "Excellent beach, great statues and privacy. One wzrrer feature could do with a clean, bit rusty...and dogs drink from it and go in it",
          "great place for a swim ,just 5 mins. from the Fairmont hairpin really cheap compared with Casino Square beer \u00a35 great pizza about \u00a310",
          "This small typical man-made beach lacks charm and you have giant cruise boats on the horizon instead of infinity. I guess if you are in Monaco it's the only beach in town, but there are such nicer sand beach with natural coves and protected views along the cote d'azur. I would",
          "Swimming in the Mediterranean ocean at Larvotto beach is so beautiful & clean & what a view looking out at the multi million dollar boats & the cruise ships. There are plenty showers along the beach. Bring your floatie to relax in the ocean or bring your goggles n snorkel if",
          "After a hot day walking around Monte Carlo it was great to have a swim here. The water was clean and warm, there were very clean and free toilets nearby. There is no sand, just pebbles, it's quite nice and clean. You can swim out to a pontoon, admire boats coming and going.",
          "Very Nice place to see, was there 2018 of May, there was many roads closed because of Grand Prix, but our trip was perfect",
          "I\u2019m glad to be back in Monaco ... I came back after 16 years all still the same...... Is a quiet beach, very clean, Tidy. Take a swim in there is like be in a swimming pool You can play sone sports like beach volleyball, there are some stores to buy drinks and of course some",
          "The beach was so clean and tidy and there is a net in the water to protect the beach. We liked being on the beach due to its many small stones, we did not have to be on sand. There were plenty of good caf\u00e9s and shops along the beach. The view from the shore was really stunning",
          "How can you not go to the beach? especially in Monte Carlo - drive along the water and find your way, and when it seems like you need a private invite, find your way there - it's lovely!",
          "Monte Carlo was quiet nothing special was not going on end of september beginning October. Weather was wonderful people was sunbathing even I. Water was nice and warm. Beautiful. Like always meditterean areas. Cafes was open. Place which were busy all the time was cafe de paris.",
          "This was a lovely beach. Really pretty, with lovely, gentle rolling waves on the shoreline. A really peaceful spot to sit and enjoy the sunshine or grab a drink in one of the nearby bars.",
          "Took a stroll along the beautiful beach. A few brave people in the water, which I would say is normal for November. I am quite sure that the place is packed in the summer time due to the prime location in Monaco. Could be that you have nicer beaches elsewhere, but here you are",
          "The facilities are great, there are kiosks and wash rooms at the beach. The beach by itself isn't great, it's good if you are in the city and don't have time to drive out 15min to a much better beach.",
          "Simple beach in Monaco. If you have time more better visit to beaches outside Monaco . If you havnt time - better spend day for more unique place",
          "There are 3 or 4 public beaches and 4 or 5 private beaches. Each private beach has a restaurant and their own long chairs. If you want to spend the day in a private beach you have to reserve the places in advance if you want to be next to the water and pay an average of 35 euros",
          "One of the few public beaches in Monte Carlo and it shows. The day we went it was blazing hot and rammed with people. The \"sand\" is small shingle so no sandcastles for the kids! Guess there are lifeguards but did not see any. They are dredging nearby so the views are spoilt by",
          "It's a small and very crowded (during season) beach with surface of stones and unclear blue water. Was good for fast refreshment during hot day in city, there is also a shower to wash up after.",
          "Like all of Monaco area, the beach is very busy, but worth a visit even if it is only to see the world pass by!",
          "Crowded and noisy place with no much facilities, the two cafes offering transats are providing service \"\u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\" ignoring customers ((. Definitely to avoid during high season...",
          "This is Public beach with all what you need from clean wide nice beach , free Toilets and Shower indoor, many choices of restaurants and Gelaterias, Playgrounds and Kids palying area. Easy to reach by Bus. Plenty of tourists are there.",
          "Worth a visit just to sit back and relax for an hour or two. Word to the wise, bring your own water\\ snacks \u20ac2.50 for 25cl of water is excessive and preys on the captive audience. No sand, lovely pebbly\\gravel beach - wear flip flops or trainers if walking.",
          "The beach situation of late is that the machinery doing work on the Monte-Carlo extension is stirring sand and slime into the water, which inevitably find their way on what should be the best beach on the Mediterranean. You end up bathing into a mud mixture, which if it were not",
          "Very busy beach with toilets and Bars and restaurants even a gym the sand looks like man made ! lots of children playing and having fun,",
          "Lovely beach and perfect for a swim. Great little shops around for ice cream and drinks, although remember to take sun lotion as this is very expensive at this beach. Plenty of space on the beach to get a spot for the family.",
          "The beach at Larvatto is generally crowded but that's with reason- there are toilet facilities, bus stops nearby and lots of bars, etc if you feel thirsty or peckish. It struck me as really cool what a mix of people were there- people with bodies and bikinis straight from",
          "Monaco is a beautiful city, very safe, beautiful ice super cars, every step you meet people from the front pages of newspapers",
          "A very nice spot for a swim with lots of beach facilities for an enjoyable stay. There are also a great choice of restaurants and bars along the beachfront Promenade.",
          "Nice beach, but could have been a bit more clean. Not too crowded early in the season, and easy accessible by bus.",
          "10 of us spent about 3 hours at this beach. \u20ac35 per person. I certainly think it was worth it. Fairmont hotel booked this for us. The staff were very helpful, they were always looking to make our time at the beach comfortable. I recommend it.",
          "It was relaxing on the beach even though there was plenty of people about. I think it was the fact that the beach is well catered for so you didn't have to go far for anything, lots of restaurants on the corniche, close proximity to the car park & toilets. There are showers on",
          "We went in December when it was about 20 Celsius outside, so no to swimming, but if you love beach walks and fish spotting here is the place to do it. It is small with pebbles. You can take bus no. 5 to reach it. Right across the street you can see many showrooms for supercars!",
          "We had a wander down here and a look at the flash car show rooms and the Japanese gardens along with the football walk of fame before reaching the beach. Beach small and packed but a walk out on the concrete walkway was good to see the lovely fish in the clear water. Lots of",
          "As the Fairmont Hotel pool had no available beds we had to go to the beach, expecting something rather plush given we are in Monte Carlo to say we were disappointed is an understaement! I can liken this beach to a childhood memory of Benidorm in 1972 it I'm sure it's a meeting",
          "It's an small beach but beautiful place. Clear water and without waves. And water temperature not so cold. I really recommend this fabulous beach \u263a",
          "Spent lots of time walking and enjoying people and dog watching. A few restaurants and shops to purchase beach toys, umbrellas, and ice cream.",
          "Larvotto Beach is very crowded pebble beach but it does have crystal clear blue water. It is a great place if you love to be up close and personal with lots of people.",
          "Lavrotto Beach is the public Beach in Monaco and for me it\u2018s simply to crowded especially at the high season.",
          "This has been one of the nicest and less crowded beaches I have been to on the Mediterranean! It's a small little beach with tiny pebbles, it beats the rocky beaches in nice and Menton! They are tiny enough to lay comfortably on the beach and walk without shoes. It's very well",
          "Beautiful blue water beach in Monaco; very close to the Casino and a perfect destination for beach lovers. The weather is mostly nice and sunny. The water was bit cold but it was nice sunny to go in the sea and soak in the sun. It wasn't that crowded in April. There aren't much",
          "Local public beach with private restaurants. Fun and full of surprises. Not stuffy. Parking and bus available.",
          "We took a boat trip to Monaco from Nice for a day's visit. We did a lot of walking and sightseeing and when we walked past the beach it looked too good to resist. We ended up spending a couple of hours here and having a swim (in our underwear lol). A nice beach and would like",
          "This is a very good beach.Where the bus terminal is.The beach is a good place to spend time and enjoy the water.",
          "What a great beach, this was actually a quieter beach than I was expecting. Take your time and relax her for a day.",
          "Full of private beaches but enjoyed the public site very much. Sun bath and swimming was nice. There walked many policemen so felt safe. Nice beach showers too!",
          "I used to visit this beach every weekend when I lived there. It is exceptional, clean and clear waters, warm white sand and stunning views. The only thing that I would say is beware of jellyfish even though they have nets to avoid them.",
          "This is the only place where I have seen a hand rail leading down into the sea so that those who are a little unsteady can get to the sea. Monaco has the highest life expectancy in the world (90), so someone has thought it through for elderly bathers.",
          "It's a nice sight, and at 19 deg in November very attractive, but it consists of fine pebbles rather than sand.",
          "We took a cruise that stopped in Cannes, France and then took a tour that went to Nice, Monaco and Monte Carlo. We stopped in Monte Carlo which is the second smallest country on the planet and took a look at the beach, casino, palace and all of the people having fun in the sun!",
          "I loved this man made beach, I thought it was very clean and tidy, it is small, but it's so lovely and picturesque. We stayed here for most of the day and I thoroughly enjoyed relaxing, people & yacht watching, swimming, eating and drinking on the beech front.. Its well worth",
          "This is a very relaxing beach, ideal to chill out, take a swim and enjoy the day ahead.Not too crowded when we went.",
          "Perfect place to spend sunny hot day in Monaco. It is free for public but we went also to private part cos I needed a big umbrella and a table. Water was very warm but not so clean. It was very crowded when we were there , maybe that's why. U can do some water sport as well.",
          "The water was nice and fresh. Blue as it gets and the rocks are nice and smooth. It was a cold day but I got a little dip :) Go if you can",
          "Monaco does not have great sandy beaches, however Larvotto has a smooth (ish) beach with some activities and the location is great.",
          "I regrettably swam there with the kids, water is dirty and polluted with oil. You can get her Easley from the port by public buss. C U AROUND",
          "The beach is a shingle beach will many restaurants and bars nearby. There are showers on the beach which is useful and the shingle was extremely dusty. The sea was clear and warm with a few fish near to shore. You could swim out to a diving platform just off the beach and",
          "Like most beaches on the Riviera this is not very nice, is small and crowded. I think that is the only beach in Monaco.",
          "This beach is worth a stop in this beautiful city. The small rocks are much more comfortable than the beaches in Nice. It was not crowded as we were there in the fall. Very clean.",
          "this is the perfect place to grab some sun and have a wind down day. its small, quiet, feels safe and the water is so clean (as is most of the French Riviera). a must for some down time !",
          "I love this pebble beach and the the protected waters of larvotto. The past there were plagues of meduse ( jelly fish ) & in the last few years larvotto has placed jelly fish nets and a regular sea cleaner. Safe to swim ! You can actually feed the fish by hand with old French",
          "As you may expect from French waiters, they were doing things their way so customer requests were not a priority, so much so we regretted asking for beach front tables as this seemed to make them more determined not to give us one. It attracts a crowd due to the location, and",
          "Larvotto Beach is the main beach in Monaco and is open to the public for free. It is clean and is man made from pea gravel which is a bit of a surprise to those who are used to sandy beaches. I recommend bringing your own umbrella, towels, and cushions (pea gravel is a bit",
          "We were there August 15th, 2016. First of all, we were looking for a sand beach on the Riviera. Not really there. Nice's beach is stone and Monte Carlo's is pebbles. Having said that, there's something to be said for a pebble beach. It's not at all bad on the feet and at the end",
          "The beach was fitted with many small stores and restaurants and it also had several showers. The main disappointment was the 'sand' which was actually just cobbles which under the sun would get so hot that walking barefoot on them afterwards would feel much like an extreme",
          "The beach has a proteced section with a large net to avoid any bad surprises Clean - ok, parking sometimes a challenge...",
          "I was expecting it to be sand. And from far it looks that way. It is nice. It is the only one. It is full of people. And great atmosfere.",
          "Here you will get ' les girls' of every age - slim teenagers from local homes with the shape which housewives slumbering in New Jersey must dream of: early in the morning you may spot the mistresses of local Russians toning their bodies in the tepid sea water: ageing beauties",
          "Monaco's only beach is very clean and offers a great view. There's no sand but very small pebbles that feel good on your feet!",
          "Water was perfect for swimming and even snorkelling, super clear water with lots of fish! It wasn't too crowded either which was refreshing as opposed to some other beaches in the south of France.",
          "There aren't many nice sandy beaches here, but the clear water makes up for the small stones that pretend to be a real beach. With the weather hot and humid, the sea here is a great relief....",
          "Supernice public beach in middle of Monaco/Monte Carlo. next to several private beaches with (overpriced) restaurants. Free toilets and good parking possibilities (underground parking house)",
          "I really am a pool person, but my family dragged me here. Against my better judgement it was actually quite pleasant. The beach is smooth gravel - much better than sand... The sea is nice and clear - and a net about 100 yds out reassuringly banishes all the creepy crawlies from",
          "The beach has no sand but small stones. The water is clear and clean. Shops in the area. No nice view.",
          "After a long day admiring the sights go to the beach and have a swim in the crystal clear water so refreshing . There are bars and cafes along the beach . Hire a deck chair or just lie on the beach",
          "We went in early June the week after madness of formula 1 and it was very calm and empty and just a lovely beach. The water is so clear and you can see lots of fishes and maybe a jellyfish or two, it finished off a really nice day in Monaco.",
          "its a clean beach with quite clean waters. Very less crowded so lot more fun. There a few cafes around the beach. You can easily chill with your friends for 2-3 hrs here. Very very relaxing place.",
          "This is a pebble beach the sea is clear and stunning and there is plenty of fish around when you stand on the pontoon . There is a range of good restaurants where you can have lunch or dinner and hire deckchairs and spend the day by the beach with great service .",
          "Supposedly, the barrier keeps the jelly fish and other trash away from the beach. They do indeed. However, the shore is always dirty from the people trampling in the eroding stones, making the water turquoise (an indication of dirt) rather than crystal clear. The accommodations",
          "a tipycal beach which one would find at a busy city. It consists of small pebbles and i found the water to be very clear. When i visited in May the water temperature was too cold for me but its good enough to bring to towel or rent a bed and enjoy the spring sunshine.",
          "This is really the best beach I have ever known. So much organised n well maintained. Really very clean. Views here are superb. All the facilities you can get here. Nice beach restos n gym here. Special beach for kids. Extra ordinary beach. Great.",
          "This beach is perfect in spring time and Autumn. A nightmare in the summer. It's not that large a beach and it's not that comfortable either. But it's very nice to take a dip in the warm waters and relax during the day. It's clean and well looked after. Felt very safe. Didn't",
          "Larvotto Beach is a good choice in Monte carlo. A very warm and clean water where i enjoyed swimming. The restaurant and price here also very nice!",
          "It is a lovely place. If you love swimming in warn sea. Quite good time until October. The sand is not the best beach sand, but this is what you have here.",
          "Great beach. Lovely to swim from. Warm sea, even in October when we went. Obviously, the private areas were not closed to public as late in the season. Gritty sand is hard to walk on, but typical for med.",
          "Lovely location, lovely surroundings, lovely sea; clean, well cared for, surrounded by cafes and restaurants. Just slip off those Guci Flip Flops and step onto Paradic..... Ouch! Jeepers! Help! The Beach? Scratch that! The area between the walkway and the sea has been",
          "The beach area is tidy and clean with a couple of reasonably priced restaurants. It was quiet when we visited. I do think for a place like Monte Carlo - they could import some proper sand rather than the fine shingle currently there",
          "If you are expecting soft sandy beach area, perfect clear water with a stunning natural backdrop you are in the wrong area, it is not happening here. Unfortunately, the beach is composed of small pebbles, and any sand that might exist was trucked in. The back drop is not one of",
          "clean sand and water. lots of fish. Various beach club areas with sunbeds to rent . several cafes/ restaurants. toilets.",
          "Montecarlo is a beautiful place, very luxury. If you are staying in a hotel next to the Larvoto Beach, its fine, but if you have to travel there (no matter by car or bus) it dosen't really worth it as there are lots of great beaches around the area. To a hong konger, this is",
          "his small beach is super clean. The water is calm and has a barrier just before the open sea. Every evening the beach side is cleaned. Showers are available. They have a special cleaning instrument to collect all the floating debris.",
          "Very small area, maybe one city block total. This is not a beach for a nice stroll. This beach is only for swimming. Restaurants line the small beach, some have chair rental. We rented chairs and had lunch. The water was cooler than I expected, so I didn't swim. No sand on this",
          "If you are looking for a beach in Monaco that is not overpriced, with option of seating and sand, this is a nice place to go.. i spent the afternoon here and it was better than Nice",
          "The beach is very long and accommodates the large crowds well. The water is beautiful and usually calm. More sunbathing than swimming going on though.",
          "As the money real beach in Monte Carlo it does get busy, but that is part of the attraction. Good showers all over the place and very clean public toilets. Great for families. Make sure you bring an umbrella/parasol as it is expensive to hire one. I prefer the small little",
          "Larvotto is a big and new beach.Better than Le Club 55. Some of th epeople in the Casino go there and a lot of topless ladies. Not so good for family with children.I love the Monte Carlo Beach club for privacy.",
          "The only beach in Monte Carlo, it is crowded. Definitely a place to \"see and be seen\". Everyone gathers here to play and sunbathe. The beach is nice but gets crowded on hot summer days. Like most European beaches, it is bikini-top optional, so don't get caught staring at naked",
          "Clear water, clean, public and private beach, so you can hire sun beds if you want to. Clean toilets nearby. Plenty of places to eat and drink not over priced.",
          "I dont know if popular is the word but it is one of the few public beach in Monaco... so not too much people.",
          "Happily spent 2 to 3 hours ea h morning on this beach where it was quiet enough to swim and for our 5year old to learn to snorkel with the fish. Small stones rather than sand. Yes it gets busy but all beaches on the med do! Sea was jelly fish free which was good as there can be",
          "A very average beach. Although we liked there were stones instead of sand, the water was green and it was very overcrowded.",
          "This is the public beach in Monaco. Not near the casino or other Monaco attractions but more in a residential area. Summer weekends it is sardine-packed with daytrippers from Italy, etc. You can pay to have a sunbed and some drink service at one of the little \"clubs\" but it",
          "It is the best place to see the Mediterranean sea. Windy place.Good for sunbath. It's better too take a open tourist bus to see this place. It is very easy to go from Nice Airport. Taxi, Buses and Trains are available till midnight",
          "This is really a pretty beach set in a beautiful city. Monaco is extremely worth seeing. The gardens are lovely and the beach is great. We spent a morning there and had a good time.",
          "I liked this beach , after a long day of walking around Monaco we relaxed at the beach and had a nice swim. We were lucky as after 5 Beach was not busy and in the part we choose to swim was pretty quite. Just dissapoitment as a young woman who travelled with 7year old also -",
          "Try going down early at 9am to this beach & you may spot some of the elegant local ladies toning their immaculate bodies with some assisted swimming ( assisted by a coach or by flippers ) - they can be identified by wearing dark glasses whist swimming plus a large floppy hat to",
          "A small but really nice beach, we were there just before high season and it was not that busy. Close to restaurants and shops.",
          "Larvotto Beach is crowded and its perfect for a short visit. I came here without a swimming suit so I end up contemplating around.",
          "Larvotto beach was good for swimming compared to some of the other much rockier beaches in Europe, it was finer pebbles so made it much easier to walk on, water was good not polluted, there were water sports available near by and plenty of places around to get lunch or an ice",
          "A beach in the middle of a town ! Public beach, volley ball, a gym , restaurants ,shopsand very clean facilities. all beaches should be like Larvotto. Clean and completely safe. Bravo Monaco",
          "The area could do with some improvement when you stay at the Montecarlo bay which is stunning and then come here there is some sort of disappointment as the place could do with a whole revamp , saying that the place does the job and there are some good restaurants to go to on",

          "The beach is fine, nothing amazing but very cool considering where it is. We stayed at the Neptune beach club - great service and prices, though the food was only so-so. The water was spectacularly clean. One day here was a jellyfish invasion, but I was able to swim without",

          "As I have already mentioned in an earlier review on the Le Neptune Plage Restaurant, this is a great place to spend a hot day- food, drink lazing away and of course the sea! If you don't take one of the hundreds of lounges, don't worry about sand in you swim suit- Larvotto has",

        "wiki": "Fontvieille (French pronunciation: \u200b[f\u0254\u0303vj\u025bj]) is the southernmost ward in the Principality of Monaco. It was developed by an Italian architect, Manfredi Nicoletti, between the 1970s and the 1990s.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn contrast to the other city districts Monaco-Ville, Monte Carlo and La Condamine, Fontvieille was constructed, after Italian engineer Gianfranco Gilardini's design, almost entirely on artificially reclaimed land and thus represents one of the younger parts of the principality. In order to combat the chronic land shortage in the extremely densely populated principality, the work was begun in 1966 to create new land in the Mediterranean Sea southwest of le rocher. In 1981, the then Crown Prince Albert (since April 6, 2005 Albert II, Prince of Monaco) laid the cornerstone for the new city quarter.The existence of Fontvieille, and its many public works projects, relates substantially to former Prince of Monaco, Prince Rainier III's reputation as the Builder Prince.\nPlans announced in late 2009 to extend Fontvieille by the Department of Urban Development are currently being overseen by Prince Albert. The plan is to build a small 0.05 km\u00b2 (0.02 sq mi) or 5.3 ha (13 acres) aura on the west side of the rock, currently planned to be finished by 2015.The new area will include 3 to 4 new hotels, corporate businesses, shops and apartments for between 600-800 newcomers.\nDespite not being the highest-priced part of Monaco, flats are also very expensive. For example, 65 m\u00b2 (700 ft\u00b2) 1 bedroom apartment with 1 bathroom and 1 car parking space, was offered at \u20ac3,200,000 (about $3,514,000 US) in May 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFontvieille represents the southwestern portion of the city-state, which is an area of 0.33 km2 (0.13 sq mi) or 33 ha (82 acres). It accommodates 3,602.4 hectares (9.9 acres) of Fontvieille are given over to the Fontvieille Park and Princess Grace Rose Garden.\n\n\n== Stade Louis II ==\nFontvieille contains Stade Louis II (or Louis II Stadium), which serves as the home ground of AS Monaco FC, a Monaco football club that is one of the most successful in the French national league.\nAlso host a small indoor sports arena called Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin where AS Monaco Basket what plays in LNB Pro A. It also host other evens like Handball, Volleyball, Gymnastics and more.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nThe district also contains the Monaco Heliport, which provides frequent links to Nice Airport in neighboring France, with connections to direct flights to New York, Dubai, London, and other important European destinations.\nMonaco's automobile museum, the Monaco Top Cars Collection, is located on the Terrasses de Fontvieille.The Museum of Stamps and Coins contains a display of Monegasque money dating to 1640, which illustrates the postal history of the principality.\nColumbus Hotel Monaco, which was owned by former racing driver David Coulthard, is located in Fontvieille.\nVenturi and its subsidiary Voxan are headquartered on the northern side of Fontvieille.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMunicipality of Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fontvieille at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFontvieille, Monaco",

          "Whilst luxury boats bob around on the blue Mediterranean waters and the sweet smell of wealth bellows from around the corner in Monaco, Fontvielle is sadly lacking in the glamour from its neighbour. I personally feel that the buildings reaching towards the waters edge are ugly",
          "We didn\u2019t actually go down to the port. We appreciated the views of it from upon high. The views were amazing and looked so upscale. I think unless you have a boat or yacht would it actually be beneficial to go down there.",
          "Away from the big harbour round he Corner, Fontvielle is super impressive when viewed from the old town across to the mountains. A cute harbour, with much smaller vessels than the town harbour, well worth seeing from above.",

          "Strolled here from the cruise dock as it's the only part of Monaco we'd not previously visited and really enjoyed the peace and quiet compared with the main harbour. There are stunning views of the old town. From the harbour we took the coastal path to Cap d'Ail in a westerly",
          "We stumbled across this area after seeing it from when we visited the old town. It is a very quiet area, with a nice marina and spectacular cliffs up to the old town. There are a few bars and restaurants, a great area is you want some peaceful time.",

          "Dramatically situated beneath the Princes Palace on the cliff that is Monaco Ville, Fontvielle is a charming oasis after the noisy chaotic building site which is modern Monaco. There are around a dozen fairly unpretentious and reasonably priced (particularly at lunchtime) local",
          "I like this place since it's less tourists over here, and not so crowded as in the main port. Good choice of restaurants for lunch, and cafeteria for cup of espresso. Sometimes there are antique market, where you can buy some interesting elements for your home design.",

          "Port de Fontvieille is a place where wealth and privilege are on display in dramatic fashion. Unlike the situation at Monte Carlo Harbor, where the harbor looks like it belongs to a city, Port de Fontvieille looks like a little world of its own. It is a self-consciously",
          "The port is an excellent spot to stay whilst in Monaco. It contains many of the major attractions and quite a few large boats to stare at! The area is relatively new as it is land reclaimed from the sea in Monaco's bid to expand. It has a good range of restaurants and a delight",
          "A super clean and safe place to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the sight of expensive cars, yatchs and apartments .Out at sea there are pretty sailboats like butterflies floating and dancing with melodious harmony. Up in the air there are civil helicopters flying high net worth",
          "The port de Fontvieille is one of the Monaco parts which were artificially after land gain over water built. Hat having said, it is very flat and easy to walk, with lots of restaurants on the marina side , be it English, French or Italian. Being there you should walk to the",
          "Beautiful port high cliff walls which are lit at nightfall, stunning backdrop to the magnificent yachts moored, bars and restaurants line on side.",
          "This place would be awesome just about anywhere else in the world....the problem is that Monaco is just over La Roche. There are multimillion dollar yachts, good restaurants, beautiful blue water and it is within rowing distance of the Mediterranean. If you have several days in",
          "Best viewed from above, up by the Palace. The waters are crystal clear and range from light to deep blue. Lots of high end yachts and condos on the shore. Excellent photo op.",
          "Lovely port some nice restaurants and shops but a bit lacking overall. Thought there would be more eating places etc around the port but felt safe walking around at night.",
          "Smaller than monte Carlo harbor, but algo a great place to see. More calm, but with great view and boats too",
          "Not an attraction in it's own right as such, the Port is a nice place to take a stroll and view all of the luxury yachts (and quite often the luxury cars too parked up alongside!) You get a great view of the sea, the Palace of Monaco on the rock above and the yachts coming and",
          "Here you have great views, lots of restaurants, lots of beautiful boats to look at and nice walks all around.",
          "It is the best place to see the Mediterranean sea. Windy place. Good to have a cruise. Monaco Ville is very near to this place. It's better too take a open tourist bus to see this place. It is very easy to go from Nice Airport. Taxi, Buses and Trains are available till midnight",
          "There are several harbours & marinas in Monaco. Port de Fontvieille is very pretty. It is dominated by very steep high cliffs which drop straight into the beautiful clear water. It's full of really gorgeous boats, especially now during g F1 weekend. Most of the cruise ship",
          "Inspiring views, relaxing atmosphere, the best boats in the world, just enjoy life, sit back relax, sun is shining 365 days in Monaco ;-)",
          "If you are hoping to sail into the main harbour at Monaco, then this is where to catch a boat from, small cafe bars adorn the edges of the harbour, but it is from here that all the small boat tenders leave during race weekend, to take you to the yacht for race viewing and an",
          "We spent a lot of time in this area of Monaco. It was a very nice walk from our hotel. It seems like it is a public port because there are meters for the many yachts docked there. There is a luxury hotel and upscale, luxury high rise condominiums. It is a very, very nice",
          "A beautiful little port with an awesome view. Although it is surrounded by bars and restaurants, it is still very tranquil and relaxing. The port staff were very attentive and helpfull every time we called them. Surrounded by all amenities; an amazing supermarket within a 5",
          "A wonderful little harbour with turquoise water.A lot of yachts.Very close from here you can find the zoo,Museum of Stamps and Coins, and a shopping center-Terrasses de Fontvieille.",

        "wiki": "La Condamine is the central Ward in the Principality of Monaco. Its landmarks include Port Hercules, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium, and the Princess Antoinette Park. Its farmer's market at the Place d'Armes dates from 1880 and is a great source of local pride for its \"authentic Monegasque\" essence.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Monegasque constitution of 1911 created three communes: La Condamine was then one of the three communes of the Principality. It is there that Fernand Forest died in 1914. A single commune was re-established in 1918.\n\n\n=== Legends ===\nSaint Devote was martyred in Corsica in the 3rd century. According to tradition, the boat that was to carry her body to the African land, was caught in the storm, a dove then guided her to the European shore and landed in Monaco. In the Middle Ages, the relics of the saint were stolen and taken away by boat. But when the criminals were caught, their boat was burned. This is the origin of the ceremony which is celebrated on January 26 of each year and during which a boat is burnt on the square in front of the votive church. The next day an imposing procession takes place.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe district occupies a small valley which was crossed by the railway viaduct (today the railway passes through a tunnel) which has become a road linking the district and Monte Carlo.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nCondamine dates from the Middle Ages, and means cultivable land. It is the second oldest area of Monaco, after Monaco-Ville. Its location between Monaco-Ville and Monte Carlo has made it like the best of both worlds, where, in the early 20th century travel writers recommended its hotels, \"much cheaper than those at Monte Carlo\" and as close to the \"old city\" (Monaco-Ville) as a tourist could stay, because Monaco-Ville has no hotels. The late 19th century official princely archivist Gustave Saige described it as the culmination of the \"small semicircular\" Port Hercule, \"inclined amphitheatrically towards it.\"\n\n\n== Education ==\n\u00c9cole de la Condamine\n\u00c9cole des R\u00e9voires\nInternational School of Monaco\nRegency School of Languages\nLyc\u00e9e Technique et H\u00f4telier (hotel and technical school)\nAcad\u00e9mie Rainier III Musique et Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMunicipality of Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Fontvieille (French pronunciation: \u200b[f\u0254\u0303vj\u025bj]) is the southernmost ward in the Principality of Monaco. It was developed by an Italian architect, Manfredi Nicoletti, between the 1970s and the 1990s.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn contrast to the other city districts Monaco-Ville, Monte Carlo and La Condamine, Fontvieille was constructed, after Italian engineer Gianfranco Gilardini's design, almost entirely on artificially reclaimed land and thus represents one of the younger parts of the principality. In order to combat the chronic land shortage in the extremely densely populated principality, the work was begun in 1966 to create new land in the Mediterranean Sea southwest of le rocher. In 1981, the then Crown Prince Albert (since April 6, 2005 Albert II, Prince of Monaco) laid the cornerstone for the new city quarter.The existence of Fontvieille, and its many public works projects, relates substantially to former Prince of Monaco, Prince Rainier III's reputation as the Builder Prince.\nPlans announced in late 2009 to extend Fontvieille by the Department of Urban Development are currently being overseen by Prince Albert. The plan is to build a small 0.05 km\u00b2 (0.02 sq mi) or 5.3 ha (13 acres) aura on the west side of the rock, currently planned to be finished by 2015.The new area will include 3 to 4 new hotels, corporate businesses, shops and apartments for between 600-800 newcomers.\nDespite not being the highest-priced part of Monaco, flats are also very expensive. For example, 65 m\u00b2 (700 ft\u00b2) 1 bedroom apartment with 1 bathroom and 1 car parking space, was offered at \u20ac3,200,000 (about $3,514,000 US) in May 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFontvieille represents the southwestern portion of the city-state, which is an area of 0.33 km2 (0.13 sq mi) or 33 ha (82 acres). It accommodates 3,602.4 hectares (9.9 acres) of Fontvieille are given over to the Fontvieille Park and Princess Grace Rose Garden.\n\n\n== Stade Louis II ==\nFontvieille contains Stade Louis II (or Louis II Stadium), which serves as the home ground of AS Monaco FC, a Monaco football club that is one of the most successful in the French national league.\nAlso host a small indoor sports arena called Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin where AS Monaco Basket what plays in LNB Pro A. It also host other evens like Handball, Volleyball, Gymnastics and more.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nThe district also contains the Monaco Heliport, which provides frequent links to Nice Airport in neighboring France, with connections to direct flights to New York, Dubai, London, and other important European destinations.\nMonaco's automobile museum, the Monaco Top Cars Collection, is located on the Terrasses de Fontvieille.The Museum of Stamps and Coins contains a display of Monegasque money dating to 1640, which illustrates the postal history of the principality.\nColumbus Hotel Monaco, which was owned by former racing driver David Coulthard, is located in Fontvieille.\nVenturi and its subsidiary Voxan are headquartered on the northern side of Fontvieille.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMunicipality of Monaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fontvieille at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFontvieille, Monaco",

        "wiki": "The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the official residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and besieged by many foreign powers. Since the end of the 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family who first captured it in 1297. The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with their larger and stronger neighbours.\nThus while other European sovereigns were building luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics and common sense demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco one of the most unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.\nThe Grimaldis' occupation of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, the absence of alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted in their use of the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected in the evolution of the palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became symbols of the slightly risqu\u00e9 glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became a chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.\n\n\n== Princely Palace ==\n\nThe palace is a blend of architectural styles; its ancient origins are indicated by a lack of symmetry. Thus to evaluate the architecture, wings and blocks have to be observed separately. The principal fa\u00e7ade appears as a terrace of Renaissance style palazzi from differing periods of the Renaissance era (Illustrations 1 and 12) which\u2014even though they form only one palace\u2014is exactly what they are. These wings are however united by their common rusticated ground floor. This Renaissance architecture seems to mask earlier fortifications, the towers of which rise behind the differing classical fa\u00e7ades. These towers\u2014many complete with crenellations and machicolations\u2014were actually mostly rebuilt during the 19th century. At the rear of the palace the original medieval fortifications seem untouched by time. (Illustration 4). A greater architectural harmony has been achieved within the court of honour around which the palace is built, where two tiers of frescoed open arcades serve as both a ceremonial balcony for the prince's appearances and a state entrance and corridor linking the formal state rooms of the palace.\n\nThe most notable of the many rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were enhanced in the style of those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.Other rooms in the state suite include the Red Room \u2014 so called because its walls are covered in red brocade \u2014 a large drawing room containing paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.\nThe most remarkable room in the suite is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room is lined with Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.\nWhile the overriding atmosphere of the interior and exterior of the palace is of the 18th century, the palace itself is not. Much of its appearance is a result of a long evolution dating from the 12th century, overshadowed by heavy restoration and refurnishing during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\n== Grimaldi fortress ==\n\nMonaco's history predates the Roman occupation of AD 122. Its large natural harbour ensured a steady stream of visitors from Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon. Later the Phoenicians came to trade silk, oil, and spices with the natives. It was the Phoenicians who introduced to this area of the Mediterranean their god Melkart, later known by the Romans as Hercules Monoikos. It was after this god that the Romans renamed the area Portus Hercules Moneici, which has evolved to the present name of Monaco.\nThe seat of the Prince of Monaco was established on the Rocher de Monaco (Illustration 5) as a fortress in 1191 when the harbour, that is today lined by Monte Carlo, was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. The harbour and its immediate area were given to the Genoese by the Emperor Henry IV with the proviso that the Genoese protect the coastline from piracy. Further territory was ceded to the new owners by the Council of Peille and the Abbaye de Saint Pons. In 1215 work began on a new fortress, comprising four towers connected by ramparts protected by a curtain wall. This forms the core of the present palace.\nGenoa was important in the politics of 12th-century Europe. The Genoese were a nation of merchants, and such was their wealth that they frequently fulfilled a role as bankers to the other nation states. However, the Genoese became divided following the rift caused when the Emperor Frederick II challenged the power of Pope Innocent IV. Two distinct camps formed: the Guelphs who supported the pope and the Ghibellines who were loyal to the imperial crown. Siding with the Guelphs were one of the patrician families of Genoa\u2014the Grimaldi. Throughout the 13th century these two groups fought. Finally at the end of the century the Ghibellines were victorious and banished their opponents, including the Grimaldi, from Genoa. The Grimaldi settled in the area today known as the French Riviera. Several castles in the area are still known as Chateau Grimaldi, and testify to the strong presence of various branches of the family in the vicinity.\n\nLegend relates that in January 1297 Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi, disguised as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. This event is commemorated by a statue of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (Illustration 6) and in the arms of the House of Grimaldi where Fran\u00e7ois is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (Illustration 2).\nCharles I, who ruled from 1331 to 1357, and was the son of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, significantly enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently, they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.\nFor the next hundred years the Grimaldi defended their territory from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence. The fortress was frequently bombarded, damaged, and restored. Gradually the Grimaldi began to make an alliance with France which strengthened their position. Now more secure, the Grimaldi lords of Monaco now began to recognise the need not only to defend their territory, but also to have a home reflecting their power and prestige.\nThroughout the 15th century, both the fortress and the Rocher continued to be extended and further defended until it became a garrison accommodating some 400 troops. The slow transformation from fortified house to palace (Illustration 7) began during this era, first with building by Lamberto Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco (who between 1458 and 1494 was \"a noteworthy ruler who handled diplomacy and the sword with equal talent\"), and then by his son Jean II. This period saw the extension of the east side of the fortress with a three\u2013floored wing, guarded by high scalloped walls connecting the bastion towers\u2014St Mary (M in Illustration 7), Middle (K) and South (H). This large new wing contained the palace's principal room, the State Hall (today known as the Guard Room). Here the princes carried out their official business and held court. Further, more luxurious, rooms complete with balconies and loggias were designed for the private use of the Grimaldi family. In 1505 Jean II was killed by his brother Lucien.\n\n\n== Fortress to palace ==\n\n\n=== Lucien I (1505\u20131523) ===\n\nJean II was succeeded by his brother Lucien I. Peace did not reign in Monaco for long; in December 1506 14,000 Genoese troops besieged Monaco and its castle, and for five months 1,500 Mon\u00e9gasques and mercenaries defended the Rocher before achieving victory in March 1507. This left Lucien I to walk a diplomatic tightrope between France and Spain in order to preserve the fragile independence of the tiny state which was in truth subject to Spain. Lucien immediately set about repairing the ravages of war to the fortified palace which had been damaged by heavy bombardment. To the main wing (see Illustrations 3 & 7 \u2013 H to M ), built by Prince Lambert and extended during the reign of Jean II, he now added a large wing (H to C) which today houses the state apartments.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 I (1523\u20131581) ===\nDuring the reign of Honor\u00e9 I the internal transformation from fortress to palace was continued. The Treaty of Trodesillas at the beginning of Honor\u00e9's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This provided the security to allow the Lord of Monaco to concentrate on the more comfortable side of his residence rather than the constant need to defend it.\nThe courtyard was rebuilt, the architect Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading on the upper level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honor\u00e9 II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On the other side of the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.Further enlargements were carried out in order to entertain the Emperor Charles V in 1529, when he stayed four nights at the palace during his journey in state to Bologna for his coronation by Pope Clement VII.\n\nArchitecturally this was an exciting period, but Honor\u00e9 I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honor\u00e9's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded the end of the rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 II (1597\u20131662) ===\n\nMonaco's vulnerability was further brought home in 1605 when the Spanish installed a garrison there. In 1633 Honor\u00e9 II (Illustration 8), was officially addressed as \"Serene Prince\" by the Spanish king, thus recognizing Monaco as a principality for the first time. However, as Spanish troops were currently in occupation, this recognition was seen as little more than a gesture to keep Honor\u00e9 happy.Honor\u00e9 II was a francophile. Following his education in Milan, he had been cultivated by the intellectual salons of Paris. Thus, having close affinities with France both culturally and politically, he rebelled against the Spanish presence in Monaco. While he realised that Monaco needed the protection of another power, France was Honor\u00e9 II's favoured choice. In 1641, heavily supported by the French, he attacked the Spanish garrison and expelled the Spanish, declaring \"the glorious liberty of Monaco\". The liberty mentioned was entirely dependent on France, as Monaco now entered a period as a protectorate of France which would last until 1814. As a result of this action Honor\u00e9 II is today regarded as the hero of Monaco.Highly educated and a patron of the arts, Honor\u00e9 II, secure on his throne, began collecting works by Titian, D\u00fcrer, Raphael, Rubens and Michelangelo which formed the basis of the art collection that furnished the palace slowly evolving from the Monaco fortress. Over the following 30-year period he transformed it into a palace suitable for a prince (Illustration 9).\nHe commissioned the architect Jacques Catone not only to enlarge the palace, but also to soften its grim fortified appearance. The main fa\u00e7ade facing the square, the \"front\" of the palace, was given decorative embellishments. The upper loggias (B) to the right of the entrance were glazed. Inside the palace the State Rooms Wing was restyled and the enfilade of state apartments created. A new chapel adorned by a cupola (built on the site marked D) was dedicated to St John the Baptist. This new work helped conceal the forbidding Serravalle Bastion from the courtyard, to create the lighter atmosphere of a Renaissance palazzo.\n\n\n== Absentee landlords and revolution (1662\u20131815) ==\n\nDuring the late 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an independent state, it was in reality a province of France. Its rulers spent much of their time at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure of Versailles was greater than that of their own country.\nHonor\u00e9 II was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Louis I. The new prince had an urbane personality and spent much time with his wife at the French court, where he enjoyed the unusual distinction of being both a foreign head of state and a peer of France. Impressed by the palaces of the French king, who had employed the architect Jean du Cerceau to carry out alterations to the palace at Fontainebleau, Louis I used Fontainebleau as the inspiration for enhancements to his palace at Monaco. Thus he was responsible for two of the palace's most notable features: the entrance\u2014a huge Baroque arch surmounted by a broken pediment bearing the Grimaldi Arms (Illustration 10)\u2014and more memorable still, a double horseshoe staircase modelled on that at Fontainebleau. The thirty steps which compose the staircase are said to have been sculpted from a single block of Carrara marble.  Both the architrave of the new entrance and the horseshoe stairs were designed by Antoine Grigho, an architect from Como.A prince noted for the permissiveness of his private life, Louis I's prodigality was notorious. While visiting England in 1677 he incurred the ire of King Charles II by showering expensive gifts on Hortense Mancini, the king's mistress. The English and Prince Louis later became political enemies when Louis took part in the Anglo-Dutch Wars against England, leading his own Monaco Cavalry into battles in Flanders and Franche-Comt\u00e9. These acts earned Louis the gratitude of Louis XIV who made him ambassador to the Holy See, charged with securing the Spanish Succession. However, the cost of upholding his position at the papal court caused him to sell most of his grandfather Honor\u00e9 II's art collection, denuding the palace he had earlier so spectacularly enhanced. Louis died before securing the Spanish throne for France, an act which would have earned the Grimaldi huge rewards. Instead Europe was immediately plunged into turmoil as the War of the Spanish Succession began.\n\nIn 1701, Prince Antoine succeeded Louis I and inherited an almost bankrupt Monaco, though he did further embellish the Royal Room. On its ceiling, Gregorio de Ferrari and Alexandre Haffner depicted a figure of Fame surrounded by lunettes illustrating the four seasons.\nAntoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Mon\u00e9gasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honor\u00e9 III.Honor\u00e9 III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honor\u00e9 III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798.\nThe Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honor\u00e9 III's son and heir, the future Honor\u00e9 IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be governed by others, most notably a former tutor. It was on one of Honor\u00e9 III's rare visits to the palace in 1767 that illness forced Edward, Duke of York, to land at Monaco. The sick duke was allocated the state bedchamber where he promptly died. Since that date the room has been known as the York Room.\nDespite its lack of continuous occupancy, by the final quarter of the 18th century the palace was once again a \"splendid place\" (Illustration 12). However revolution was afoot, and in the late 1780s Honor\u00e9 III had to make concessions to his people who had caught the revolutionary ideas from their French neighbours. This was only the beginning of the Grimaldi's problems. In 1793 the leaders of the French Revolution annexed Monaco. The prince was imprisoned in France and his property and estates, including the palace, were forfeited to France.\nThe palace was looted by the prince's subjects, and what remained of the furnishings and art collection was auctioned by the French government. Further changes were heaped on both the country and palace. Monaco was renamed Fort d'Hercule and became a canton of France while the palace became a military hospital and poorhouse. In Paris, the prince's daughter-in-law Francoise-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul-Stainville (1766\u20131794) was executed, one of the last to be guillotined during the Reign of Terror.  Honor\u00e9 III died in 1795 in Paris, where he had spent most of his life, without regaining his throne.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Regaining the palace ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was succeeded by his son Honor\u00e9 IV (1758\u20131819) whose marriage to Louise d'Aumont Mazarin had done so much to restore the Grimaldi fortunes. Much of this fortune had been depleted by the hardships of the revolution. On 17 June 1814 under the Treaty of Paris, the Principality of Monaco was restored to Honor\u00e9 IV.\nThe fabric of the palace had been completely neglected during the years in which the Grimaldi had been exiled from Monaco. Such was the state of disrepair that part of the east wing had to be demolished along with Honor\u00e9 II's bathing pavilion, which stood on the site occupied today by the palace's former Napoleon Museum, which closed in 2014, and the building housing the palace archives.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV died shortly after his throne was restored to him, and structural restoration of the palace began under Honor\u00e9 V and was continued after his death in 1841 by his brother Prince Florestan. However, by the time of Florestan's accession, Monaco was once again experiencing political tensions caused by financial problems. These resulted from its position as a protectorate of Sardinia, the country to which it had been ceded by France following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Florestan, an eccentric (he had been a professional actor), left the running of Monaco to his wife, Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. Despite her attempts to rule, her husband's people were once again in revolt. In an attempt to ease the volatile situation Florestan ceded power to his son Charles, but this came too late to appease the Mon\u00e9gasques. Menton and Roquebrune broke away from Monaco, leaving the Grimaldi's already small country hugely diminished\u2014little more than Monte Carlo.\n\nFlorestan died in 1856 and his son, Charles, who had already been ruling what remained of Monaco, succeeded him as Charles III (Illustration 15). Menton and Roquebrune officially became part of France in 1861, reducing Monaco's size at a stroke by 80%. With time on his hands, Charles III now devoted his time to completing the restoration of his palace begun by his uncle Honor\u00e9 V. He rebuilt St Mary's Tower (Illustration 14) and completely restored the chapel, adding a new altar, and having its vaulted ceiling painted with frescoes, while outside the fa\u00e7ade was painted by Jacob Fro\u00ebschle and Deschler with murals illustrating various heroic deeds performed by the Grimaldi. The Guard Room, the former great hall of the fortress (now known as the State Hall), was transformed by new Renaissance decorations and the addition of a monumental chimneypiece.\nCharles III also made serious attempts to find the various works of art and furniture looted, sold and dispersed during the revolution. Together with new purchases, a fine art collection once again adorned the palace which included not only family portraits such as that of Lucien I by de Predis; Honor\u00e9 II by Philippe de Champaigne; the head of Antoine I by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and van Loo's portrait of Louise-Hyppolyte (Illustration 11) but also such masterpieces as The Music Lesson by Titian.\nCharles III was also responsible for another palace in Monte Carlo, one which would fund his restorations, and turn around his country's faltering economy. This new palace was Charles Garnier's Second Empire casino, completed in 1878 (Illustration 16). The first Monaco casino had opened the previous decade. Through the casino Monaco became self-supporting.\n\n\n=== Decline of Grimaldi power ===\nBy the time of Charles III's death in 1889, Monaco and Monte Carlo were synonymous as one and the same place, and had acquired, through gambling, a reputation as a louche and decadent playground of the rich. It attracted everyone from Russian grand dukes and railway magnates, often with their mistresses, to adventurers, causing the small country to be derided by many including Queen Victoria. In fact so decadent was Monaco considered that from 1882, when she first began visiting the French Riviera, Queen Victoria refused to make a courtesy social call at the palace. The contemporary writer Sabine Baring-Gould described the habitu\u00e9es of Monaco as \"the moral cesspool of Europe.\"\n\nThe successive rulers of Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, a daughter of Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry into the family she contemplated turning the casino into a convalescent home for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice was able to put her plan into action.\nIn 1910, the palace was stormed during the Monegasque Revolution. The prince pronounced an end to absolute monarchy by promulgating a constitution with an elected parliament the following year.\nAlbert was succeeded in 1922 by his son Louis II. Louis II had been brought up by his mother and stepfather, Prince Taszil\u00f3 Festetics de Tolna, in Germany, and did not know Monaco at all until he was 11. He had a distant relationship with his father and served in the French Army. While posted abroad, he met his mistress Marie Juliette Louvet, by whom he had a daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born in Algeria in 1898. As Prince of Monaco, Louis II spent much time elsewhere, preferring to live on the family estate of Le Marchais close to Paris. In 1911 Prince Louis had a law passed legitimising his daughter so that she could inherit the throne, in order to prevent its passing to a distant German branch of the family. The law was challenged and developed into what became known as Monaco succession crisis. Finally in 1919 the prince formally adopted his illegitimate daughter Charlotte, who became known as Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. Louis II's collection of artefacts belonging to Napoleon I form the foundation of the Napoleon Museum at the palace, which is open to the public.\nDuring World War II, Louis attempted to keep Monaco neutral, although his sympathies were with the Vichy French Government.  This caused a rift with his grandson Rainier, his daughter's son, and the heir to Louis's throne, who strongly supported the Allies against the Nazis.\nFollowing the liberation of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis did little for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946 he was spending most of his time in Paris, and on 27 July of that year, he married for the first time. Absent from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived on their estate in France. Prince Louis died in 1949 and was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Rainier III.\n\n\n== Rainier III ==\n\nPrince Rainier III was responsible for not only turning around the fortune and reputation of Monaco but also for overseeing the restoration of the palace. Upon his accession in 1949 Prince Rainier III immediately began a program of renovation and restoration. Many of the external frescoes on the courtyard were restored, while the southern wing, destroyed following the French revolution, was rebuilt. This is the part of the palace where the ruling family have their private apartments. The wing also houses the Napoleon Museum and the archives.\nThe frescoes decorating the open arcade known as the Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who imported works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of the rooms were refurnished and redecorated. Many of the marble floors have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with intarsia designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.Together with his wife, the late Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier not only restored the palace, but from the 1970s also made it the headquarters of a large and thriving business, which encouraged light industry to Monaco, the aim of which was to lessen Monaco's dependence on the income from gambling. This involved land reclamation, the development of new beaches, and high rise luxury housing. As a result of Monaco's increase in prestige, in 1993 it joined the United Nations, with Rainier's heir Prince Albert as head of the Monaco delegation.Princess Grace predeceased her husband, dying in 1982 as the result of a car accident. When Rainier III died in 2005 he left both his palace and his country in a stronger and more stable state of repair financially and structurally than they had been for centuries.\n\n\n== The palace in the 21st century ==\nToday the palace is home to Prince Rainier's son and successor, Prince Albert II. The state rooms are open to the public during the summer, and since 1960, the palace's courtyard has been the setting for open-air concerts given by Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra (formerly known as the Orchestra of the National Opera).However, the palace is far more than a tourist attraction and museum: it remains a fully working palace and headquarters of the Mon\u00e9gasque ruler, a fact emphasised by the sentries on constant guard duty at the entrance (Illustration 17). The sovereign princes, although bound by constitution, are involved with the day-to-day running of Monaco as both a country and a business. Today Monaco covers an area of 197 hectares (487 acres) of which 40 hectares (99 acres) have been reclaimed from the sea since 1980.For important Mon\u00e9gasque events\u2014such as Grimaldi weddings and births\u2014the palace courtyard is opened and the assembled citizens of Monaco are addressed by the prince from the Gallery of Hercules overlooking the courtyard.  The courtyard is also used to host the annual children's Christmas party. Through such events, the palace continues to play a central role in the lives of the prince and his subjects, as it has done for over 700 years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Monaco\nList of rulers of Monaco\nHistory of Monaco\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Augustus (Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus; 23 September 63 BC \u2013 19 August AD 14) was a Roman statesman and military leader who became the first emperor of the Roman Empire, reigning from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. He was the first ruler of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. His status as the founder of the Roman Principate has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of the most effective and controversial leaders in human history. The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana. The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"Year of the Four Emperors\" over the imperial succession.\nAugustus was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir, taking the name Octavian (Latin: Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus). Along with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus, he formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi, the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto dictators. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC.\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis (\"First Citizen\"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, the first phase of the Roman Empire.\nAugustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Raetia, expanding possessions in Africa, and completing the conquest of Hispania, but suffered a major setback in Germania. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed networks of roads with an official courier system, established a standing army, established the Praetorian Guard, created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75, probably from natural causes. However, there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son Tiberius (also stepson and former son-in-law).\n\n\n== Name ==\nAs a consequence of Roman customs, society, and personal preference, Augustus ( aw-GUST-\u0259s, \u0259-, Latin: [au\u032f\u02c8\u0261\u028ast\u028as]) was known by many names throughout his life:\n\nGaius Octavius ( ok-TAY-vee-\u0259s, Latin: [\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0\u026a.\u028as \u0254k\u02c8ta\u02d0w\u026a.\u028as]): He received his birth name, after his biological father, in 63 BC. \"Gaius\" was his praenomen, while \"Octavius\" was his nomen. He did not yet receive a cognomen at birth since his father appears to have lacked or eschewed one, which would normally be inherited.\nGaius Octavius Thurinus: He was given the cognomen \"Thurinus\" in 60 BC, when he was a few years old. Later, after he had taken the name of Caesar, his rival Mark Antony referred to him as \"Thurinus\" in order to belittle him. In response, he merely said he was surprised that \"using his old name was thought to be an insult\".\nGaius Julius Caesar: After he was adopted by Julius Caesar, he adopted Caesar's name in accordance with Roman naming conventions. While he dropped all references to the gens Octavia, people colloquially added the epithet Octavianus (Latin: [\u0254kta\u02d0w\u026a\u02c8a\u02d0n\u028as]) to his legal name, either to differentiate him from his adoptive father or to highlight his more modest origins. Modern historians refer to him using the anglicized form \"Octavian\" ( ok-TAY-vee-\u0259n) between 44 BC and 27 BC.\nGaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius: Two years after his adoption, he founded the Temple of Caesar additionally adding the title Divi Filius (\"Son of the Divine\") to his name in attempt to strengthen his political ties to Caesar's former soldiers, following the deification of Caesar.\nImperator Caesar Divi Filius: From 38 BC, Octavian opted to use Imperator, the title by which troops hailed their leader after military success. His name is roughly translated as \"Commander Caesar, Son of the Divine\".\nImperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus (Latin: [\u026amp\u025b\u02c8ra\u02d0t\u0254r \u02c8kae\u032fsar \u02c8di\u02d0wi\u02d0 \u02c8fi\u02d0l\u026a.\u028as au\u032f\u02c8\u0261\u028ast\u028as]): Following his 31 BC defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, partly on his own insistence, on 16 January 27 BC the Roman Senate granted him the additional name, \"Augustus\", which he added to his previous names thereafter. Historians use this name to refer to him from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nWhile his paternal family was from the Volscian town of Velletri, approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) to the south-east of Rome, Augustus was born in the city of Rome on 23 September 63 BC. He was born at Ox Head, a small property on the Palatine Hill, very close to the Roman Forum. He was given the name Gaius Octavius Thurinus, his cognomen possibly commemorating his father's victory at Thurii over a rebellious band of slaves which occurred a few years after his birth. Suetonius wrote: \"There are many indications that the Octavian family was in days of old a distinguished one at Velitrae; for not only was a street in the most frequented part of town long ago called Octavian, but an altar was shown there besides, consecrated by an Octavius. This man was leader in a war with a neighbouring town ...\" Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time, Octavius was taken to his father's home village at Velletri to be raised. Octavius mentions his father's equestrian family only briefly in his memoirs. His paternal great-grandfather Gaius Octavius was a military tribune in Sicily during the Second Punic War. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. His father, also named Gaius Octavius, had been governor of Macedonia. His mother, Atia, was the niece of Julius Caesar.\n\nIn 59 BC, when he was four years old, his father died. His mother married a former governor of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus. Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great, and was elected consul in 56 BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar. Julia died in 52 or 51 BC, and Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother. From this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the toga virilis four years later, and was elected to the College of Pontiffs in 47 BC. The following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, built by Julius Caesar. According to Nicolaus of Damascus, Octavius wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in Africa, but gave way when his mother protested. In 46 BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the forces of Pompey, Caesar's late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.\nWhen he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he crossed hostile territory to Caesar's camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably. Velleius Paterculus reports that after that time, Caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage. When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the Vestal Virgins, naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\n\n=== Heir to Caesar ===\n\nOctavius was studying and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria, when Julius Caesar was killed on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security. Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law, and so had adopted Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir. Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though Suetonius describes Antony's accusation as political slander. This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents by accusing them of having an inappropriate sexual affair. After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium, Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman citizens adopted into a new family usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g., Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did, there is no evidence that Octavius ever himself officially used the name Octavianus, as it would have made his modest origins too obvious. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27 BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.Octavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy. After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium, Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against the Parthian Empire in the Middle East. This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy Mark Antony. Octavian made another bold move in 44 BC when, without official permission, he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome's Near Eastern province to Italy.Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar. On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavian's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesar's former veterans stationed in Campania. By June, he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 denarii.\n\n\n=== Growing tensions ===\n\nArriving in Rome on 6 May 44 BC, Octavian found consul Mark Antony, Caesar's former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictator's assassins. They had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March, yet Antony had succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome with an inflammatory eulogy at Caesar's funeral, mounting public opinion against the assassins.Mark Antony was amassing political support, but Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers and also made common with the Optimates, the former enemies of Caesar, who saw him as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him. In September, the leading Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying him as a threat to the Republican order.\n\n\n=== First conflict with Antony ===\n\nWith opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws that would assign him the province of Cisalpine Gaul. Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans and, on 28 November, he won over two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.In the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and, to the relief of the Senate, he left Rome for Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January. However, the province had earlier been assigned to Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins, who now refused to yield to Antony. Antony besieged him at Mutina and rejected the resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the fighting. The Senate had no army to enforce their resolutions. This provided an opportunity for Octavian, who already was known to have armed forces. Cicero also defended Octavian against Antony's taunts about Octavian's lack of noble lineage and aping of Julius Caesar's name, stating \"we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth.\"At the urging of Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on 1 January 43 BC, yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls. In addition, Octavian was granted propraetor imperium (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43 BC). In April 43 BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.The senate heaped many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than on Octavian for defeating Antony, then attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus. In response, Octavian stayed in the Po Valley and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony. In July, an embassy of centurions sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa and also that the decree should be rescinded which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions. He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on 19 August 43 BC was elected consul with his relative Quintus Pedius as co-consul. Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.\n\n\n=== Second Triumvirate ===\n\n\n==== Proscriptions ====\n\nIn a meeting near Bologna in October 43 BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate. This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then legalised by law passed by the plebs, unlike the unofficial First Triumvirate formed by Pompey, Julius Caesar, and Marcus Licinius Crassus. The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions, in which between 130 and 300 senators and 2,000 equites were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives. This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was most responsible for the proscriptions and killing.  However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies. Marcus Velleius Paterculus asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them. Cassius Dio defended Octavian as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with.This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies. Suetonius said that Octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials, but did pursue his enemies with more vigor than the other triumvirs. Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Lucius Julius Caesar (the consul of 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother Paullus.\n\n\n==== Battle of Philippi and division of territory ====\n\nOn 1 January 42 BC, the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state, Divus Iulius. Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was Divi filius, \"Son of the Divine\". Antony and Octavian then sent 28 legions by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius, who had built their base of power in Greece. After two battles at Philippi in Macedonia in October 42, the Caesarian army was victorious and Brutus and Cassius committed suicide. Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces. In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa instead.After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. Gaul and the province of Hispania were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen Cleopatra VII, the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son Caesarion. Lepidus was left with the province of Africa, stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.\n\n\n==== Rebellion and marriage alliances ====\nThere was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of Lucius Antonius, who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from Clodia Pulchra, the daughter of Fulvia (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at Perusia (modern Perugia), where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40 BC.\n\nLucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon. Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius. Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others. This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet Sextus Propertius.Sextus Pompeius, the son of Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father, had established himself in Sicily and Sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39 BC. Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40 BC when he married Scribonia, a sister or daughter of Pompeius's father-in-law Lucius Scribonius Libo. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, Julia, the same day that he divorced her to marry Livia Drusilla, little more than a year after their marriage.While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered three children with her. Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40 BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.\n\nIn the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian Peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East. To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Octavia Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40 BC.\n\n\n==== War with Pompeius ====\n\nSextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying shipments of grain through the Mediterranean Sea to the peninsula. Pompeius's own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy. Pompeius's control over the sea prompted him to take on the name Neptuni filius, \"son of Neptune\". A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39 BC with the treaty of Misenum; the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and the Peloponnese, and ensured him a future position as consul for 35 BC.The territorial agreement between the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38 BC. One of Pompeius's naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. Octavian lacked the resources to confront Pompeius alone, however, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37 BC.In supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against the Parthian Empire, desiring to avenge Rome's defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC. In an agreement reached at Tarentum, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 legionaries to Antony for use against Parthia. Octavian sent only a tenth of those promised, however, which Antony viewed as an intentional provocation.Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36 BC. Despite setbacks for Octavian, the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by General Agrippa at the naval Battle of Naulochus. Sextus fled to the east with his remaining forces, where he was captured and executed in Miletus by one of Antony's generals the following year. As Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeius's troops, Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave. Lepidus's troops deserted him, however, and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and were enticed by Octavian's promises of money.Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of Pontifex Maximus (head of the college of priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and effectively was exiled to a villa at Cape Circei in Italy. The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. Octavian ensured Rome's citizens of their rights to property in order to maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire. This time, he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy, while also returning 30,000 slaves to their former Roman owners\u2014slaves who had fled to join Pompeius's army and navy. Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister tribunal immunity, or sacrosanctitas, in order to ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome.\n\n\n==== War with Antony and Cleopatra ====\n\nMeanwhile, Antony's campaign turned disastrous against Parthia, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces. On the other hand, Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength; he already was engaged in a romantic affair with her, so he decided to send Octavia back to Rome. Octavian used this to spread propaganda implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an \"Oriental paramour\". In 36 BC, Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end, and that he would step down as triumvir\u2014if only Antony would do the same. Antony refused.Roman troops captured the Kingdom of Armenia in 34 BC, and Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia. He also awarded the title \"Queen of Kings\" to Cleopatra, acts that Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome. Octavian became consul once again on 1 January 33 BC, and he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antony's grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen.The breach between Antony and Octavian prompted a large portion of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32 BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.Octavian forcibly entered the temple of the Vestal Virgins and seized Antony's secret will, which he promptly publicized. The will would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, and designated Alexandria as the site for a tomb for him and his queen. In late 32 BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt.\n\nIn early 31 BC, Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece when Octavian gained a preliminary victory: the navy successfully ferried troops across the Adriatic Sea under the command of Agrippa. Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra's main force from their supply routes at sea, while Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and marched south. Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antony's army fled to Octavian's side daily while Octavian's forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.Antony's fleet sailed through the bay of Actium on the western coast of Greece in a desperate attempt to break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius in the Battle of Actium on 2 September 31 BC. Antony and his remaining forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.\n\nOctavian pursued them and defeated their forces in Alexandria on 1 August 30 BC\u2014after which Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. Antony fell on his own sword and was taken by his soldiers back to Alexandria where he died in Cleopatra's arms. Cleopatra died soon after, reputedly by the venomous bite of an asp or by poison. Octavian had exploited his position as Caesar's heir to further his own political career, and he was well aware of the dangers in allowing another person to do the same. He therefore followed the advice of Arius Didymus that \"two Caesars are one too many\", ordering Caesarion, Julius Caesar's son by Cleopatra, killed, while sparing Cleopatra's children by Antony, with the exception of Antony's older son. Octavian had previously shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.\n\n\n== Sole ruler of Rome ==\n\nAfter Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a position to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate\u2014but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as consuls by the Senate.Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections\u2014in name at least.\n\n\n=== First settlement ===\n\nIn 27 BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies. Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing bills for senatorial debate. Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike. The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power was unrivaled in the Roman Republic. Historian Werner Eck states:\n\nThe sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire. All of them taken together formed the basis of his auctoritas, which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.\nTo a large extent, the public were aware of the vast financial resources that Octavian commanded. He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni, the public treasury.\n\nAccording to H. H. Scullard, however, Octavian's power was based on the exercise of \"a predominant military power and ... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised.\" The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional constitution. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.The provinces ceded to Augustus for that ten-year period comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Egypt. Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions.While Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out. The provinces not under Octavian's control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate. Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but he did not have a monopoly on political and martial power.The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional producer of grain, as well as Illyria and Macedonia, two strategic regions with several legions. However, the Senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Octavian, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian. The Senate's control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican fa\u00e7ade for the autocratic Principate. Also, Octavian's control of entire provinces followed Republican-era precedents for the objective of securing peace and creating stability, in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.\n\n\n=== Change to Augustus ===\nOn 16 January 27 BC the Senate gave Octavian the new titles of Augustus and Princeps. Augustus is from the Latin word Augere (meaning to increase) and can be translated as \"the illustrious one\". It was a title of religious authority rather than political authority. His new title of Augustus was also more favorable than Romulus, the previous one which he styled for himself in reference to the story of the legendary founder of Rome, which symbolized a second founding of Rome. The title of Romulus was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image that Octavian tried to avoid. The title princeps senatus originally meant the member of the Senate with the highest precedence, but in the case of Augustus, it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge. Augustus also styled himself as Imperator Caesar divi filius, \"Commander Caesar son of the deified one\". With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of Imperator signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory. He transformed Caesar, a cognomen for one branch of the Julian family, into a new family line that began with him.\n\nAugustus was granted the right to hang the corona civica above his door, the \"civic crown\" made from oak, and to have laurels drape his doorposts. However, he renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a scepter, wearing a diadem, or wearing the golden crown and purple toga of his predecessor Julius Caesar. If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the Curia, bearing the inscription virtus, pietas, clementia, iustitia\u2014\"valor, piety, clemency, and justice.\"\n\n\n=== Second settlement ===\n\nBy 23 BC, some of the un-Republican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27 BC. Augustus's retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system, and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters \u2013 Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. He appointed noted Republican Calpurnius Piso (who had fought against Julius Caesar and supported Cassius and Brutus) as co-consul in 23 BC, after his choice Aulus Terentius Varro Murena  died unexpectedly.In the late spring Augustus suffered a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus's supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.\n\nSoon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2 BC, both times to introduce his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.\n\n\n=== Primary reasons for the Second settlement ===\nThe primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary.A second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the \"Marcus Primus Affair\". In late 24 or early 23 BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, whose king was a Roman ally. He was defended by Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena, who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state. Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath\u2014i.e., before Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius\u2014as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals. Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy \u2013 accusations that had already played out.\n\nThe situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.The Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus's legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare, or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus's proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius, or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire. Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13 BC.\n\n\n=== Additional powers ===\nDuring the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the official title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar.This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus's tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum. There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor. Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the tribunus plebis began to lose its prestige due to Augustus's amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the praetorship.\n\nAugustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular \"imperium\" when they crossed the Pomerium \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.In addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19 BC. Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph\u2014for victories in Germania in 7 BC.\n\n\n=== Conspiracy ===\n\nMany of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus's greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus's participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19 BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.Likewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22 BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply \"by virtue of his proconsular imperium\", and ended the crisis almost immediately. It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae, a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.There were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair, was named among the conspirators. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured\u2014without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.In 19 BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold. In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate, as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the fasces, an emblem of consular authority. This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12 BC, after the death of Lepidus, he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the Pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion. On 5 February 2 BC, Augustus was also given the title pater patriae, or \"father of the country\".\n\n\n=== Stability and staying power ===\nA final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus's power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus's imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas. Augustus's accumulation of powers was now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the completion of the Second Settlement, 1 July 23 BC.\n\n\n== War and expansion ==\n\nAugustus chose Imperator (\"victorious commander\") to be his first name, since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory, and consequently became known as Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus. By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed \"imperator\" as his title after a successful battle. Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the Res Gestae was devoted to his military victories and honors.Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet Virgil attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento\u2014\"Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples!\" The impulse for expansionism was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the Aeneid, where Jupiter promises Rome imperium sine fine, \"sovereignty without end\".By the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) and the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), Illyricum and Pannonia (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.), and had extended the borders of the Africa Province to the east and south. Judea was added to the province of Syria when Augustus deposed Herod Archelaus, successor to client king Herod the Great (73\u20134 BC). Syria (like Egypt after Antony) was governed by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus.\n\nAgain, no military effort was needed in 25 BC when Galatia (modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after Amyntas of Galatia was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada. The rebellious tribes of Asturias and  Cantabria in modern-day Spain were finally quelled in 19 BC, and the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and Lusitania. This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus's future military campaigns, as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman mining projects, especially the very rich gold deposits at Las Medulas.\n\nConquering the peoples of the Alps in 16 BC was another important victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monumental Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12 BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus's forces reached the Elbe River by 9 BC\u2014though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body all the way back to Rome.\n\nTo protect Rome's eastern territories from the Parthian Empire, Augustus relied on the client states of the east to act as territorial buffers and areas that could raise their own troops for defense. To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East. Tiberius was responsible for restoring Tigranes V to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.Yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with Phraates IV of Parthia (37\u20132 BC) in 20 BC for the return of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome. Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus's defeat by military means. However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue Augustus of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor ('Mars the Avenger') built to house the standards.Parthia had always posed a threat to Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were destroyed by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany. Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated Arminius, who fled that Battle of Idistaviso in AD 16 but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.\n\n\n== Death and succession ==\n\nThe illness of Augustus in 23 BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed to Augustus's unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son Marcellus, who had been quickly married to Augustus's daughter Julia the Elder. Other historians dispute this due to Augustus's will being read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 BC, instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus's second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.After the death of Marcellus in 23 BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus's authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus's favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.\n\nAugustus's intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children. He took the consulship in 5 and 2 BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers, and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4. Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and Tiberius Claudius (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12 BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife Vipsania Agrippina and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus's daughter Julia\u2014as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended. Drusus's marriage to Augustus's niece Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was \"only\" the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.Tiberius shared in Augustus's tribune powers as of 6 BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to Rhodes. No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia, as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus's apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius. (Gaius and Lucius joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.)After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9 BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus. This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs. In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of Augustus.\n\nThe only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him. He certainly fell out of Augustus's favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a \"vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character\".On 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting Nola where his father had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus's death by poisoning fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus's life, but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius's political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.Alternatively, it is possible that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus's health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.Augustus's famous last words were, \"Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit\"\u2014referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, \"Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble.\" An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus's body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day. Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two rostra. Augustus's body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman pantheon.Historian D. C. A. Shotter states that Augustus's policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latter's death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus. Shotter suggests that Augustus's deification obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored, coupled with Tiberius's \"extremely conservative\" attitude towards religion. Also, historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits. Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on Gaius Asinius Gallus (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), as well as toward the two young Caesars, Gaius and Lucius\u2014instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nAugustus's reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted, in one form or another, for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate decline of the Western Roman Empire and until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title Augustus became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at Old Rome and at New Rome. In many languages, Caesar became the word for Emperor, as in the German Kaiser and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian Tsar (sometimes Csar or Czar). The cult of Divus Augustus continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to Christianity in 391 by Theodosius I. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, to be inscribed in bronze in front of his mausoleum. Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death. The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in Ankara dubbed the Monumentum Ancyranum, called the \"queen of inscriptions\" by historian Theodor Mommsen.The Res Gestae is the only work to have survived from antiquity, though Augustus is also known to have composed poems entitled Sicily, Epiphanus, and Ajax, an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and a written rebuttal to Brutus's Eulogy of Cato. Historians are able to analyze excerpts of letters penned by Augustus, preserved in other works, to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.Many consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated Pax Romana or Pax Augusta. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to \"be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan\". Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar and was influenced on occasion by Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized police force, fire fighting force, and the establishment of the municipal prefect as a permanent office. The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.A praefectus vigilum, or \"Prefect of the Watch\" was put in charge of the vigiles, Rome's fire brigade and police. With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a standing army for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers. This was supported by numerous auxiliary units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum. Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country. In the year 6 Augustus established the aerarium militare, donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.One of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27 BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome. They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was Maxentius, as it was Constantine I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the Castra Praetoria.\n\nAlthough the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC, Augustus gave 400 sesterces (equal to 1/10 of a Roman pound of gold) each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28 BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.\n\nThe longevity of Augustus's reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23 BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus's own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus's ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist Marcus Antistius Labeo (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican liberty in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his Annals, the Roman historian Tacitus (c. 56\u2013c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that, with Augustus's death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another. Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:\n\nIntelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war\u2014and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used\u2014merely to preserve peace for the majority.\n\nAccording to the second opposing opinion:\n\nfilial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts. In actual fact, the motive of Octavian, the future Augustus, was lust for power ... There had certainly been peace, but it was a blood-stained peace of disasters and assassinations.\nIn a 2006 biography on Augustus, Anthony Everitt asserts that through the centuries, judgments on Augustus's reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that:\n\nOpposites do not have to be mutually exclusive, and we are not obliged to choose one or the other. The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as princeps, selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any democratic parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur.\nTacitus was of the belief that Nerva (r. 96\u201398) successfully \"mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty\". The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an autocrat. The poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus (AD 39\u201365) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of Cato the Younger (95 BC\u201346 BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, \"perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.\"The Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift (1667\u20131745), in his Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome, criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed Great Britain's virtuous constitutional monarchy to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC. In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian Thomas Gordon (1658\u20131741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658). Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher Montesquieu (1689\u20131755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle. In his Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, the Scottish scholar Thomas Blackwell (1701\u20131757) deemed Augustus a Machiavellian ruler, \"a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper\", \"wicked and worthless\", \"a mean spirit\", and a \"tyrant\".\n\n\n=== Revenue reforms ===\n\nAugustus's public revenue reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus's predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.\n\nAn equally important reform was the abolition of private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the right to tax local areas.The use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus's conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government. As it was effectively considered Augustus's private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium. Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions. During his reign the circus games resulted in the killing of 3,500 elephants.\n\n\n=== Month of August ===\nThe month of August (Latin: Augustus) is named after Augustus; until his time it was called Sextilis (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original Roman calendar and the Latin word for six is sex). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see Julian calendar). According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.\n\n\n=== Building projects ===\n\nOn his deathbed, Augustus boasted \"I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble.\" Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire's strength. Marble could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.Although this did not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus's triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.He also built the Temple of Caesar, the Baths of Agrippa, and the Forum of Augustus with its Temple of Mars Ultor. Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the Theatre of Balbus, and Agrippa's construction of the Pantheon, or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. Portico of Octavia, Theatre of Marcellus). Even his Mausoleum of Augustus was built before his death to house members of his family. To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the Arch of Augustus was built in 29 BC near the entrance of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, and widened in 19 BC to include a triple-arch design.\n\nAfter the death of Agrippa in 12 BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.In the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum (translated as \"Supervisors of Public Property\") was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult. Augustus created the senatorial group of the curatores viarum (translated as \"Supervisors for Roads\") for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.The Corinthian order of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.\n\n\n== Physical appearance and official images ==\n\nHis biographer Suetonius, writing about a century after Augustus's death, described his appearance as: \"... unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something ... He had clear, bright eyes ... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...\", adding that \"his shoes [were] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was\". Scientific analysis of traces of paint found in his official statues show that he most likely had light brown hair and eyes (his hair and eyes were depicted as the same color).His official images were very tightly controlled and idealized, drawing from a tradition of Hellenistic royal portraiture rather than the tradition of realism in Roman portraiture. He first appeared on coins at the age of 19, and from about 29 BC \"the explosion in the number of Augustan portraits attests a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at dominating all aspects of civil, religious, economic and military life with Augustus's person.\" The early images did indeed depict a young man, but although there were gradual changes his images remained youthful until he died in his seventies, by which time they had \"a distanced air of ageless majesty\". Among the best known of many surviving portraits are the Augustus of Prima Porta, the image on the Ara Pacis, and the Via Labicana Augustus, which shows him as a priest. Several cameo portraits include the Blacas Cameo and Gemma Augustea.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPrimary sources\n\nWorks by and about Augustus at Perseus Digital Library\nCassius Dio's Roman History: Books 45\u201356, English translation\nGallery of the Ancient Art: August\nLife of Augustus by Nicolaus of Damascus, English translation\nSuetonius's biography of Augustus, Latin text with English translation\nThe Res Gestae Divi Augusti (The Deeds of Augustus, his own account: complete Latin and Greek texts with facing English translation)\nThe Via Iulia Augusta: road built by the Romans; constructed on the orders of Augustus between the 13\u201312 B.C.Secondary source material\n\nAugustan Legionaries \u2013 Augustus's legions and legionaries\nAugustus \u2013 short biography at the BBC\nBrown, F.

          "We stopped at the museum while driving on the Grand Corniche. The views were fantastic, and I spent a good part of the visit looking towards the ocean. The Trophaeum itself was impressive through it's sheer size, and it's uniqueness, but past that there is not that much to see.",

        "wiki": "The Jardin Exotique de Monaco (French for \"exotic garden of Monaco\") is a botanical garden located on a cliffside in Monaco.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe succulent plants were brought back from Mexico in the late 1860s. By 1895, Augustin Gastaud, who served as the Chief Gardener of the State Gardens of Monaco, grew the succulents in the Jardin St Martin.Albert I, Prince of Monaco acquired a piece of land in Les Moneghetti in 1912. He commissioned Louis Notari, the Chief Engineer of Monaco, to build a new garden with footbridges. During the construction, Notari found a grotto underneath in 1916. Meanwhile, the garden was finished in 1933. Monegasque agronomist Louis Vatrican served as its first director from 1933 to 1969. He added African succulents to the existing South African plants. After he retired in 1969, he was succeeded by Marcel Kroenlein.The grotto was opened to the public in 1950, but it may only be visited with specialized guides. Evidence of prehistoric human inhabitants has been found in the cave. There is a museum of Prehistoric Anthropology within the Exotic Garden displaying many of those prehistoric remains. It was founded by Prince Albert I in 1902.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJardin Exotique website\nThe Unofficial Guide to the Jardin Exotique with Photo Album",

          "Exotic Botanical Garden as the name implies is an amazing place the village is lovely with the beautiful cactus garden, flowers,  picturesque sea view and sublime atmosphere. The shuttle bus service is available and affordable with less hassle great tourist attraction good to refresh the mind.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, nice cafes, restaurants and amazing historic site. If you want to go by bus, the access to get could be limited, check the time table before going.",
          "Amazing place. I was totally astonished about that exotic place and view. What's more there are great sculptures. I pay only 4\u20ac but it is worth much more.",
          "Arguably one of the best views in Southern France at the top of the quaintest of villages. Parking may be a battle in season but the walk up through the carless medieval town is magical. Plenty of souvenir shops and galleries on the way up \u2026",
          "The gardens are lovely. It's nice to walk in it and be able to take pictures of the surrounding area. The view all around is astonishing. \n\nWe took the shuttle bus and got 1 ticket for the garden via the shuttle ticket. We got the other \u2026",
          "Lovely garden with lots of different areas to explore, the paths winding all over the hill top. There's a great view of the coast back towards Nice. Some really interesting plants, especially the cacti. Well worth a look.",
          "A small but beautiful garden locates on top of the hill. Besides various plants and wooden statues, it also provides a great overlook of the bay. You can reach the garden by bus 82 from Nice.",
          "This is the best 6 euros you can spend ever. The view is stunning, the amount of flora species is crazy. Don\u2019t miss the Mediterranean part of the garden, it is cozy and shady. Try to come here either early in the morning or after 5pm so you can have some personal space.",
          "Beautiful view of the C\u014dte D\u2019Azur & Alps, winding steps through the mountain top castle ruins mostly cacti garden, female sculptures.",
          "The hike from Eze Sur Mer was wonderful and the Exotic Gardens worth it!  The plants and the views on a beautiful sunny winter day!!",
          "After visiting it entirely, one can seat on the refreshing shadow of a stone made terrace and just contemplate the sea. I read a book there for more than an hour and it was totally relaxing seeing people passing by from time to time... Totally recommend it!",
          "A very beautiful and unique garden to visit. I would suggest going either late or early to avoid crowds and enjoy the serenity. Spectacular views of the coastline.",
          "The view from this place is lovely. The plants are rather impressive for people that are not used to them. Given that the garden lies on a peak in Eze, it is not very big, so movement can be an issue with all the other visitors and many steps.",
          "This is a very special place to visit. It costs you six euro to enjoy all the middlesterean sea and different kinds of cactus. Seeing the Eze and the surroundings is very worthy. The temperature is very wonderful for us in September, not \u2026",
          "Crowded, but a worthwhile visit. If you have your water bottle you can refill it inside the garden. Get ready to take beautiful instagram photos",
          "The views from this garden at the summit of the hill on which Eze was built are spectacular. it is well worth the admission price. No real shade though. I suggest that you go all the way to the Roman ruins at the top. there are also some \u2026",
          "Super lovely place.\nHead as early as possible! Lots of tourist visits. Wake up very early and head to straight up. There is a chilling spot with bench. Have a quick breakfast/picnic with plants :)",
          "Beautiful place! Fantastic view. A bit crowded. Follow the parking signs when by car and take the shuttle. Price for shuttle is 6 euro, this includes 1 ticket to the garden. Great place to go to on a not to hot day.",
          "You must go inside the gardens! Pay the ticket and go inside even if you do not enjoy seeing gardens. Reason for this is because the gardens have the best view of Eze. Try to do during sunset if possible.",
          "The entrance fee is 6 euro.\nI have the feeling that people do not go to enjoy the variety of plants but to take pictures on top of the hill. \nThe view from there, however, is magnificent and totally worth it.\nWe hade about 20 minutes for it and it was not enough.",
          "The garden was hardly worth a look. I have seen a ton of cactus from back home. It's all about the view which is spectacular up there.",
          "Slightly of season when I visited and some reconstruction ongoing but the view from the top was fantastic.",
          "We loved this part of Eze! A beautiful walk through exotic plants. It is a lot of stairs for those who find statue climbing difficult.",
          "Be prepared to walk, and be amazed at the flora and scenic beauty of Eze village below near the cost. If you plan on doing the walk down to the village, use the facilities first, and have flat shoes. It's worth it if you are prepared.",
          "Amazing grounds, scenery,  walk.",
          "This is unique beautiful garden. You new few hours to enjoy all parts of this magical garden. The ticket costs only 6 euro \ud83d\ude0e",

          "Simply magnifique... You must visit this place when in Nice",
          "Stunning views. Well worth the climb and small fee [6 euros] to walk through impeccably maintained sculptured cacti  gardens. The beautiful sculputures along the garden add an Italian Rennasaince feel to the panoramic viewpoint.",
          "Exotic garden highly recommended.\nit has fabulous mediterranean sea views.\nThe village is full of little eating corners and beautiful hotels.",
          "A little gem on the hill-top of Eze. Breathtaking view.",
          "Such a gem! Definitely worth the climb up. As a lover of anything cactus and succulent, I was in heaven. This place has everything - plants, waterfalls, statues, little pathways and most of all, VIEWS!!",
          "This place is very deceptive , from town level it is difficult to imagine that there is so much hidden up there. Well worth a visit and if you use the parking +shuttle,  which costs 6 euros,  you get free entree for one person into the garden , value 6 euros.  Nice little supermarket in the town /village of Eze",
          "One of the most beautiful places in the whole world",
          "Really nice garden a bit pricey. Few places to dispose garbage. Would be great if they would have better signs of where to go and not Eze village is overall very difficult to navigate thru because of the lack of signs and good signs. You could see many tourists just walking around in circles.",
          "It's kinda the only paid attraction in Eze, so might as well. Not a huge fan of botany so I shalln't comment on the variety of plants here. \nThe views are nice, both towards the sea and overlooking the village.\nThen again, the strength of this village is really the village itself.",
          "Amazing place. A must see for cacti lovers. Makes great photos and fantastic views from the garden.",
          "A large collection of exotic cactuses. But the view over the Mediterranean Sea is a lot more impressive! Definitely worth the ticket price and if you are in Eze village, it is definitely worth a visit. The sun can get a bit too hot in the summer so get ready your sunglasses, sun block and hats.",
          "Definitely worth the views! There\u2019s a student price as well, which makes it pretty cheap to enter. The plants and sculptures are also very nice.",
          "Beautiful, water fountains found in at the edges of the park near the waterfalls, v refreshing, lovely scenary",
          "Beautiful garden, wonderful view of the coast and the city! Bring sunscreen and a water bottle because you can fill for free. \u00c0 lot of stairs to climb.",
          "Amazing views nestled in an amazing little town!",
          "Definetly worth a visit. Beautiful garden full of cactuses and a majestic view. It was a challenge for me to go up with my daughter (with a child trolley) but it was worth it. Nice view inn all directions. Just before the gardens there was \u2026",

          "Great free gardens in an idyllic spot in monte Carlo.",

          "Excellent view, photo taking lovers certainly should come though it costs \u20ac6.",
          "Eze, the  town itself is good along with the village itself gives you many opportunities to take pictures with House's they're just beautiful, overlooks the Valley. do not forget to hike down the mountain Path that ends at the railway station with moderate trail and many photo opportunities.",
          "Pricing is $6 for adults and less for under 18/students. Lots of beautiful plants, but steep stairs and it's quite a hike around. DO NOT TAKE GRANDMA! beautiful pictures to take and it's great to visit. Definitely worth going up to the top. Make sure you explore everything.",
          "Exotic garden is just an excuse to charge for a view which is obstructed everywhere else in the village. Amazing view, but it just feels a a\nbit scummy.",
          "Really worth  to go \nThe village is really beautiful and special \nUp to the garden is nice\nNo need to prebook ticket just buy when you go upstairs",

        "wiki": "The postal history of Monaco can be traced to the principality\u2019s first postmark in 1704. Stampless covers are known with both manuscript and handstamp postmarks for Monaco and Fort d'Hercule (1793-1814 French occupation); as the principality was once much larger, postmarks of the communes of Menton and Roquebrune prior to their 1848 secession might also be included. Monaco used Sardinian stamps from 1851 until 1860, when by the Treaty of Turin, Sardinia ceded to France the surrounding county of Nice and relinquished its protectorate over Monaco; French stamps with Monaco or Monte-Carlo postmarks were used thereafter. Two forms of cancellation are known for the French period. With the first, the postmark is on the cover away from the stamps; an obliterator with an identifying post office number 4222, or later 2387, inside a diamond of ink dots cancelled the actual stamps. The second applied the postmark directly on the stamps, as both a date stamp and cancel. All of these postal forerunners, particularly usages of Sardinian stamps with Monaco cancels, are far more valuable than the same stamps postally used in the issuing countries.The first Monegasque  postage stamps were issued on 1 July 1885, and featured the image of Prince Charles III of Monaco.In 1937, the Principality responded to a growing interest from philatelists by creating a Stamp Issuing Office. The 1949 accession of Prince Rainier III led to increased importance for the principality\u2019s philatelic issues. During his reign, the prince was personally involved in all aspects of the design and format of the principality\u2019s philatelic issues, and he was quoted as stating that stamps were \u201cthe best ambassador of a country.\u201d  The prince was a noted philatelist and his collection was the basis of Monaco\u2019s Museum of Stamps and Coins.Monaco joined the Universal Postal Union in 1955 and PostEurop in 1993. Monaco\u2019s postage stamps, which are tied to French postal rate, continue to be popular among collectors and are considered to be a source of revenue for the principality.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLa Poste Monaco\nMuseum of Stamps and Coins\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBoule, M.

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series. The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15-kilometre (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182-kilometre (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.Monaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping). In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25\u201327 June.\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three separate countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9-kilometre (1.2-mile) swim, 90-kilometre (56-mile) bike ride and 21.1-kilometre (13.1-mile) run.\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco. An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.A municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide. The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.With Formula One Monaco GP it has some supporter series, FIA Formula 2 and Porsche Supercup. It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and other Formula Junior programs. \nFrom 10\u201312 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.,The women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo. There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco, founded in 1994.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language school specializing in business education and operated by the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales (INSEEC) group of schools.\n\n\n== Flag ==\n\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs. Adopted by Monaco on April 4, 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (adopted by Indonesia in August 17, 1945) except for the ratio of height to width.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.\n\n\n== Relations with other countries ==\n\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentOfficial Government Portal\nOfficial website of the Prince's Palace of Monaco\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\nMonaco Statistics Pocket \u2013 Edition 2014General information\"Monaco\".

          "We visited in the early hours of the morning and we were amazed. Very quite and lovely atmosphere. The surrounding environments were really pleasant.",

          "A must see when visiting Monaco. You will visit more ornate churches, but St Paul\u2019s is beautiful in its own way. Church has many beautiful statues (St Charles Borremeo, Padre Pio, St Anthony of Padua) And dont miss the St John Paul II wall statue outside the church. Princess",
          "At Sunday mass they were having first communion services. It was like going to a fashion show as everyone was wearing their best outfits. Church was amazing and appropriate for the royal family tombs.",
          "The church is a must see visit, calm and cool on a hot day. You pass through the church and behind the high alter is the tombs of the Grimaldis, princess Grace is very popular",
          "a great place to visit in Monte Carlo, the church with a lot of histories. Grace Kelly was buried here. I love every church in Europe, because every churches has different design and unique points.",
          "I visit this beautiful church every time I am in town , in my eyes it's the best church in this part of town surrounded by shops and not far from casino square by foot .",

          "Lovely piece of religious architecture. Small, clean and easy to photograph. Didn't go inside on this visit as it seemed closed to the public but I did hear the beautiful organ music drifting through the doors. Very nice. Not far from casino squadron ave grand Bretagne",
          "Many of the reviewers here have Saint Paul's Anglican Church confused with the Cathedral of Saint Nicholas in Monaco-Ville. Saint Paul's is a small but nice English language church in Monte Carlo a few blocks from the Casino de Monte Carlo. I doubt that Saint Paul's is open",
          "You have a lot of beautiful churches in Monaco, but this one is just amazing and definitely worth a visit, whatever religion you are. Alone the location is worth going there and the inside is just a fascinating collection of Christian culture in an appropriate surrounding.",
          "We were dropped here by our tour guide for the day Cathy of liven up and really enjoyed our visit and she gave us the perfect time to see the church and surrounding area",
          "Nice, big cathedral, probably about average for a european cathedral. Thats not to say it isn't beautiful and grand, just there are so many cathedrals, and many are more ornate. Were there on a Saturday, so we had to run in for a view in between all the wedddings going on",
          "A beautiful structure. There was a line up to see the grave of Princess Grace. Very active church with many programmes offered for various ages aside from the usual Sunday service at 8am/Communion at 10:30. Apparently blessings are help in the church, a separate civil service",
          "The Monaco Cathedral is not as old as most of the cathedrals in European capital cities nor is it tremendously large. Still, it is a pretty 19th century building that combines Byzantine and Romanesque elements. It is perhaps best known for its connection to Princess Grace of",
          "We did a walking tour of the old town also shopped here as our guide advised us too. The church with the royal graves was an attraction I hadn't thought was worth seeing but its amazing the church is beautiful and we came back with some lovely photos. I am glad I went.",
          "a very grand place. A recommended place to go and see if you are going to be in the area you wont be disappointed.",
          "This is the second time I have visited the church, and they now have a portrait of Princess Grace behind her grave. It reminds you of how gorgeous she was. I lit a candle for my late mum, who adored her. It was very quiet this time, and I wonder if it was because fewer people",
          "This is the historical resting place of the royals the beauty of the place is not only the church itself but the surrounding streets and buildings and stunning views from each corner , this area of Monaco is the most historical and stunning .",
          "Our tour group from the Avalon River Boat arrived here just 15 minutes before closing and they would not allow us into the building. A disappointment for our group but still a good place to take photos and listen to our guide describe the history of the area. If you are here it",
          "If you know the story of Princess Grace you will know this is where she rests. They have kept it simple and ornate. Such a beautiful resting place. Archways are stunning. I didn't take any interior photos as I was there to pay my respects to a legend who still has a special",
          "If you are a fan of Princess Grace, don't miss this place. It is also te place where Prince Rainier is buried. Their love is so inspiring. It still sadden me how she died so young.",
          "Not as elaborate as some Catholic Churches. But it is worth seeing because it houses the graves of the royal family, including Princess Grace and Prince Rainier.",
          "This church is not ornately decorated as many Catholic churches but it has a serenity which is in keeping with it's history - we were honoured to pay our respects at the last resting place of Monaco's royalty....",
          "impressive royal church, almost open every day. if you are lucky enough you will catch someone getting married :)",
          "Well worth a visit but busy at certain times so we went round in queue with several groups and lots of guides",
          "Good church, good to see outside and inside architecture. Very nicely decorated inside the church. Very near to the visitor's information center of Monaco",
          "One of my main goals was to learn more of the Grimaldi history, so this point of interest is a must for anyone. Georgous, gardens, walkways, and of course the church itself....anything in the 'Rock' area is a must see if you are interested in the history. And one of the best",
          "This is between the oceanagraphic and the palace. It is a beautiful piece of architecture on the outside, and when the sun shines the light streaming in is worth seeing. An added bonus for some would be that this is the burial church for the royal family. There was even a",
          "This church is a little out of the way but is worth visiting. The outside is stunning. Inside is not as ornate as some of the other European churches but is still very nice. Worth it just to see Grace Kellys' tomb.",
          "Saint Paul's Church is one of the most (or the most!) important religious building in Monaco. It is located in a place near the Oceanographic Museum, then it is easy to see it. I recommend you sit in front of it and look at the facade, it is very beautiful.",
          "every visitor must stop by saint paul's in monaco, it is by definition a place that reflects many historic moments on a personal note, some tourists shoul observe a minimum dress code in respect for the religious setting",
          "Sunny skies even in January. Walked along the path with a view of the water to pay tribute to Princess Grace. Peaceful church with a great view once out the doors.",
          "Sorry to say that we made the walk to the Church but it just didn't have anything going for it over any other church.",
          "An excellent church building, great architecturally both outside and in - very well looked after as it is the Royal resting places of Monaco's monachy - well worth a visit.",
          "The church isn't as grand as some of the Gothic Goliaths located around Europe, but is very ornate and well decorated. If you're in Monaco it's certainly worth visiting, it's a good walk from the Harbour and is near the Marine Museum.",
          "Some thing to learn and enjoy about our past activities and day to day operation in the presence of God.",
          "Took an NCL Jade ship offered tour and was not disappointed. Monte Carlo is spotless. They are expanding the Paris Hotel, but we were there before the major construction began. Thought the excursions were pricy, in the end, the guide told you what you were looking at and the",
          "It's truly beautiful. Once you actually find it, lots of steps so wear flats. The Prince and Princess were held in such high regard that everyday there are fresh flowers placed to mark their presence. Very serene.",
          "Its a lovely church.. getting to it was a bit of a struggle.. lots of steps .. and then you have to work your way through the narrow streets to find it.. yet it really is worth finding.. even if you are not of the same persuasion I am sure you can find it very beautiful..",
          "Being the final resting place of the Prince and his Princess, this church is held in high esteem and visited daily by a large number of tourists. Fresh flowers are laid in front of the crypts daily in honour and memory of the beloved departed souls.",
          "St Paul's is a beautiful church with typical of the area architecture we heard the singing as we walked around to the front of the building and it blew it us away. It really is a fitting resting place of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace, A nice place to pay respects and view a",
          "The fitting resting place of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace, St Paul's is a beautiful church. As others have described, it is not a large church, but do take the time to sit and admire the wonderful surroundings.",
          "A lovely church with beautiful architecture. The grave sites for Princess Grace and Prince Rainier were very simple and classy. A nice place to pay respects and view a piece of history. Worth a stop.",
          "The church is a beautiful building with a nice interior. It is well worth a visit, especially to view the crypts of Princess Grace and Prince Rainier.",
          "It is though this small but elegant Cathedral was built with Grace Kelly in mind. It seems to reflect her in so many ways. Clearly a place were many significant moments in her life and death. It was a special moment in my trip to Monaco.",
          "The resting place of the Prince and Grace Kelly. Well presented and great lighting. The pipe organ looks out of place!",
          "Another one of the beautiful structures built of very light colored stone, effortlessly reaching to the sky to get closer to the source of those worshiped. Rebuilt in 1878, it is a recent addition to the religious houses of Europe. The moment we opend the door to the church we",
          "I like this church, Father Walter is very kind to offer the use of the facility to other churches with rental fee.",
          "I cant believe there is such a peaceful and beautiful place among the casinos and busy every day life of Monte Carlo, kind of magical and like a fairytale knowing Grace Kelly is there.",
          "This is a simple but elegant cathedral near the palais. This is the cathedral where Princess Grace and Prince Rainier married and where they are buried. One will be able to see their final resting place, which had fresh flowers and plenty of pictures of them. The cathedral also",
          "This cathedral is very different in style than the others we saw in France. There was an art exhibit on display in the church when we walked through, which took away from viewing the actual structure a little bit. It was interesting to see the memorials at the front of the",
          "In some ways, without being disrespectful as I believe this was the intent, the church by itself is nothing spectacular that separates itself from other great religious sites of Europe. Ornate from the exterior but pretty dark inside. As you enter the front to there is a sign",
          "The final resting place of both Grace Kelly and Prince Ranier. Very moving. Fresh flowers every day. Obviously she won their hearts in the end.",
          "Like many of the other reviews have pointed out - this is the burial site of Grace Kelly & Prince Rainier. The chuch was a beautiful stop and worth 15-20 minutes to walk through to appreciate the inside of this simple but stunning church.",
          "The church is like most others fairly ornate and more about the structure and the history rather than the religion. Of course this place's claim to fame is the final resting place of Grace Kelly who gave up her acting career to be a princess. Interesting piece of history and",
          "Went on a walking tour with friends. Beautiful church from the outside. Our tour guide provide some great information surrounding Princess Grace and the history. Worth the stroll.",
          "This is a must see for those interested in history. It is beautifully laid out and the memorial to Princess Grace is quite moving.",
          "This is a beautiful church that is a great stop when in Monte Carlo. Like visiting any Church or Cathedral you will get out of it proportional to the time you spend in it. There is plenty to see here so plan an hour or so to spend time to view it.",
          "A lovely stroll around the church reading the inscriptions. Churches have the same distinctive calming, peaceful smell the world over & this was no different.",
          "After shopping/sightseeing in the heat, take time to stroll around this church. Well worth a visit. As always, you may hit a busy time with crowds.",
          "A lovely church in Monaco. Lovely Sunday Service where the congregation are warm and friendly. We experienced a great welcome and it was lovely to see some well known faces. Thank you Canon Allen",
          "Saint Paul's church sits quite beautifully at Monte Carlo; however, there are other more grand church. Unless you are spending a long time at Monte Carlo, I would just admire it from the outside.",
          "Like the last time with the cruise ship tour, we only got to (had time for) a visit to the Cathedral and the entrance area of the palace. Getting this ticket to the Palace this time, Tom thought it would be just some sort of quick room or two to visit --------NOT SO ----- This",
          "Climbing the steps and sitting inside the church was very enriching. It was nice to be surrounded by the Old Monte Carlo Charm."

        "wiki": "A monolith is a geological feature consisting of a single massive stone or rock, such as some mountains, or a single large piece of rock placed as, or within, a monument or building. Erosion usually exposes the geological formations, which are often made of very hard and solid igneous or metamorphic rock.\nIn architecture, the term has considerable overlap with megalith, which is normally used for prehistory, and may be used in the contexts of rock-cut architecture that remains attached to solid rock, as in monolithic church, or for exceptionally large stones such as obelisks, statues, monolithic columns or large architraves, that may have been moved a considerable distance after quarrying. It may also be used of large glacial erratics moved by natural forces.\nThe word derives, via the Latin monolithus, from the Ancient Greek word \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (monolithos), from \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (\"one\" or \"single\") and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (\"stone\").\n\n\n== Geological monoliths ==\nLarge, well-known monoliths include:\n\n\n=== Africa ===\nAso Rock, Nigeria\nBen Amera, Mauritania\nBrandberg Mountain, Namibia\nSibebe, Swaziland\nZuma Rock, Nigeria\nMount Lubiri, Angola\nMount Poi, Kenya\nGreat Sphinx of Giza\n\n\n=== Antarctica ===\nScullin monolith\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\nBellary Fort, Bellary, India\nBhongir, Telangana, India\nMadhugiri Betta, Karnataka, India\nKailasa temple, Ellora.

Unfortunately, the opening hours aren't generous, so if you visit in the Summer months, you can't really catch the sun setting, but have the sun shining really brightly in front of your shots.

The views over the city to the ocean and the Alps are stunning and the waterfall, although man-made, is still a sight to behold and can be seen cascading over the rocks from the city centre. We sat for a while at the top amongst the Roman ruins and enjoyed a picnic.",
          "We got to the park from rue Rossetti and it was super easy walk in the shades, visited Israel cemetery and the to the top of the hill. The cherry on the top was this free lift and the you can immediately drop into he sea!",
          "Lovely spot. Free lift for the less able. Great views.",
          "An amazing view of Nice and it only takes a little bit of stair climbing. Really stunning and not too crowded. Also recommend going the other way down to the harbour. Really nice little path all the way down to the sea front.",
          "Awesome awesome awesome.  The elevator is well worth the wait.  We saw the city, the port, the ruins, the waterfall, and the cemetery.. Woof!  Toilettes are .50\u20ac but are nice for public restrooms.  We did the hill after we had explored the \u2026",
          "LOTS OF STEPS. Wrong idea to climb this in 30 degree heat.\nAmazing views though - can't find it anywhere else!",
          "Great scenic view from the top. One of the best place to take pictures in Nice. Hard to walk up , I believe there was an elevator but you have to pay 1 euro. There was a food store st the top which was decently priced. Huge man made water falls, looks pretty real. Definitely recommend it for all ages.",
          "Amazing Park! Best view of the boulevard from top of the hill. Would love to come again.",

          "There is no Castle at Castle Hill. I'm a tiny bit disapointed. Good view though. Really beautiful waterfall at the top. Don't go up by the stares you see from the beach. There's a better way if you go through the Old town.",
          "Amazing views of Nice. Easily accessible by the lift, but also recommend walking down from the top via stairs as you get lovely views. The waterfall is beautiful.",
          "Beautiful walk up the hill . Different vistas at different points . The waterfall near the top is refreshing to see after the long uphill climb . Well worth the hilly effort for the views of Nice , the sea and the distant mountains .",
          "An incredible walk up to the top. Take the elevator across the road from the #ILOVENICE photo opp on the beach side. Just panoramic views and waterfall. Take some pics and go for a swim.",
          "Beautiful view point. Pictures don\u2019t do justice to it\u2019s real beauty. Be prepared to walk up the never ending staircase to get there. But it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s close to the pebbly and slightly rocky beaches right at the foot of this point. Recommended.",
          "Very big hill with nice view and lots of other things on top like a playground and a shop that has food and soda/water.",
          "Great place to get the great view of the nice city. It has good parks for kids and picnic spots for people. It\u2019s good to visit in summer as the waterfall is not open in winter. Lots of activities going on in the castle area. A must visit place in nice.",
          "Great scenic park on top of the hill.  Fantastic view of both the beach front to the west as well as the port to the east.  Park is not open at night or early morning.",
          "Although it seems high quite easy to get the top  (seats are next to the sidewalkif you are tired). It is definitely worth a visit for the view. If you start from the port, you can come down to the old city - with touching of waterfall - where you can drink a coffee or wine",

          "We had some good views from our hotel, and you can get some good views from the Museum of Modern Art, but the panoramic view from atop this hill is by far the best. The hill has a park, snack bar, medieval ruins, and a waterfall! Take a walk up here and explore what they have to",

          "In July my daughter and grand-daughter arranged to do this walk, and despite arthritic knees I decided to attempt it with them, and succeeded. Although there are lots of steps, they fortunately zigzag and there is ample opportunity to rest and take in the view. There is a",

          "If you head up the western side of the hill, it does look like there are a lot of steps but it isn\u2019t too bad, with several breaks along the way. This gives the best views out back over Nice and the beach, which in the afternoon sun was glorious. At the top, the waterfall is",
          "Fairly gentle walk to the top which then offers a panoramic vista of the surrounding area.As others have noted -\"the early bird catches the worm\"-as early morning the site is relatively quiet and tranquil.Later in the day the visitor numbers can be huge and therefore the",
          "Lots of stairs and it was really hot. But oh those views and the waterfall!I highly recommend. If the hike it too much you can drive up",
          "A big climb but worth it for the stunning views of the old town and dock areas. On a hot day it's worth passing the waterfall near the top for a cooling stop.",
          "After reading someone else\u2019s review with excellent instructions on how to get to the elevator/lift/ascenseur we decided to visit the Castle hill to enjoy the view and see the waterfall that we could see from below in Cours Saleya Market. It was fabulous!! The elevator ride is",
          "Castle hill has some amazing views to offer to visitors. The climb might be a little bit hard for some but the views from the top are worth it. Do not miss the cascade as well!!",
          "We went up to the castle area expecting it to be just a viewing point but this wasn't the case. There is a large area at the top to walk round and views all around Nice, well worth a visit and there's even a lift if you don't fancy the steps up. The waterfall was nice to see and",
          "Fantastic views of Nice and the sea. A bit of a steep walk up the hill but the waterfall is not to be missed it was beautiful.",
          "This is a mild walk up (elevator is also available). You have views of the beach, and the port on the other side. The ruins are very small, don\u2019t expect to see much. Overall I recommend going early when there are less people, and before you have people performing for tourists",
          "We visited on a Sunday and found it not too busy, the steps up to the castle hill are not too troublesome with our sketchers/trainers on. Please do make the time to visit the waterfall as it was breathtaking and the cool mist really cools you down. Great views on the way up",
          "You can reach Castle Hill in different ways, we went through the old town and then up...it gives you great views of the old town and the habour, and of course the sea. It is a pleasant place also to read a book and enjoy sitting in the sun. So chose some good weather to go up :)",
          "you can climb or take the elevator to enjoy the most spectacular views of nice old town , port Mont Boron and airport. The festival is great if you happen to catch it . free music",
          "We included this in our day at the last minute and very glad we did. Outstanding views of Nice and gives you a different perspective of the whole area. Highly recommended and not much time is needed. Take the free elevator, more relaxing and enjoy.",
          "Amazing views...anyone can walk up as it\u2019s a short walk but quite high up! There\u2019s a waterfall at the top as well as a opportunity to see 360 of Nice.",
          "Spent longer up here than expected. Took the lift which was a bit of a cheat but worth the view including the waterfall. Grab a drink from the cafe, take in the views and wander down the other side to the port.",
          "The castle hill\u2019s base is at the end of the Quai des \u00c9tats Unis and is where a former castle now destroyed once stood. There\u2019s a cascade of water at the very top and stunning views of Nice. There are some caf\u00e9s and restaurants. A good place to visit while in Nice.",
          "Easily my favorite Place in Nice. The view is beautiful and the surroundings are lovely as well. It's a shame it closes already at 8 pm.",
          "This was a nice hike that provided some incredible views of Nice. It's sometimes difficult but worth the burn. Don't expect a ton on the top of the hill outside of the views but they are stunning",
          "Very steep climb by the stairs or you can catch the lift! Lovely views of the coastline of Nice and the harbour, there is also a playground for children and a little cafe to grab a drink/chips/ice cream.",
          "We decided to walk up instead of taking the lift. It was a lot of work in 30 degree heat but it was worth it. Don't forget to visit the waterfall ('cascades'). At the top there is a small caf\u00e9 that sells drinks and ice creams. Don't get worried if you hear a loud bang at noon.",
          "The climb up didn\u2019t seem as bad as we anticipated. It\u2019s shaded in parts and there is a mix of steps and slopes on proper pathways. You will be rewarded with fabulous views from the top and when we visited there was a man playing the accordion which really added to the",
          "The hike up (steps and paved paths) seemed long but in reality it was not that bad. There is a cool fountain about half way up which has an awesome view and is actually refreshing with the wind blowing mist. At the top the views are even better of that part of Nice.",
          "Best location in Nice for the views, lovely walk up the millions of stairs.... but worth it, to see the amazing waterfall and stunning views of the area.",
          "Amazing view, kids playground and waterfall. If you decide to take a short break from staying for a whole day on a beach that\u2019s an excellent alternative ....",
          "It took us 2 hours to get down from the hill, because they closed the gates leading down from the hill after we got there",
          "Beautiful place to watch sunset but be aware of that all the gates close 6 or 8pm. We walked all the way down to every gate but couldn't get through.. Finally after lots of walking we found out that there is only one way to get out and it took us twice as long",
          "A wonderful park to spend a few hours exploring and relaxing. A steep climb up or take the easier lift up. It has splendid views of Nice promenade, over the city and over Port Lympia. It has a children\u2019s play area, waterfalls, walks and a small cafe. There are also ruins of an",
          "Nice views from the top. Lots of stairs but worth the trip to the top. A good way to get a feel for the whole city.",
          "Great spot to get some exercise and beautiful views of Nice. Some cafes at the top to get a drink or some food. Good play equipment area for kids with grassy areas too.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a hike up the hill, but you are rewarded with multiple views of the City. Make sure you make it all the way to the top and back to the waterfall. A must do while in Nice.",
          "Walked up Castle Hill from the beach and explored the paths. Great views! Be sure to find the waterfall and cool off in the mist!",
          "Great place to get a view of Nice. Lot of space and some impressive views. Also waterfall worth seeing.",
          "Easy walk up hill Great views Nice little a d affordable cafe at the top. Dont forget to bring a camera! Also there's many picnic spots",
          "We started the day with a free elevator ride to the top of the hill. We wandered around admiring the stunning views of Nice and its harbour. We found several waterfalls along the way and a lot of little spots to relax on a bench. We enjoyed the shade of the trees on this hot day",
          "The Castle has wonderful views and is a super popular place to visit. Be ready to walk up all of the stairs if you come from the city. From the beach there should be an elevator that can be used instead. Breathtaking place! We went later in the evening, still hot though...",
          "The a view from the castle makes you realise why this part of the French coast is so treasured and popular all over the world. No coast line where ever can compete with it. No wonder why the rich and wealthy settle here for the summer.",
          "Great views and worth going up. Good lift if you have a pushchair. Great view of port one side and promenade the other.",
          "We got the free elevator up to the park - queued no more than 10 minutes and one of the two elevators was out of order so it might have normally been even quicker. It's a lovely park area with views on one side of the Promenades des Anglais etc and the port of Nice on the",
          "Glad I decided to walk up here.. quite a slog in the heat but well worth it. So much to see on the way up even just negotiating the narrow back streets once at top the views are spectacular and nice little cafe which is very good value for money for where it is ...",
          "Really enjoyed wandering around Castle Hill and admiring the amazing views of Nice. It is an easy walk, no great fitness required. Recommend going in the morning so it is nice and shaded.",
          "Wonderful public park offering spectacular vistas of Nice, it\u2019s port and C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. Better yet it is free! Well worth a couple of hours while in Nice.",
          "Found this on the first day. There is a convenient free lift to the top at the end of the promenade near the signs for the castle. The views are stunning and the waterfall. The kiosg sells excellent food including chips with friendly service and seats in the shade. The public",
          "Fabulous views of Nice! Accessible by steps and slopes to gain a great vantage point to overlook and take photos of Nice.",
          "A nice walk from the old town to the castle hill and waterfall. The views from this area are fabulous and worth experiencing. The walk is quite steep and not for the faint hearted but it is very doable for most and i believe there is a lift that you get to break the back of this",
          "Wthis castle hill is steeped in history. In prehistoric times it was an island as the Sea was much higher! It gives a tremendous view of the city and surrounding areas. If you don't want to climb the hill on foot, a gudied tour is well worth it.",
          "We went at the height of summer and the queue for the lift really wasn\u2019t bad and it was free! At the top, there is a good playpark, lovely big waterfall and a few excellent viewpoints. The actual ruins of the castle are nothing really, if you compare it with English castles.",
          "The Castle hill is just above the old city. It takes 15 minutes to climb the stairs. The views of old town and the promenade are magnificent. The cascade provides a nice cool hade after the climb. There is a Jewish cemetery on the way up, worth to see.",
          "Good views over whole of Nice but not a lot else to see apart from the waterfall and a visit to the cafe.",
          "We spent one morning walking in the park, having a cup of coffee and admired beautiful views - you can see the port, quai and the whole panorama of Nice. Admired the waterfall, spent time in the playground.",
          "Frankly its the best vue you can have of sea and old nice.you can have cold drinks and some snacks .",
          "Walked up there 3 years ago, decided to cycle this time, you can get three quarters the way up and take the steps to the peak. Very historic, chateau remains at the top, great little park and picnic area. Unbelievable views of Nice, the old town, the promenade and the port at",
          "The walk from Rue de English up the side of the hill is quite simple. The views are worth it. can descend on the harbour side and walk back along the beach front",
          "Note: Castle Hill has two way of getting up. Steps or waiting in line on a hot day with sweaty smelly people and then get into a tiny sardined lift that takes 8 at a time only. I recommend waiting up the stars unless you are impaired. Once up there the view is incredible. But",
          "Certainly worth an hour or two. Easy to get up via the lifts and it offers lots of excellent views over Nice, a waterfall which is great for cooling off with the spray, and a large park with play equipment in a couple of places. It's worth walking back down but plan if you want",
          "I think the steps to the hill open at 8.30 ish each day, we visited in August so got there early to avoid the heat and crowds. Lovely view right across the city highly recommend but not for anyone with mobility issues unless you visit through the accompanied tours.",
          "Well worth the uphill walk to see the waterfall and views at the top! There is a lovely cafe near the top too where you can take a minute to take in the views.",
          "Although it is a hike to get up to the top and the pathways can be confusing you cannot beT the view once you make it Takes about 30 minutes up and about 20 minutes to get back down. Take photos!,,,,",
          "Ok we cheated, we didn't climb, we did a Segway tour up the hill. But I am sure if I had climbed the many steps or the steep road I would have said despite the heat that was worth it There is a lovely waterfall that is also a great viewing spot over the city. At this point",
          "This is a great little place - nice green area, waterfall, great viewing platforms - take water as there plenty of steps and hills up but WELL worth it",
          "Great views of the city with a cracking little waterfall at the top. For those who may struggle with the steep walks there is a lift to take you to the top. There are places to grab some snacks and drink also",
          "Very nice city Nice. Because of the old city center wurh lots of very good restaurants nice little shops. Nice differs from Monaco and Cannes because these cities do not have an ok\u00e9 city center. We 'climbed' the castle near the harbour. We went by l'assenceur' the elevator.",
          "We took in Castle Hill in Nice as part of our self guided walking tour. we approached it from Prom des Anglais and took the lift which is just near the Suisse Hotel at the end of the Promenade. The hill itself has lovely views of the Prom, the Bay, the Old Town and the Port.",
          "Walking is not too hard using stairs, but remember to have enough drinking water with you. There are plenty of places for selfies and landscape photos. Area is quite high so be careful with kids and dogs. Fences are quite low and even risky. Great place to visit anyway.",
          "The best view of Nice from the top of the hill. Incredible and peaceful place to enjoy the nature and the views. Just take the elevator in case you don\u2019t want to climb stairs, it\u2019s for free.",
          "Climbing up this cliff was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s exhausting but such a beautiful, scenic experience. Be sure to wear comfortable sneakers. Seriously. Don\u2019t mess around. The climb has multiple routes but be sure to stop at the waterfall. It\u2019s stunning.",
          "Stunning views of Nice - the town, the port and the promenade. You can drive here (then a short walk), walk up the steps from the promenade side or take the free lift on the same side. Great for photos, picnics or just somewhere quiet to relax. There are several kiosks at the",
          "Place Castle Hill on your itinerary. This free activity has so much to offer: -Breathtaking views of Nice -Beautiful park -Waterfall -Areas to have a lunch -Space to run and/or walk",
          "Even in the mid afternoon heat, the views from the top are amazing. You can see the port, mountains, beach, city and scenic waterfall all in one place. Great photo opportunities. Wear flat shoes though as there are plenty of steps - also cafes do not take credit cards!",
          "This is a great place to take in Nice in all its splendor. It\u2019s quite a trek but there\u2019s an elevator which makes the experience doable. It\u2019s a beautiful site with a waterfall, archeological digs, and spectacular views.",
          "It's worth the walk to admire the views. Once at the top you get a 360 of the city, from the airport, across the beach, over the roofs of the old town to the port.",
          "Not to be missed. Breathtaking views over the whole of Nice Relaxing bar to have a drink/icecream before either walking down and taking in the Jewish/Catholic cemeteries or returning back to old town by the elevator. -but walking down is pleasant and shaded by the treelined",
          "I give this 4 instead of five because I do not see how this can be the number one thing to do in Nice over the shore and town itself, e.g., if Nice did not have the shore or interesting town you would not go there for this hill! That being said, I think you have to go to Castle",
          "You can spend a lovely afternoon at the top of this hill and look toward the city below. The stop by the waterfall is a must.",
          "Before you do anything in Nice. Go up to the top of castle hill and have a view of the Riviera on one side, the port on the other side and try to get a glimpse of the city on the third side. You can climb the hill or the the free elevator. After the hill go enjoy Nice!!!",
          "We walked up but you can take a bus as well, not to miss it just in case it is a warm day and you are not keen on walking. The view is nice and however not much left of the old castle you still get a glimpse of the ancient feeling.",
          "This is a beautiful park with plenty of shade and fantastic views. Make sure you visit it. And it\u2019s free!",
          "We have visited the Castle Hill with the stairs up to the top and via the road down to the Corsica Ferry. Spectacular view. Number one to do in my opinion, although we always visit city castles or churches on top of the town....personal preference to climb perhaps...;-). There",
          "This is better than the old town in my opinion. You got beautiful views over Nice from here, especially during sunset and its a great place to take some beautiful pictures and just enjoy the scenery with your friends or family!",
          "We took the (free) lift to go up and the stairs to go down! Great combo! Views are spectacular and well worth it. Small bar upstairs to buy a drink and sit on a bench overlooking the coast line!",
          "We took a bus tour up on the hill giving us a great view of the entire shoreline. There's a \"turn-out\" for photo ops as well.",
          "While you can drive part of the way up and park your car, perhaps it\u2019s better to walk so you can admire the scenery and views. Along the way there are interesting mosaics in imitation of ancient illustrations (Greek and Roman style) worked into the walls. The walk is certainly",
          "Don\u2019t miss the peaceful parch or the stunning views, there are cafes to drink a coop of coffe or eat som cake at, beautiful walks grass with treas to find shade under and numerous playgrounds to play at, something for all ages. You can choose to walk the many steps up to the",
          "The castle hill is a great place to come and take in the breathtaking views that nice has to offer as you have a complete 360 degree view of everything around you. The waterfall is just a breathtaking and grand as the view itself. Once you are at the top you find a beautiful",

          "you can get up by lift (since 10 am) or climb the 200+ steps. I can\u00b4t remember the exact number. The flight of stairs is rather comfy. There are plenty of \"panting stops and gorgeous views and shooting points When you reach the top walk through all the park and peep into every",

          "I recommend you climb the stairs and spend an hour our two enjoying the 360 degree views of Nice and Port Nice. I have been up here 3 times on my stay and I have used 3 different points to access it, the gardens and ancient structures are a delight.",
          "We stayed right in Old Town and found the climb very nice. It took us about 20 mins to get to the top but the views are amazing. Small snack shop at the top where you can get a small bite to eat and something to drink",
          "We used the free elevator to get up, and had a great time on the top of Nice, including a great overview of Nice and surrounding areas. A lot of great pictures, we got some icecream and drinks, and fantastic pictures... Do use the opportunity to start your trip there if the heat",

          "This is one of the must places in Nice. Thou it is hard work to climb up over the hill. You will be rewarded with beautiful views and fountain which makes the air cooler and nice to breath. One way is to climb these stairs or go on the other side with more nicer climbing.",
          "Not too difficult a walk up to the castle and worth it for the views of the bay and harbour. Nice cafe at the top. Walk down by the graveyards to the old town",

          "We went to climb to this castle on a saturday sunny afternoon. Weather was not that hot (28\u00b0) and as we were at Place Garibaldi, we headed to the castle from there. Our GPS lead us to a dead end (rue Emmanuel Philibert) and there were no indications on how to get to this place.",
          "Beautiful place with awesome views both Promenade des Anglais and Nice harbour. Small shop and cafe on top so you can eat something small like hot dog etc. Nice waterfall on top of mountain and you can walk even on \"top\" of that waterfall. Many good places for nice landscape",
          "After contemplating it in the heat for 5 mins, we decided to venture up the stairs which don\u2019t take as long as you expect to be fair, & when you reach the top of the castle the view of the promenade & the old town is well worth it. It didn\u2019t seem to get busy their whilst we were",
          "Just discover up here on last day so hadn't much time. The views over Nice are beautiful and well worth the effort to go up",
          "A great hike to the top to see the waterfall and views! Paved pathway with a lot of stairs. It does not take too long to get to the top. My friends and I stopped at the cafe to have a drink part way up. Beautiful waterfall with fantastic views of Nice!",

          "Castle Hill was incredible. Beautiful gardens, room for kids to run around and a few snack bars with cool water as well as other drinks and food. Take the elevator to the Hill, but only if you are not claustrophobic. It is free. Just a small tip - the public restrooms were",
          "Park area was a bit tired and could use some better landscaping. The views are work the walk up there and there is an elevator to get up if steps are too much. Good way to see nice and the water and buildings.",
          "Magical Castle overlooking the French Rivera great views of the beaches and the villas on the mountain. Extraordinary fresh water well with spectacular waterfall",
          "It was an enjoyable hike up to the look out point. But not to worry, there IS an elevator that goes from the bottom of the hill to the first vantage point. Walk through the park for a little bit to get to the waterfall and it's a refreshing treat! The coastal view from up there",
          "We visited on a warm July afternoon. We chose to take the lift rather than walking up the path. The entrance to the lift is near Hotel Suisse which is worth sharing since we had difficulty locating it. The views are amazing and well worth a visit. There is a waterfall",

          "As it requires climbing up stairs or waiting in line for an elevator, there is a wonderful reduction in the amount of tourists at this site. We walked up the stairs and it was not at all difficult, nor arduous, and one can stop at various stages of the ascent to take photos and",
          "Take the lift up for free at the end of the Promenade. Great views across the city, port and promenade. Took stairs down to see the waterfall too. A couple of kiosks to grab a drink and ice cream. Note little Nice train does not travel up Castle hill anymore which is a shame.",
          "Make sure you visit 'castle Hill' its definitely worth the effort - especially on a nice day (lol) (lol)",
          "This is the gift that keeps on giving. Take the stairs up from the promenade des anglais to tour ballenda for a quick viewpoint. Then keep traveling up the slope by the trees until you reach the waterfall. It is amazing and one you must see when visiting Nice. It is spectacular",
          "We enjoyed the great views of Nice -- Promenade des Anglais, the old town and the port -- from the top of the Castle hill. It's a bit of a walk up the stairs, but there was a sign for an elevator as well, so you could use that if you don't want to walk up. At the top of the",

          "It was very nice to see the view of the city and the port from there. BUT, we were told there sdould be a waterfall there, and we fount it but it was dry :( . so if youre going in the summer, BE WARNED.",
          "Have been here several times before, and always loved the place, both the ancient ruins and the great views. So dissapointed to discover that the place has turned into a carnival with people selling trash all over the place, covering the ruins. Litter all over place.... do not",
          "Castle Hill gives you an interesting view over Nice - old and modern. You can climb up using the stairs or you queue for the lift (ascenseur), however because of its limited capacity you have to wait a long time. Less people in the morning - not recommended if you have young",
          "It is definitely worth making the effort to walk up to the top of Castle Hill as the views of Nice are spectacular. Beautiful shady park at the top to sit and enjoy the view",
          "Castle hill is a wonderful way to get some exercise. It also provides you with stunning views of the city and coastline. The mist from the waterfall will cool you off. If you go later in the day, take a picnic. There is a park with plenty of shade. I enjoy being among the people",
          "We had heard that climbing the stairs up Castle Hill was worth the effort (even in summer heat) because of the view. What we had missed was that there is an historic cemetery with multiple generation stones/crypts of families representing the combined Italian and French",
          "The castle hill was the end of our walking tour of Nice and the Old town. It was interesting to hear that the stone from the castle was used to construct the promenade des anglais. It was a pity to see that only remnants of the castle remain as well as the church site currently",
          "We went to the top via the free lift, and worked our way around all of the castle (there is actually no castle). The views from the top are breath taking across all Nice, we walked down via all the steps.",
          "Was a bit of a climb but had great views and a great park at the top. Also a cafe at the top, and some old ruins.",
          "Amazing views for all the directions \ud83d\ude0e Hike up late afternoon while it's not that hot anymore. Take great photos of the waterfall and enjoy the view from the top.",
          "It\u2019s a good place where you\u2019ll find a nice scenery and a stunning view over Nice. There is an elevator if you think that the steps are too much for you:).",
          "We decided to climb the hill earlish in the morning , before it got too hot. 208 steps up and would you believe it, 208 steps down, superb panoramic view of NIce, Well worth the trek",
          "Took e-bike tour to top on afternoon of first day. Passed others walking bikes up steep hill. Grateful for e-bike. Great views of city and port. Refreshing waterfall on way up. Will return to climb stairs this morning to see city in different light. Easy walk from Old Town area.",
          "This is a must visit in Nice. It is free of charge and it gives a great view of the whole city and also the waterfall is great especially in warm days. There are a lot of stairs but there is also a lift but the lift is only available on certain hours. Highly recommended.",
          "Came twice during my visit to Nice. So many stunning viewpoints! I took the lift up both times, and was a wise decision! Plenty of places to sit down and take in the scenery. A must do!",
          "Get walk and very pleasant afternoon spent wandering around the Castle Hill, all topped offor with a beer at the top and a walk back down to the old town. Would recommend",
          "Great place with wonderful views of Nice and the harbor. You can climb the steps or take the elevator. You will see a cascade, on your way up and right above it, is the very top of hill/castle. If you are not in a rush, 2 hours is more than plenty of time to get there,",
          "The views of the city from atop the hill are fantastic. We took the elevators, which are small, but certainly beat the alternative of walking.",
          "Great views of Nice and the harbor. Steep walk up or use the free elevator. Cemetery very interesting too.",
          "This is well worth a visit when in Nice. Stunning views and lovely scenery with multiple places to take pictures from along the way to the top. We walked but there is an elevator available.",
          "Got some beautiful views of Nice from the top. Elevator stops around 5 or so. We walked to the top. Not too bad for a 70 year old. Beware though and check when park closes. Police ushered us out by 8 which partly defeated the purpose of going there since we wanted sunset views.",
          "Gorgeous overview of the city. Lovely park space, No castle any longer on castle hill (destroyed by Louis XIV) but he could not destroy the view. well worth the time and the climb",
          "A steep climb up many steps, but worth it for the view. It was very busy, with people going up and down competing for the handrails, so not ideal for someone elderly. Views from the top are spectacular!",
          "If you want to have an overview of Nice before going to discover the city, this is the place where you must go! it gives you a great on the entire city of Nice. The place is called \"castle\" while there is no castle anymore, but there used to be, it was destroyed in the XVIII by",
          "Came upon Castle Gill from Port side and signage was not very good. Saw some steps so took a chance. After a long climb and many steps, finally arrived at top. Great views and photo opportunities. Not much to do apart from a well deserved drink. Children\u2019s park and a couple of",
          "It is quite a climb up to the top. From here, take in the beautiful view of the coast and the old town.",
          "Use the lift to cliGood to use the free public lift close to \"I love nice\" sign to climb up and walk down through the old town",
          "One of the best parts of Nice, it\u2019s a steep climb but only maybe 25 minutes. The views are breathtaking and there is so much to walk around and take in. The waterfall is also lovely. This is a free activity and definitely worth the walk. We spent about an hour and half just",
          "A steep walk uphill from the port , but worth it. Spectacular views of the city and the coast . And it\u2019s free. Not much remains of the castle now , but there are some beautiful viewing spots on the wall uphill, including a waterfall/fountain . The elevator was out of service .",
          "Not to be missed at all , wonderful view overlooking nice .. there's a free elevator that took u there at the end of promenade des Anglais .",
          "We loved Nice. All day on the beach (stones) and in the evening we could enjoy the city. The airport allmost at walking distance, a trainstation to see more of the French coast, a verry good destination!",
          "Overlooking Nice this vista gives you a magnificent outlook of Nice from old town to the airport. The azure water gives reason to the title of this amazing coastline. Highlight were the pink doves and the park on the hill. Bit of a hike to the top but good exercise and worth the",
          "The walk up is not bad. Great views of Nice and Old Nice. Then on the other side you see the harbor. In less that 4 hours we visited Old Nice, walked up to the top, at lunch, strolled down the other side to the harbor / port and had a pint.",
          "If you visit Nice you have to go and visit this place, wich is a big park as well.. I took the lift, which was a 15 20 min wait i the que.. And it's free.. The views are amazing.. There is a terrace as well with drinks, but pricey..",
          "Beautiful view, you can take the stairs as we did or if you\u2019re not into a hike you may take the lift. It is definitely a must see while in Nice. The views are breathtaking.",
          "Great views of the old town and promenade. Take the lift up and stroll back down by the stairs to catch great views. A must do in Nice.",
          "Glad that there is a free public lift to access the Castle - not that there is actually a castle to see - but this is the place to take in the views of the Promenade, the port and the city.",
          "Take some time and do this. Its a lot of stairs to climb, but well worth if for the view of the entire coast. Super high and extremely cool views that you can't get anywhere else in the area. Definitely 100% worth doing no matter how long you are in Nice. This is a must do.",
          "We found the free lift tucked away at the base of the cliff. The trip up is a bit claustrophobic but it saves the steep steps. Once at the top, there are great (stroller and wheelchair friendly) walks with views back towards Nice and the airport, and towards the Port. There",
          "This is my third visit to Nice but only my first time hiking up Castle Hill. We had just arrived from the US the day before and we were out walking off our jet lag. It was a spontaneous trip up, up, up with my 19-year-old fit, outdoorsy son! My middle-aged, out-of-shape body had",
          "Castle Hill was a good way to get our steps in. It was a bit of a hike up many stairs, but the views from the top make up for the effort. While exploring, we found the elevator that goes both ways right off the promenade.",
          "We climbed up from old town, but we found an elevator later. The views of both het port and Nice are fantastic. The castle is no longer there.",
          "A good walk and climb and rewarded with lovely views of Nice at different points on the way up and down",
          "Well worth following the path to the top of the hill and then down to port side. The cool greenery is full of bird life and the views from the top are splendid. Buy a drink at the cafe at the top and spend some time enjoying the quiet gardens.",
          "We arrived in Nice and took a wander along the beach front. We saw a waterfall high up on the hill and walked in the direction. We climbed lots of stairs to get there. When you get to the top the views are stunning. Really really glad we made the effort to get to the top.",
          "A good spot up high to gain views over Vielle Nice and the Nice Marina on the other side. The waterfall experience on the slope is also an enjoyable experience. Remain dry if you think you can? Possible but probably not.",
          "Great view over Nice, great little cafe for freshly made baguettes or a sort of pizza (they call it bruschetta, but it\u2019s more like a smallish pizza with mozzarella style cheese etc) and drinks at very reasonable prices. The steps aren't for very unfit people, but most will be",
          "Yes, it's worth your time to climb the hill. It will take maybe 15 minutes to get to the top. You can also take an elevator (we didn't). The views are nice from the top but that's about it. Not a lot else to do other than a playground and a cafe.",
          "A great spot to get an excellent shot of Nice from up high. You can see the Coast line, boardwalk, streets and mountains! An easy walk with a few stairs, is worth it! Toilets are there but not always open.",
          "Took the elevator up and down. Great views from all sides nice park at the top. Go on a clear day if you can.",
          "Worth the climb, we spent a couple hours exploring and having fun up here. Besides the amazing views of the coast there is a beautiful waterfall and a guy there with trained birds. Definitely a fun experience.",
          "Castle Hill is a must do if you are in Nice. It's a bit of a trek (believe me, I heard plenty complaints from those in our group who were not used to exercise), but there are so many little areas to stop and enjoy along the way. There's a beautiful old cemetery to stop at",
          "Ended our walking tour up the top. Lovely views of harbour and coastline. Cafe facilities at the top",
          "There is not much left from the castle so don't expect to see a real castle. Instead the view is spectacular and you can see the whole city of Nice, the port as well as planes taking off and landing to the airport. There are also a small waterfall and playground at the top of",
          "Nice hike, no need to wait in a line for the elevator, and the view points over the city and the Mediterranean sea are stunning.",
          "I took a walk and ended up climbing this hill, it\u2019s not a bad walk but the view make it worth the effort , I later discovered that there is a lift but I\u2019m glad I did it , when you get to the top you can overlook the beach or Nice port , there is a cafe so you have have a drink",
          "If a sweeping panoramic view of Nice and the Mediterranean coast is on your mind there is no better place in the city. Entrance is free. There are two ways to get to the top. By stairs which are accessible all the time and by elevator which is a free service but shuts down at 7",
          "Much has been written about this place. Lovely views, Breath-taking. Good walk to get the heart pumping. No1 place to visit in NICE.",
          "It is definitely worth a walk up the hill to see the ruins of the old castle and the massive and elaborate cemetary. More imprtantly go for the views of Nice and the coast.",
          "A great view of the bay and city with a lovely park for kids. A bit of a hike up, but worth it. There is an elevator near the \u201cI Love Nice\u201d sculptor on the Prommenade. There is a small cafe with ice cream coffee and beer&wine. A must see!!",
          "The walk up to Caste Hill consists of lots of steps from the sea front, it is a little strenuous but there are multiple places that you can stop off for a quick breather! At the top, there is a lot of park land, perfect for a picnic, as well as several ruins that are really",
          "Took free elevator up - small and had to queue as only one working but worth it when we got up as views over city and port are lovely. It is also a peaceful haven away from the traffic of the city.",
          "The place to be if you want to see Nice at its best. A number of steps upwards though have to be traversed if the elevator at the cliff face is out of order, as it was when we were there. But the trip up is more than worth it to see the expanse of Nice and its lengthy Promenade",
          "Be prepared for steps, but the views are worth it. There are lots of benches to sit on in sun or shade.",
          "Well it requires you to trek a bit, but it is worth the effort. Amazing panoramic view of the wonderful and lively city &, the beach area with the sea.",
          "Great views from top. Well worth the climb up the stairs. The waterfalls and gardens up the top are also nice to look at. You can also go down other side to the port, it's only a 10 minute walk back around to Nice along the main walkway along the beach/coast.",
          "It is a big walk but the views at the top are worth it, it is also where you get the 'panoramic' shot of Nice so well worth a visit",
          "parking is free at the top. if you have a stroller perhaps you\u2019d like to access from the bottom though, because there\u2019s an elevator and you can skip all the stairs that way. there\u2019s a little cafe with a few beautiful play areas for the children. lots of green space to picnic.",
          "Easy enough route to the top with option for stairs/ paths or an elevator. A bit confusing when at the top as there are a variety of mini paths that you\u2019re not quite sure where they go, but overall if you can maintain the sense of direction that up is up and down is down you",
          "This is one of my favorite activities in Nice. You can choose different routes for the walk uphill, adjusting it to how much energy you have :) But don't miss the waterfall which is just under the main view point. On the hilltop there are toilets (costs 1 euro but are fresh and",
          "Great views of the entire beach and city of nice from the top. Also see some of the old castle ruins and the port just north of Nice.",
          "I highly recommend to visit before 9AM although the main entrance opens at 10AM. You can go up the stairs next to Hotel Suisse. After 10AM, ppl start to coming in and too crowded in afternoon. Views are superior since it used to be like a fort!",
          "Great view from the hill and the boat trip was super great. My drone got up to 300m altitude and managed to get some nice pics",
          "After a walk on stairs from Old Town you are high above the city with the beautiful Mediterranian in from of you. There is place to sit, to walk, to talk, to view, and to take an outside drink. You can also cheat and take the elevator from Tour Bellanda.",
          "Castle Hill is sometimes missed buy tourist, but I highly recommend visiting Castle Hill. There are so many great photo opportunities there and it's also a nice to just sit and relax and enjoy the views.",
          "Me and Becky wandered around her and was so tranquil and the views of the port and the coast were breathtaking",
          "Used the lift to the top - arrive early, the queues can be very long! Once at the top you get the most amazing views of Nice. Lovely park and refreshment stops. There is also a lovely waterfall. Made our way down on foot, making a few stops on the way. Well worth a visit",
          "We went this morning and it was stunning. The hike up was hard but lots of places to stop and admire the view. It was lovely and calm at the top and there is a cafe for refreshments. Definitely worth it",
          "Beautiful views over the bay. Easy to access. Best panoramic views of Nice. Spectacular at sunset. A must see",
          "The view from up there is gorgeous. There's a free elevator that we'll take you almost all the way to the top. (Be aware it is not always working) You can also go almost all the way up with your own car. But to be honest, the best is just to take the elevator if it is working,",
          "Rather than depending on the elevator, which several people told us might or might not be operating, we decided to take a taxi--great idea! The trip was short, and we still had some uphill walking to do. The views are lovely, and the park area is also very beautiful",
          "There is a lift that you can take just off the promenade and also plenty of other stairways to reach the top. We entered from the old town via steps. The man made waterfall is nice the views of the prom are stunning. The sea looks so blue. It wasn't too busy whilst we visited",
          "The views are great from the top I\u2019m sure and sadly I was only able to make it to the first viewing area as the lift was out of action, a bit disappointing! Be warned if you have difficulty climbing steps for any reason it\u2019s a long way up!",
          "Might be a long way up but the views are worth the struggle. Little cafe at the top so you can take in the park area and all the beautiful flowers.",
          "Pleasing panoramas, well maintained premises and at least minimal information provided for the visitors. It's close to the port of Nice, thus, can be visited after a boat/cruise by the cape of Nice. There are several downsides: 1. The lift wasn't functioning for 3 days and the",
          "Definitely worth a trip (and you\u2019ll burn a few calories on the way up as well). Views are lovely all over the old town.",
          "A steep climb to the top but well worth it for the amazing views and to walk around the waterfall, there is a lift for the less athletic.",
          "Worth the short climb to the top! Intricate stone work on the steps as well as historical castle ruins. Views are 2nd to none!",
          "Well, Nice is a very beautiful city. Everywhere you look in the in the city and in the old town its always pretty. But when you go up Castle hill you will be even more amazed. The view from the top is just wonderful. Go up in when the sun\u2019s out and you will witness a jaw",
          "Wow and wow, perfect location for panoramic views looking over the beach front, take the lift to the top and walk down is my advice",
          "We walked up all the steps of the hill and back down the other side and I have to say it was most definitely worth every step of the way. The view was astonishing (as the weather dramatically improved as we climbed). It was so wonderful to see the city from a different aspect",
          "not too far to climb with great views of the city and promenade de anglais .pleasant area at the top family friendly with cool areas cafe and play areas for kids",
          "I was dreading a steep climb but there's a more gentle ascent up from near the old town. The views across Nice are stunning. There's a lot to see in terms of the Jewish Cemetery, lovely gardens and plants, A man made waterfall and some ruins. There's a cafe and a play park for",
          "There are many stairs, but the climb is well-worth the view! The waterfall is a little phony, but the surrounding gardens are beautiful.",
          "The Walk up to castle hill was worth it. It was funny to see younger people trying to catch their breath while I continued on without stopping! So many amazing views!",
          "Thought we were taking a simple walk up to some ruins only to discover some breathtaking views, some really nice parkland to walk around. A real gem of a place. Worth the walk up the steps from the Promenade if you are up for the climb.",
          "Located between the sea and the old town, the view is just stunning. The sky was particularly clear because of light wind. I spend two hours walking around - I just could not get enough!!",
          "This is a hike to the top but worth it. The \u201cfree lift\u201d was not open when we went. But there is a waterfall and just beautiful views.",
          "You cannot visit Nice without climbing up the Castle Hill at least once. It's an absolute must-see with an amazing view, and there are many nice spots that are perfect for having picnic. The top can be reached from the western, northern an eastern sides. Personally I like to go",
          "Magnificent views! It was a gorgeous day, breezy but sunshine! Take your time and enjoy! Such breathtaking views!",
          "Lovely place away from the busyiness if the city. Wonderful views and easy to get to. There's a lift if you can't do steps.",
          "We got the lift up and walked down. Had a snack and drink from the cafe at the top. Would highly recommend a visit.",
          "Worth the trek up the stairs from the seafront or by road from the old town for the amazing views of the Port to one side and the Baie des Anges on the other. Lovely park at the top with play areas and cafe. Some archeological remains and more recent mosaic steps. The Jewish",
          "A long walk up but going round the back of the hill meant a more gentle climb. But it is a hill! Worth the climb though. Don\u2019t miss the waterfall. The public toilets attract a charge of 50 cents but are very clean.",
          "You must visit this place. It\u2019s not a far walk to the top. Incredible views. If you want to walk further there is a waterfall.",
          "Another way to enjoy Nice panorama is to go up to Castle Hill of Nice. From top of the hill, view of Nice town with beautiful beach is clear and magnificent. Highly recommended place to enjoy Nice at its best.",
          "This is a wonderful hike - looking out towards the Port and then, on the other side overlooking the old town and the mediterranean coast. We love it everytime.",
          "Amazing panoramic views of Nice and beautiful picture opportunities. It is quite the hike up all the steps. There is a little cafe at the top to take a break and grab a drink.",
          "Lovely views from a variety of vantage points so don't feel you have to go all the way but the steps are long and shallow which means you get up to the top without feeling too tired. Great to look over the port on the opposite side to the old town and pick out the choice of",
          "Definitely worth the visit when in Nice to see the views of both sides of the city. Great photos from here . There is a lift option which is helpful on a hot day as there are over 400 stairs.",
          "Picked a good clear day to go to the top of the hill. There are a few ways to get to the top, including a Little white train that runs from the promenade. There is also an ascending staircase and the road way winds up to the top. We were on a Segway tour so got to the top with",
          "The climb to the top of the hill is well worth the effort, the 360 degree views of the old town, the beaches and the port are stunning.",
          "This is a not to miss exercise. If you cannot climb steps like I cannot, take the lift. On Sunday there was a long line (maybe 20 minutes) since one of the (automatic) lifts was out of service",
          "The waterfall is stopped for a moment Renovation works are planned at the beginning of the april 2019. But still - you can see the stone and view. :) D\u00e1tum z\u00e1\u017eitku: marec 2019",

          "Castle Hill is well worth the climb. The views are spectacular. The parks and public spaces atop the hill are very nice. I would put this in my top five things to do in Nice. Historically, it is an interesting spot because you can imagine why this hill was fortified in",
          "Castle Hill in Nice is truly remarkable -- once you get to the top! While there is a single lift on the far side of the hill, if you approach the castle from the Place Garibaldi side, be prepared to scale the mountain...for a bit you simply walk up a driveway, but then you must",
          "You may regret it until you get to the top but the views are the best Nice can offer. Get there at first light or as late as you can (allowing for the closure times and the need to get back down) to see the best views.",
          "There are a lot of stairs to climb (the elevator was out of service), but the views are well worth it. There are some parks atop the hill and some ruins that are being excavated. Great spot for pictures of the city and beach. On the other side, there's a nice view of the marina.",
          "If you are one for taking in views, or admiring the beautiful coastline from an aerial perspective and don't mind walking up 365 steps to the top, this is certainly one place I would encourage you to go on your trip to nice! Amazing views, Amazing Experience.",
          "If you don\u2019t mind steps then you will be rewarded by the most beautiful view on the Mediterranean. Different views from different sides of the hill",
          "We went on the free walking tour of Old Town Nice and were taken up the hill to the castle ruins at the top. What a climb! So many steps I nearly gave up but persevered and the view at the top was great. The lift wasn't working and the toilets were shut but it was worthwhile.",
          "Just climb the stairs and go up the castle for a mind blowing view on the promenade and the beach. Go further up awesome view of the harbor and the waterfalls. You have to climb up the castle if you are in nice. It\u2019s just BREATHETAKING...",
          "Visited Castle Hill of Nice in the late afternoon on our way back to the town centre. The golden hour of light was the perfect time to visit with great view (after climbing the stairs).",

          "There is an elevator (ASCENTEUR DU CHATEAU) to get to the top of Castle Hill - but we found it closed (and it seems as though it really only functions during the high season). So, we took the stairs - every one of the them, and then some to get to the very tip-top - and it was",

          "Walk up or take the lift. the top offers stunning views over the city, the Bay of Angels, the harbour and the mountains. There is even a waterfall. A relaxing place to stroll.",
          "A must-see. I would not recommend to buy a tour unless you are interested and will remember historic details. It is quite a climb, but you can do that on your own pace enjoying the amazing views on the bay of Angels. There are plenty of benches where to relax on your way as well",
          "Superb! Well worth the effort. Castle is on a cliff. There is a lift if you can't walk to the top..but it is super busy in summer... The castle still has bits and pieces left to look at and a little water fall as well. You can see both sides of nice from here...the port and the",
          "You need to climb a few steps to get there but it is wort it Amazing view on the whole Nice. Recommend going",
          "Best place to visit in nice. You can either walk up from several locations around it or get the free elevator up. The views are great, there is a park at the top. It is all immaculately kept in order. The waterfall is amazing and all the ancient grounds are great to see.",
          "Castle hill overlooks Nice and can be accessed by road,steps or elevator. It is a big park with stunning views back over Nice and surrounds. We travelled there on the hop on hop off bus and then walked down the steps.",
          "Ride an elevator or walk. Many steps but good exercise! Small snack bar on top as well as rest rooms. Worth the trip.",
          "For a truly amazing view head to castle hill . Take the elevator and walk back down for sweeping views",
          "Nice is a busy city so it was a welcome break to enjoy the sunshine here. There is a Jewish cemetery, children's playground, 2 cafes, wonderful views of the city, trees, water feature, paths, parking and birds singing.",
          "this is a nice park just above Hotel Suisse, great views of the Nice Port and airport on the other side. The views of the Mediterranean is breathless",
          "Beautiful easy walk and spectacular views. Kids playground at the top. We walked up from the marina side and then back down to the Promenade des Anglais.",
          "It was raining that day but still we went up the hill and it was worth it The view up there was like no other",
          "If in Nice this is the place to go to for the Best view of the Promenade and Nice. Easy access if you take the lift.",
          "We\u2019d planned on riding the petit train to the top, but that wasn\u2019t running, so we then went to the elevator only to find it closed. No matter, walking up the steps was our third choice, but to give you an idea of how much of a climb this is, we had 4 and 6 year old children",
          "This is a must do when in Nice. The climb/walk up from the main promenade is lovely and once you get up the views are splendid.",
          "This place just 10 minutes walk from old town or Nice central. There is an automatic elevator take you to the top of the Chateau. Since then you can walk around and enjoy Beautiful beach and City view from here. Fresh air and relaxing moments. What a beautiful place !!!!",
          "This is a \u2018must do\u2019 in Nice. The views of the coast are incomparable, especially at sunset. There are lots of places to sit, many in the shade, a good cafe and a park for small children. The waterfall is picturesque. Given the amount of steps, you need to be averagely fit. BIG",
          "Probably the best place for views of Nice but especially good for the sunsets. It\u2019s a bit of a hike if you\u2019re walking but we stopped here on our Segway tour. Well worth the effort.",
          "It was quite a hike up the hill but the view was truly amazing when you get to the top. It offers beautiful view of Nice and the sea. If you have the time, you can stroll around the park and enjoy the breeze while taking in the scenery.",
          "This hill rises to about 301 feet at the eastern boundary of Old Town. Just rubble remains of the military fortress that stood here from the 11th to the 18th century. But we went up here for the panoramic views of Nice and the Bay of Angels and found picnic grounds, cemeteries,",
          "What a lovely and nice place. Climbing up the stairs from the beach side to this place is amazing. There is a perfect view.",
          "The view of the city is wonderful, even if the day is cloudy, go up because the view of the city is breathtaking.",
          "We took the small train to go up there it is a nice ride From the promenade and for few euros it was worthed",
          "This was a wonderful walk. Easy to find and with great views along the way. Definitely visit also the waterfall, follow the signs for \u2018Cascade\u2019, you will not be disappointed!",
          "The highest spot in Nice where you can view all of Nice. Three options to get to the top - two are free - the lift and stairs both of which are right off of the Promenade or for a charge the tram which is more to the south. We opted for the lift which was closed so walked up.",
          "It's one of the most stunning places to visit. The views are extraordinary, as one can view the old Nice Port and the expansive view of Promenade de Anglais.",
          "Fifth trip to Nice, fifth time wandering the parks and this beautiful gem. But be aware there is a notice on the lift that it has been permanently closed by the city. Stairs or bust. It would be half an hour taking it moderately, so be aware that the view is more of a workout",
          "Castle Hill can be accessed either via the lifts or stairs or the little train that runs up and down and included a tour of the old town. The views at the top are absolutely stunning looking out over the whole of Nice and the sea. There\u2019s ask a park area and archeological sites",
          "Great for panoramic views overlooking the city and the bay. Don\u2019t expect too much from the cafe near the top around the kids playpark, overpriced and small selection!",
          "Totally worth the walk up the steps although there is a lift. Stunning view over Nice and leads through to the gardens and waterfall.",

          "A must while in Nice - worth the walk! The best view of the city, and there are other ways to the top besides walking!!!",
          "A trip up here has everything - fresh air, exercise, greenery and views over Nice and the whole bay. Be aware that going up there (either in the free lift reached via underground passage) or by the steps, you need to take account of the sun's position if you want to take",
          "Lovely December walk in the sunshine. No tourist train for us we always walk. Great view from the top over the whole city.",
          "The elevator wasn't working and climbed over 400 steps to the top of the hill to see the waterfall. Wonderful views of Nice from the top. There is a small cafe at the top and seats along the way. Lovely peaceful setting spoiled for us by an accordian player at the top,",
          "Le Chateau and Nice Castle Hill are the same thing. Just a head's up if it confused you. There is no castle, or it's hidden behind walls but it does have three key attractions: the tower, the waterfalls and the panoramic view. People also like Israelite cemetery You would",
          "We loved our visit to Castle Hill. Lots of people have pointed out the steep stairs but compared to other areas we have visited (like Rocamadour), stairs were not so bad if you are moderately fit. We enjoyed seeing lookouts and especially waterfall. We hunted for cemetery but",
          "Castle Hill is well worth a visit if you are staying in Nice. The large number of stairs from Pde de Anglais to the summit is well worth the effort. The views over Nice, especially the old town and the harbour are fantastic.",
          "Stunning view! Awesome Cascade, and view over the Old Nice, and the Promenade, and the Port of Nice.",
          "I definite \"have to do\" in Nice. The hike up to the top is a bit strenuous, but really worth it. For those who cannot manage to go up on foot there is a small Elevator, which is even free of charge. Do not miss the waterfalls!",
          "Castle Hill is worth the effort for great vistas. Reward yourself with a coffee to go, from the cafe on top and walk over to one of several great vantage points..example, excellent lookout from above the waterfall over the Promenade des Anglais and the Old Town. Stop and enjoy",
          "The best view and place for selfie in all the Nice is from the Castle hill, which is open from early morning to the late:)",
          "It is very nice up on this hill and there are lovely views of Nice. There is a lift that can take to the top for free. TAKE THE LIFT lol. Up top there is a cafe and nice areas to walk and relax. There is also a lovely waterfall. There are well serviced WCs as well that cost .50",
          "Atop Castle Hill is the best vistas of Nice in the city. However, it is not easy to get to the top. Hiking, Uber, Cab and an elevator are the alternatives. Because my wife has mobility issues, and because the elevator was not working, we took Uber to the top. Unfortunately,",
          "Bring your boule balls or relax walking the paths around this hilltop. Easily accessible via a free elevator. Good location for photos of Nice from a variety of viewpoints.",
          "If you're starting from the promenade, the only way to go is up. When you think you have reached the top, look up and see that there are people who are another level above you. Recommend a good level of fitness or take a lot of rests while going up, there are a lot of stairs to",
          "Nice views, bring coins for the public toilets, park and grounds are not maintained. Disappointing the signage is difficult to follow. This has potential to be an amazing city park.",
          "Hubby convinced me to walk the steps. Glad he did! The views from the lookouts at the top are worth the trek to the top. The view is of the beach and the azure water on the one side, and then of the harbour on the other.",
          "It was a nice walk to get here from town and was a beautiful spot to watch the sunset. Really nice view to downtown Nice and also the Harbor. Interesting walks along the park, waterfalls, and hill.",
          "It's a steep walk to the top. A lot of reviewers have mentioned about free lifts but we were not able to find any. The steep walk was a little difficult for my parents and little one! We stopped in between at multiple places. There were places to sit and rest after every couple",
          "Amazing history and Fantastic views of Nice!! Took a half day tour and it was well worth it!! A must see on you Nice experience.",
          "We stayed right in the foot of the Colline du Chateau. Do not be surprised by the loud sounds at 12noon. It is a tradition to fire cannons at that time. Walk slowly, read small signs of what it is, go all the way up to the peak and watch the water fall and then look for",
          "Visited in November, there was plenty of space and great views from the top. I imagine it will be really crowded in summer and a bit painful ....so if you go in the summer go early and beat the crowds ...it will be worth it",
          "We loved Castle Hill. The views are amazing. There is also a small play park here and a cafe. We all loved the cascade.",
          "It is a good walk to the top of the hill but worth it for the views. The waterfall was on 1 time when we made the walk.",
          "Well worth the climb to the top of the summit. I recommend you walk the paved road up and down as the stairs are too tiring. The view from the top is astounding. Don't miss the waterfall and stop to see the archeological site.",
          "We walked up the stairs leading to the top. I would not suggest this if you are unfit - as it is quite a climb - although there are many spots to rest along the way where you get amazing views of the city. There is a little train that can take you up - train worth it too. The",
          "Did I miss the castle? Lovely views up here but not sure if its worth the trek when you could be having a kir in one of the squares!",
          "In this part of France and Monoco it's great to drive up high and get breathtaking views of the city and the Mediterranean below. And if you get a castle or it's ruins to visit at the same time, that's a bonus. The view of Nice and the sea was wonderful. We snapped plenty of",
          "There is a tourist train that you can take for \u20ac17 Euros that will stop in the castle grounds so you can climb the steps (not many) and take fabulous photos if the ruins and the wonderful view over the Promenade Anglais. Beware, the \u2018hop on hop off\u2019 bus can\u2019t manage the hairpin",
          "This walk gives you a remarkable perspective on all of Nice and the sweep of the bay the city lies in. It had multiple viewpoints, a waterfall and a variety of interesting things to look at around the site. The Jewish cemetary nearby was also worth a visit.",
          "Historic place of Nice that should be visited because of history and breathtaking views. We spent several hours discovering the place and enjoying our afternoon. The weather was just perfect for this. There is some tiny cafe if you want to have a lunch and a small touristic",
          "The Castle Hill is located on the east end of Nice and boasts stunning views of the Mediterranean sea, the city, and the harbor. It is a hike up a lot of stairs to get to the top, but worth it in the end. There is also a manmade waterfall on the way up, and places to rest along",
          "It's well worth the wait to take the lift up to this tranquil place with some amazing views. The walk down is enjoyable too",
          "One of the best views we have ever seen. Simply wonderful park, we had a pleasant walk till the top of the hill. It has a small playground for children where we climbed and had fun. The park has a vary clean toilet, free for children, 0.50 \u20ac for adults. Definitely worth visiting",
          "Although there are a decent amount of stairs to the top, don't let this deter you from witnessing one of the best views of the French Riveria. One of the people in our group did have knee problems and struggled a bit. However, the path is wide with lots of opportunities to take",
          "Wonderful views of Nice and the Mediterranean. Well worth the hike though there is a lift. The waterall at the top is picture perfect (even though it is man made). Walking around Castle Hill for a couple of hours is worth the effort and the time. Great to take the kids up",
          "Make sure you take the elevator up! Or, if you want exercise, or the elevator line is too long (we heard that sometimes the wait time can be up to an hour) there are always stairs... The views from up top are gorgeous! You can see down the Promenade and onto the Port. Both are",
          "The views were fabulous! Very well worth a visit. The bonus is, there's a lift to the top, if the steps up seem daunting.",
          "Must see and go up. It is a long climb up but there is an elevator and the view of the Sea is spectacular. I only gave it a 4 * because there are no bathrooms up there, the one was boarded up and the managers at low elevator level didn\u2019t even know it. There are ruins of a church",
          "The hike up the stairs is well worth the effort for the views across the promenade, and then go around the short walk to the viewpoint overlooking the entrance to the Port of Nice, for stunning look down onto the port.",
          "A short climb up the stairs and you are presented with great views. You get a great view of the promenade while the other side of the hill is the marina. The is a play ground at the top great for a break with your kids.",
          "Quite the workout to get to the top (you can take a car), but worth it! At the very top the view is breathtaking. Also at the top is a cafe selling very reasonably priced food and drinks. Several points of interest and a great park are also up here. A great picnic area!",
          "We came across Castle Hill and the waterfall unexpectedly as we went up past Fenocchios (save a visit to the ice cream parlour as a reward for all that climbing!) and kept going. Well worth the climb for the breathtaking views of Old Town and the bay.",
          "Walked up here on a Sunday morning. Lovely to see so many local groups using the park spaces - running, nordic walking, yoga, pilates and even a wedding taking place! Sounds busy but it's so large a space it was quiet.",
          "Beautiful walk, the climb is reasonable. Only downside is they close at 6pm in October, so we could not get sunset or city light photos.",
          "A nice outdoor place to spend an evening. You have the choice of either a lift or stairs to go up the hill. The lift is free to use. You get a very good values of the Promenade Des Anglais from the top of the hill. There is also a nice man-made waterfalls from the hills. A good",
          "If you are feeling energetic you can walk up the steps to the Castle. For the less mobile there is a free lift which takes you to the top. This is a lovely place to visit and there are plenty of shady spots to rest up. There is quite a lot of grassed areas to rest and have a",
          "A beautiful day out ! Highly recommend when in nice.... views of the prom and the harbour are spectacular",
          "Really enjoyed the views. Nice way to spend some time in Nice. The free elevator really helps take up strollers and people unable to climb lots of stairs. Well worth a visit.",
          "Climbing up or taking the lift up to Castle Hill is well worth it. The views of the coastline, port and old town are amazing. Unfortunately the day we went it was very cloudy and raining.",
          "Took Iift up but there was a Q,and only one lift working, took steps back down, much nicer way to come down. Views were amazing of the old town and beyond. Make sure you dont miss the waterfall.",

          "Definitely worth the climb and steps up. Beautiful views along the coast and over looking Nice Port.",
          "There is a lift to take you up or you can walk up the stairs or the little road train heads up there as part of its tour. Be prepared for a bit of a wait for the lift as there are only 2 and it takes a little bit of time to get people up.and down Nice gardens up there and",
          "To get there you have to climb a lot off stairs there is a way to get there by car. The views are very nice but if you travel around and see the views you skip this place.",
          "Montee du Chateau par ascenceur [Castle Hill] is worth the climb to experience the great panorama views of Nice & the Mediterranean Sea. We arrived to late to use the elevator, but had the change to watch the sunset. It was wonderful",
          "Clean paths, steep climb, but absolutely worth it. You can approach the Port from the \"Old Town\" side and enjoy exquisite views of the Bay of Angels",
          "Castle Hill is located next to Nice old Town and accessible via upstairs, street or free elevator (lift). Green park is on a top of a hill. Several rest areas and view areas.",
          "Definitely worth going to the top of Castle Hill for the views. There is a free lift to the left of the steps (might have to queue in Summer), or you can venture up the steps. Don't just stop at the top step, follow the path as you can go higher and get even better views.",
          "Fantastic views of both the promenade on one side and the port on the other, really nice gardens to explore, well worth the climb to get up there",
          "I can see why this is rated as the number one rated thing to do in Nice. It really sets the stage for an entire trip. Just an amazing vista.",
          "The lift was not working but the climb is not hard as there are lots of seats and viewpoints to rest if you need to . Enjoy each stage, the peaceful expanse at the top is well worth it even though the cafes are a bit disappointing.",
          "We had been walking all day so we took the elevators up and the stairs down. It takes you almost all the way to the top. The views are breathtaking. Worth the climb!",
          "Except the huge number of steps, the place is brilliant! We were with young kids and a pram, therefore had to carry it occasionally, which, on a hot day, is not ideal. Other than that, the hill is highly recommended to visit, the waterfall is brilliant and the views of Nice are",
          "The place to take photographs. The views are spectacular though little remains of the castle the gardens make for a lovely walk and don\u2019t miss the waterfall it\u2019s worth the climb!"

        "wiki": "The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the official residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and besieged by many foreign powers. Since the end of the 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family who first captured it in 1297. The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with their larger and stronger neighbours.\nThus while other European sovereigns were building luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics and common sense demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco one of the most unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.\nThe Grimaldis' occupation of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, the absence of alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted in their use of the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected in the evolution of the palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became symbols of the slightly risqu\u00e9 glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became a chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.\n\n\n== Princely Palace ==\n\nThe palace is a blend of architectural styles; its ancient origins are indicated by a lack of symmetry. Thus to evaluate the architecture, wings and blocks have to be observed separately. The principal fa\u00e7ade appears as a terrace of Renaissance style palazzi from differing periods of the Renaissance era (Illustrations 1 and 12) which\u2014even though they form only one palace\u2014is exactly what they are. These wings are however united by their common rusticated ground floor. This Renaissance architecture seems to mask earlier fortifications, the towers of which rise behind the differing classical fa\u00e7ades. These towers\u2014many complete with crenellations and machicolations\u2014were actually mostly rebuilt during the 19th century. At the rear of the palace the original medieval fortifications seem untouched by time. (Illustration 4). A greater architectural harmony has been achieved within the court of honour around which the palace is built, where two tiers of frescoed open arcades serve as both a ceremonial balcony for the prince's appearances and a state entrance and corridor linking the formal state rooms of the palace.\n\nThe most notable of the many rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were enhanced in the style of those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.Other rooms in the state suite include the Red Room \u2014 so called because its walls are covered in red brocade \u2014 a large drawing room containing paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.\nThe most remarkable room in the suite is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room is lined with Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.\nWhile the overriding atmosphere of the interior and exterior of the palace is of the 18th century, the palace itself is not. Much of its appearance is a result of a long evolution dating from the 12th century, overshadowed by heavy restoration and refurnishing during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\n== Grimaldi fortress ==\n\nMonaco's history predates the Roman occupation of AD 122. Its large natural harbour ensured a steady stream of visitors from Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon. Later the Phoenicians came to trade silk, oil, and spices with the natives. It was the Phoenicians who introduced to this area of the Mediterranean their god Melkart, later known by the Romans as Hercules Monoikos. It was after this god that the Romans renamed the area Portus Hercules Moneici, which has evolved to the present name of Monaco.\nThe seat of the Prince of Monaco was established on the Rocher de Monaco (Illustration 5) as a fortress in 1191 when the harbour, that is today lined by Monte Carlo, was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. The harbour and its immediate area were given to the Genoese by the Emperor Henry IV with the proviso that the Genoese protect the coastline from piracy. Further territory was ceded to the new owners by the Council of Peille and the Abbaye de Saint Pons. In 1215 work began on a new fortress, comprising four towers connected by ramparts protected by a curtain wall. This forms the core of the present palace.\nGenoa was important in the politics of 12th-century Europe. The Genoese were a nation of merchants, and such was their wealth that they frequently fulfilled a role as bankers to the other nation states. However, the Genoese became divided following the rift caused when the Emperor Frederick II challenged the power of Pope Innocent IV. Two distinct camps formed: the Guelphs who supported the pope and the Ghibellines who were loyal to the imperial crown. Siding with the Guelphs were one of the patrician families of Genoa\u2014the Grimaldi. Throughout the 13th century these two groups fought. Finally at the end of the century the Ghibellines were victorious and banished their opponents, including the Grimaldi, from Genoa. The Grimaldi settled in the area today known as the French Riviera. Several castles in the area are still known as Chateau Grimaldi, and testify to the strong presence of various branches of the family in the vicinity.\n\nLegend relates that in January 1297 Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi, disguised as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. This event is commemorated by a statue of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (Illustration 6) and in the arms of the House of Grimaldi where Fran\u00e7ois is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (Illustration 2).\nCharles I, who ruled from 1331 to 1357, and was the son of Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, significantly enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently, they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.\nFor the next hundred years the Grimaldi defended their territory from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence. The fortress was frequently bombarded, damaged, and restored. Gradually the Grimaldi began to make an alliance with France which strengthened their position. Now more secure, the Grimaldi lords of Monaco now began to recognise the need not only to defend their territory, but also to have a home reflecting their power and prestige.\nThroughout the 15th century, both the fortress and the Rocher continued to be extended and further defended until it became a garrison accommodating some 400 troops. The slow transformation from fortified house to palace (Illustration 7) began during this era, first with building by Lamberto Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco (who between 1458 and 1494 was \"a noteworthy ruler who handled diplomacy and the sword with equal talent\"), and then by his son Jean II. This period saw the extension of the east side of the fortress with a three\u2013floored wing, guarded by high scalloped walls connecting the bastion towers\u2014St Mary (M in Illustration 7), Middle (K) and South (H). This large new wing contained the palace's principal room, the State Hall (today known as the Guard Room). Here the princes carried out their official business and held court. Further, more luxurious, rooms complete with balconies and loggias were designed for the private use of the Grimaldi family. In 1505 Jean II was killed by his brother Lucien.\n\n\n== Fortress to palace ==\n\n\n=== Lucien I (1505\u20131523) ===\n\nJean II was succeeded by his brother Lucien I. Peace did not reign in Monaco for long; in December 1506 14,000 Genoese troops besieged Monaco and its castle, and for five months 1,500 Mon\u00e9gasques and mercenaries defended the Rocher before achieving victory in March 1507. This left Lucien I to walk a diplomatic tightrope between France and Spain in order to preserve the fragile independence of the tiny state which was in truth subject to Spain. Lucien immediately set about repairing the ravages of war to the fortified palace which had been damaged by heavy bombardment. To the main wing (see Illustrations 3 & 7 \u2013 H to M ), built by Prince Lambert and extended during the reign of Jean II, he now added a large wing (H to C) which today houses the state apartments.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 I (1523\u20131581) ===\nDuring the reign of Honor\u00e9 I the internal transformation from fortress to palace was continued. The Treaty of Trodesillas at the beginning of Honor\u00e9's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This provided the security to allow the Lord of Monaco to concentrate on the more comfortable side of his residence rather than the constant need to defend it.\nThe courtyard was rebuilt, the architect Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading on the upper level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honor\u00e9 II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On the other side of the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.Further enlargements were carried out in order to entertain the Emperor Charles V in 1529, when he stayed four nights at the palace during his journey in state to Bologna for his coronation by Pope Clement VII.\n\nArchitecturally this was an exciting period, but Honor\u00e9 I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honor\u00e9's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded the end of the rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.\n\n\n=== Honor\u00e9 II (1597\u20131662) ===\n\nMonaco's vulnerability was further brought home in 1605 when the Spanish installed a garrison there. In 1633 Honor\u00e9 II (Illustration 8), was officially addressed as \"Serene Prince\" by the Spanish king, thus recognizing Monaco as a principality for the first time. However, as Spanish troops were currently in occupation, this recognition was seen as little more than a gesture to keep Honor\u00e9 happy.Honor\u00e9 II was a francophile. Following his education in Milan, he had been cultivated by the intellectual salons of Paris. Thus, having close affinities with France both culturally and politically, he rebelled against the Spanish presence in Monaco. While he realised that Monaco needed the protection of another power, France was Honor\u00e9 II's favoured choice. In 1641, heavily supported by the French, he attacked the Spanish garrison and expelled the Spanish, declaring \"the glorious liberty of Monaco\". The liberty mentioned was entirely dependent on France, as Monaco now entered a period as a protectorate of France which would last until 1814. As a result of this action Honor\u00e9 II is today regarded as the hero of Monaco.Highly educated and a patron of the arts, Honor\u00e9 II, secure on his throne, began collecting works by Titian, D\u00fcrer, Raphael, Rubens and Michelangelo which formed the basis of the art collection that furnished the palace slowly evolving from the Monaco fortress. Over the following 30-year period he transformed it into a palace suitable for a prince (Illustration 9).\nHe commissioned the architect Jacques Catone not only to enlarge the palace, but also to soften its grim fortified appearance. The main fa\u00e7ade facing the square, the \"front\" of the palace, was given decorative embellishments. The upper loggias (B) to the right of the entrance were glazed. Inside the palace the State Rooms Wing was restyled and the enfilade of state apartments created. A new chapel adorned by a cupola (built on the site marked D) was dedicated to St John the Baptist. This new work helped conceal the forbidding Serravalle Bastion from the courtyard, to create the lighter atmosphere of a Renaissance palazzo.\n\n\n== Absentee landlords and revolution (1662\u20131815) ==\n\nDuring the late 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an independent state, it was in reality a province of France. Its rulers spent much of their time at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure of Versailles was greater than that of their own country.\nHonor\u00e9 II was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Louis I. The new prince had an urbane personality and spent much time with his wife at the French court, where he enjoyed the unusual distinction of being both a foreign head of state and a peer of France. Impressed by the palaces of the French king, who had employed the architect Jean du Cerceau to carry out alterations to the palace at Fontainebleau, Louis I used Fontainebleau as the inspiration for enhancements to his palace at Monaco. Thus he was responsible for two of the palace's most notable features: the entrance\u2014a huge Baroque arch surmounted by a broken pediment bearing the Grimaldi Arms (Illustration 10)\u2014and more memorable still, a double horseshoe staircase modelled on that at Fontainebleau. The thirty steps which compose the staircase are said to have been sculpted from a single block of Carrara marble.  Both the architrave of the new entrance and the horseshoe stairs were designed by Antoine Grigho, an architect from Como.A prince noted for the permissiveness of his private life, Louis I's prodigality was notorious. While visiting England in 1677 he incurred the ire of King Charles II by showering expensive gifts on Hortense Mancini, the king's mistress. The English and Prince Louis later became political enemies when Louis took part in the Anglo-Dutch Wars against England, leading his own Monaco Cavalry into battles in Flanders and Franche-Comt\u00e9. These acts earned Louis the gratitude of Louis XIV who made him ambassador to the Holy See, charged with securing the Spanish Succession. However, the cost of upholding his position at the papal court caused him to sell most of his grandfather Honor\u00e9 II's art collection, denuding the palace he had earlier so spectacularly enhanced. Louis died before securing the Spanish throne for France, an act which would have earned the Grimaldi huge rewards. Instead Europe was immediately plunged into turmoil as the War of the Spanish Succession began.\n\nIn 1701, Prince Antoine succeeded Louis I and inherited an almost bankrupt Monaco, though he did further embellish the Royal Room. On its ceiling, Gregorio de Ferrari and Alexandre Haffner depicted a figure of Fame surrounded by lunettes illustrating the four seasons.\nAntoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Mon\u00e9gasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honor\u00e9 III.Honor\u00e9 III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honor\u00e9 III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798.\nThe Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honor\u00e9 III's son and heir, the future Honor\u00e9 IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Ch\u00e2teau-Porcien.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be governed by others, most notably a former tutor. It was on one of Honor\u00e9 III's rare visits to the palace in 1767 that illness forced Edward, Duke of York, to land at Monaco. The sick duke was allocated the state bedchamber where he promptly died. Since that date the room has been known as the York Room.\nDespite its lack of continuous occupancy, by the final quarter of the 18th century the palace was once again a \"splendid place\" (Illustration 12). However revolution was afoot, and in the late 1780s Honor\u00e9 III had to make concessions to his people who had caught the revolutionary ideas from their French neighbours. This was only the beginning of the Grimaldi's problems. In 1793 the leaders of the French Revolution annexed Monaco. The prince was imprisoned in France and his property and estates, including the palace, were forfeited to France.\nThe palace was looted by the prince's subjects, and what remained of the furnishings and art collection was auctioned by the French government. Further changes were heaped on both the country and palace. Monaco was renamed Fort d'Hercule and became a canton of France while the palace became a military hospital and poorhouse. In Paris, the prince's daughter-in-law Francoise-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul-Stainville (1766\u20131794) was executed, one of the last to be guillotined during the Reign of Terror.  Honor\u00e9 III died in 1795 in Paris, where he had spent most of his life, without regaining his throne.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\n\n=== Regaining the palace ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was succeeded by his son Honor\u00e9 IV (1758\u20131819) whose marriage to Louise d'Aumont Mazarin had done so much to restore the Grimaldi fortunes. Much of this fortune had been depleted by the hardships of the revolution. On 17 June 1814 under the Treaty of Paris, the Principality of Monaco was restored to Honor\u00e9 IV.\nThe fabric of the palace had been completely neglected during the years in which the Grimaldi had been exiled from Monaco. Such was the state of disrepair that part of the east wing had to be demolished along with Honor\u00e9 II's bathing pavilion, which stood on the site occupied today by the palace's former Napoleon Museum, which closed in 2014, and the building housing the palace archives.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV died shortly after his throne was restored to him, and structural restoration of the palace began under Honor\u00e9 V and was continued after his death in 1841 by his brother Prince Florestan. However, by the time of Florestan's accession, Monaco was once again experiencing political tensions caused by financial problems. These resulted from its position as a protectorate of Sardinia, the country to which it had been ceded by France following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Florestan, an eccentric (he had been a professional actor), left the running of Monaco to his wife, Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. Despite her attempts to rule, her husband's people were once again in revolt. In an attempt to ease the volatile situation Florestan ceded power to his son Charles, but this came too late to appease the Mon\u00e9gasques. Menton and Roquebrune broke away from Monaco, leaving the Grimaldi's already small country hugely diminished\u2014little more than Monte Carlo.\n\nFlorestan died in 1856 and his son, Charles, who had already been ruling what remained of Monaco, succeeded him as Charles III (Illustration 15). Menton and Roquebrune officially became part of France in 1861, reducing Monaco's size at a stroke by 80%. With time on his hands, Charles III now devoted his time to completing the restoration of his palace begun by his uncle Honor\u00e9 V. He rebuilt St Mary's Tower (Illustration 14) and completely restored the chapel, adding a new altar, and having its vaulted ceiling painted with frescoes, while outside the fa\u00e7ade was painted by Jacob Fro\u00ebschle and Deschler with murals illustrating various heroic deeds performed by the Grimaldi. The Guard Room, the former great hall of the fortress (now known as the State Hall), was transformed by new Renaissance decorations and the addition of a monumental chimneypiece.\nCharles III also made serious attempts to find the various works of art and furniture looted, sold and dispersed during the revolution. Together with new purchases, a fine art collection once again adorned the palace which included not only family portraits such as that of Lucien I by de Predis; Honor\u00e9 II by Philippe de Champaigne; the head of Antoine I by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and van Loo's portrait of Louise-Hyppolyte (Illustration 11) but also such masterpieces as The Music Lesson by Titian.\nCharles III was also responsible for another palace in Monte Carlo, one which would fund his restorations, and turn around his country's faltering economy. This new palace was Charles Garnier's Second Empire casino, completed in 1878 (Illustration 16). The first Monaco casino had opened the previous decade. Through the casino Monaco became self-supporting.\n\n\n=== Decline of Grimaldi power ===\nBy the time of Charles III's death in 1889, Monaco and Monte Carlo were synonymous as one and the same place, and had acquired, through gambling, a reputation as a louche and decadent playground of the rich. It attracted everyone from Russian grand dukes and railway magnates, often with their mistresses, to adventurers, causing the small country to be derided by many including Queen Victoria. In fact so decadent was Monaco considered that from 1882, when she first began visiting the French Riviera, Queen Victoria refused to make a courtesy social call at the palace. The contemporary writer Sabine Baring-Gould described the habitu\u00e9es of Monaco as \"the moral cesspool of Europe.\"\n\nThe successive rulers of Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, a daughter of Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry into the family she contemplated turning the casino into a convalescent home for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice was able to put her plan into action.\nIn 1910, the palace was stormed during the Monegasque Revolution. The prince pronounced an end to absolute monarchy by promulgating a constitution with an elected parliament the following year.\nAlbert was succeeded in 1922 by his son Louis II. Louis II had been brought up by his mother and stepfather, Prince Taszil\u00f3 Festetics de Tolna, in Germany, and did not know Monaco at all until he was 11. He had a distant relationship with his father and served in the French Army. While posted abroad, he met his mistress Marie Juliette Louvet, by whom he had a daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born in Algeria in 1898. As Prince of Monaco, Louis II spent much time elsewhere, preferring to live on the family estate of Le Marchais close to Paris. In 1911 Prince Louis had a law passed legitimising his daughter so that she could inherit the throne, in order to prevent its passing to a distant German branch of the family. The law was challenged and developed into what became known as Monaco succession crisis. Finally in 1919 the prince formally adopted his illegitimate daughter Charlotte, who became known as Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. Louis II's collection of artefacts belonging to Napoleon I form the foundation of the Napoleon Museum at the palace, which is open to the public.\nDuring World War II, Louis attempted to keep Monaco neutral, although his sympathies were with the Vichy French Government.  This caused a rift with his grandson Rainier, his daughter's son, and the heir to Louis's throne, who strongly supported the Allies against the Nazis.\nFollowing the liberation of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis did little for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946 he was spending most of his time in Paris, and on 27 July of that year, he married for the first time. Absent from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived on their estate in France. Prince Louis died in 1949 and was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Rainier III.\n\n\n== Rainier III ==\n\nPrince Rainier III was responsible for not only turning around the fortune and reputation of Monaco but also for overseeing the restoration of the palace. Upon his accession in 1949 Prince Rainier III immediately began a program of renovation and restoration. Many of the external frescoes on the courtyard were restored, while the southern wing, destroyed following the French revolution, was rebuilt. This is the part of the palace where the ruling family have their private apartments. The wing also houses the Napoleon Museum and the archives.\nThe frescoes decorating the open arcade known as the Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who imported works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of the rooms were refurnished and redecorated. Many of the marble floors have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with intarsia designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.Together with his wife, the late Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier not only restored the palace, but from the 1970s also made it the headquarters of a large and thriving business, which encouraged light industry to Monaco, the aim of which was to lessen Monaco's dependence on the income from gambling. This involved land reclamation, the development of new beaches, and high rise luxury housing. As a result of Monaco's increase in prestige, in 1993 it joined the United Nations, with Rainier's heir Prince Albert as head of the Monaco delegation.Princess Grace predeceased her husband, dying in 1982 as the result of a car accident. When Rainier III died in 2005 he left both his palace and his country in a stronger and more stable state of repair financially and structurally than they had been for centuries.\n\n\n== The palace in the 21st century ==\nToday the palace is home to Prince Rainier's son and successor, Prince Albert II. The state rooms are open to the public during the summer, and since 1960, the palace's courtyard has been the setting for open-air concerts given by Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra (formerly known as the Orchestra of the National Opera).However, the palace is far more than a tourist attraction and museum: it remains a fully working palace and headquarters of the Mon\u00e9gasque ruler, a fact emphasised by the sentries on constant guard duty at the entrance (Illustration 17). The sovereign princes, although bound by constitution, are involved with the day-to-day running of Monaco as both a country and a business. Today Monaco covers an area of 197 hectares (487 acres) of which 40 hectares (99 acres) have been reclaimed from the sea since 1980.For important Mon\u00e9gasque events\u2014such as Grimaldi weddings and births\u2014the palace courtyard is opened and the assembled citizens of Monaco are addressed by the prince from the Gallery of Hercules overlooking the courtyard.  The courtyard is also used to host the annual children's Christmas party. Through such events, the palace continues to play a central role in the lives of the prince and his subjects, as it has done for over 700 years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Monaco\nList of rulers of Monaco\nHistory of Monaco\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It was well worth the walk up all those steps to see this stunning little village. If you aren't breathless by the time you get there, you will be when you see the little cobbled streets with tiny, but beautiful, houses. We had a meal in the restaurant which was delicious. The",

          "This medieval castle definitely is worth a visit. To reach it, there is an easy route uphill from the Roquebrune-Cap-Martin train station (about 20-30 minutes). On the way you will pass the church (only open limited hours, unfortunately) and the town's war memorial. The",

          "We stayed in this guesthouse for 3 nights and it was a great experience. We loved the surroundings very much, the view from the top of that area was outstanding and the area itself was very posh and inviting. Narrow streets, beautiful restaurants, very french food and of course,",
          "The medieval castle of Roquebrune and the surrounding old village is as beautiful as the nearby, very touristy, Eze village! Native Roquebrunois are thus happy that their village was not discovered so soon, as it is more authentic and not overrun with tourist buses!!!",

          "Really impressive medieval fort sitting on top of a chalky cliff, dominating the hamlet of Roquebrune, lending it its name. Viewable inside and outside, through tortuous stony paths criss-crossing the castle area, which is remarkably lively with small restaurants. Tiny, but",
          "This is a very small chateau. I have to admit that I was quite disappointed since most people made it up to be the highlight of Roquebrune. It did have detailed descriptions of each section of the chateau which were quite informative. The views from the top definitely make up",
          "I was told it was about 500 steps to walk up to the Chateau - actually it was closer to 600. It felt good to do it. The history of the chateau was very informative and the view of the towns was wonderful."

        "wiki": "Monaco ( (listen); French pronunciation: \u200b[m\u0254nako]), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco), is a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France to the north, east and west, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The principality is home to 38,682 residents and is widely recognised for being one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world. The official language is French, although Mon\u00e9gasque, English and Italian are spoken and understood by a sizeable group.With an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe and the second-smallest in the world, after the Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometre (49,230/sq mi), make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world.  Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi), the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires Ward, which is 161 metres (528 feet) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the state border with Italy. Its most populous Quartier is Monte Carlo and the most populous Ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by 20 percent. In 2005, it had an area of only 1.974 km2 (0.762 sq mi).\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small military units.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, Monte Carlo, and a railway connection to Paris. Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no income tax, low business taxes, and is well known for being a tax haven. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.Monaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency (prior to this it used the Mon\u00e9gasque franc). Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004, and is a member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One and birthplace of Scuderia Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, who have become French champions on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (monos) \"alone, single\" + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (oikos) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. \nAccording to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese. \nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia. \nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the Grimaldi family ===\n\nFollowing a land grant from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Il Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks\u2014a monaco in Italian, although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.Francesco, however, was evicted only a few years afterwards by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. However, the Genoese became engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco in a conflict with the Crown of Aragon over Corsica. Aragon eventually became part of Spain, and other parts of the land grant drifted into various pieces of other kingdoms and nations.\n\n\n=== 1400\u20131800 ===\n\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\".The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and it remained under direct French control until 1814, when the Grimaldi family returned to the throne.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nBetween 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon).\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality, and the surrounding county of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. \nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nUntil the Monegasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers. The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\nIn July 1918, the Franco-Monegasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the Monaco Succession Crisis.\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.In September 1943, following the collapse of Mussolini, the German Wehrmacht occupied Monaco and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opera in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was later killed. Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland. In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\nRainier III, who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties.\nIn 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film Grace of Monaco is loosely based on this crisis.In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.On 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.  He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\nFollowing a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily for some desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but called it off.  The plan is for about six hectares of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices for about 1 billion euros for the land.  The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.  There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state. The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government, who presides over a five-member Council of Government. Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monegasque.  On 3 March 2010, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Michel Roger.Under the 1962 constitution, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council. The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation. All legislation requires the approval of the National Council, which is currently dominated by the conservative Rally and Issues for Monaco (REM) party which holds 20 seats. Union Mon\u00e9gasque holds three seats while Renaissance holds one seat. The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council, which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor. Unlike the National Council, councillors are elected for four-year terms, and are strictly non-partisan; however, oppositions inside the council frequently form.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.  Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world. The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.  According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:\nMonaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\nMonte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\nLa Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer,\" and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.\n\nFontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\nMoneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\nLarvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.Subsequently, three additional wards were created:\n\nSaint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\nLa Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\nLes R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time. However, Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the program. In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.\n\n\n==== Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas ====\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille. However, the suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of the Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.\n\n\n==== Wards ====\n\nCurrently Monaco is subdivided into ten wards, with their official numbers; either Fontvieille II or Le Portier would become the effective eleventh ward, if built:\nNote: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States.\nOther possible expansions are Le Portier, a project relaunched in 2012\nAnother possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013\n\n\n=== Security ===\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 36,000 people) and police presences in the world. Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats.There is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the Prince and the palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers), which is equipped with weapons such as M16A2 rifles and 9 mm pistols (Glock 17), and which together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence Corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) forms Monaco's total public forces. The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the Princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the NCOs and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the Carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city state, with five quartiers and ten wards, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice, France.It has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 hectares (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 metres (539 feet) above sea level. The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.Saint-Jean is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 metres; 0.12 miles; 620 feet) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000.00 m2; 1.24 acres; 53,819.55 sq ft) in area. Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.After a recent expansion of Port Hercules, Monaco's total area grew to 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi) or 202 hectares (500 acres); consequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 hectares (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Current land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille. There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille. Monaco's only natural resource is fishing; with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry. There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Epoque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids.  These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.  This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.  In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay. The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate (Cfb) and humid subtropical climate (Cfa). As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 \u00b0C or 86 \u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years. On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742 GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150. It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world. For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casino and pleasant climate.  It has also become a major banking centre, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds. Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics and biothermics.The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.Monaco is not a member of the European Union. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime, however, a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.  All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money. \nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs. \nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\" They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses. In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.\n\n\n=== Taxes ===\nMonaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).\n \nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals, and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.  The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits, unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco.  Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands.  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"Also in 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated. In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven, but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n=== Numismatics ===\n\nOf interest to numismatists, in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the Mon\u00e9gasque franc. In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins. Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins. However, in 2006, the design was changed after the death of ruling Prince Rainier to have the effigy of Prince Albert.Monaco also mints collectors' coins, with face value ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac100. These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the Eurozone. The same practice concerning commemorative coins is exercised by all eurozone countries.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015. Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).Citizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called Mon\u00e9gasque. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is used by American, British, Anglo-Canadian, and Irish residents.\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Christian ===\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.According to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholics are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians.  The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church.  There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholicism ====\n\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution. There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n==== Anglican Communion ====\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925.  In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglicans resident in the principality, but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n==== Reformed Church of Monaco ====\nThere is one Reformed church, located in the Rue Louis Notari.   This church was built in 1958/1959.  It is affiliated to the United Protestant Church of France (Eglise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a grouping that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Eglise Reform\u00e9e de France).  Through its affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Reformed Church of Monaco acts as a host-church to some other Christian communities, in that it allows them to use its Rue Louis Notari building. \n\n\n==== Charismatic Episcopal Church ====\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Christian Fellowship ====\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n==== Greek Orthodoxy ====\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox ====\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo. The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Two-thirds of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other third is Ashkenazi.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents not citizens. The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there are smaller Turkish minorities as well. Monaco does not have any official mosques. There is a mosque in nearby Beausoleil, France, within easy walking distance of Monaco.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\n\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco. It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.The circuit is incredibly narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track. Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1) and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967. Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.Monaco also holds a Grand Prix winner, in the form of Charles Leclerc, who has won two races so far in his career, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix and 2019 Italian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Formula E ===\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix and used a shorter course of the full Formula 1 course, keeping it around Port Hercules.\n\n\n=== Monte Carlo Rally ===\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since. Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1 the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup (1998\u20132012) between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. However, Monaco is one of only two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in France top flight in Basketball LNB Pro A while participating in the EuroCup. They currently have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B(Second tier), one NM1(Third tier) championship. They currently play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin what part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series. The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15-kilometre (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182-kilometre (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.Monaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping). In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25\u201327 June.\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three separate countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9-kilometre (1.2-mile) swim, 90-kilometre (56-mile) bike ride and 21.1-kilometre (13.1-mile) run.\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco. An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.A municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide. The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.With Formula One Monaco GP it has some supporter series, FIA Formula 2 and Porsche Supercup. It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and other Formula Junior programs. \nFrom 10\u201312 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.,The women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\n=== Museums in Monaco ===\n\nMonaco Top Cars Collection\nNapoleon Museum (Monaco)\nOceanographic Museum\n\n\n=== Events, festivals and shows ===\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\nInternational Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\nMondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\nMonte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n=== Bread Festival ===\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on September 17 every year..\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III; one lyc\u00e9e that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er; and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo. There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco, founded in 1994.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language school specializing in business education and operated by the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales (INSEEC) group of schools.\n\n\n== Flag ==\n\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs. Adopted by Monaco on April 4, 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (adopted by Indonesia in August 17, 1945) except for the ratio of height to width.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.\n\n\n== Relations with other countries ==\n\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters. Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union. Monaco shares a 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) border with France but also has about 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea. Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.\nFrance-Monaco relations\nMonaco\u2013United States relations\nMonaco\u2013Russia relationsThere are two embassies in Monaco: those of France and Italy. There are about another 30 or so consulates. By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).In the year 2000 nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners. In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60% However, it is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, which works out to about 100\u2013150 people a year. The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 percent were native Monegasque (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco. Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation. In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country. For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years. In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.There are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentOfficial Government Portal\nOfficial website of the Prince's Palace of Monaco\nChief of State and Cabinet Members\nMonaco Statistics Pocket \u2013 Edition 2014General information\"Monaco\".

          "Beach is nice but the 2 local beach bars charge ridiculously high prices. Examples: 1 beach chair for \u20ac40, simple hamburger and chips for \u20ac35.",
          "Out of peak season with the warm June sunshine breaking through it really is a lovely coastal scenic walk. We started from Cap d'ail making our way to the borders of Monaco. The walk with the high cliffs on one side and the turquoise waters of the sea on the other is",
          "I hesitate to write about Mala Beach because it is one of the best kept secrets on the Riviera. There is a reason it is called Eden Beach. Do the walk, which is splendid, but know that nothing will prepare you for the jaw-dropping beauty that is Eden Beach. Perhaps I am doing a",
          "I was quite surprised to discover that the Mala Beach doesn't look like the paradise picture by a lot of reviews. Even if the private beaches are gone, the space is very narrow, taken by two huge restaurants. Then there are all the boats coming to bring people, the plastic",
          "We( our family of 5) have stayed in the French Riviera many times during the last 15 years. Since we found this fantastic place we always go back. Stunning views... clearest water I've seen in this area! Bring your snorkelling gear!",
          "Fantastic view on the tour down to the beach. It\u2019s not a beach with sand, but with smaller stones. It\u2019s actually ok! The water is clean and very nice. Toilets unfortunately not great, but they are there\ud83d\ude42",
          "I was booked to conduct a wedding on Mala beach and opted to arrive by train. Crossing the train track via the tunnel brought me out onto this path which I'd not expected to be so lovely, made better so by the excellent restaurant where I could sit and enjoy some light",
          "Walked the path after strolling from the cruise dock and really enjoyed the scenery and villa spotting. At Cap d'Ail there are some absolutely stunning villas if you have a spare 15 million or so. Walk took around 1 hrs 45 minutes. We were going to catch the train back to Monaco",
          "There are lots of steep steps leading down to the beach and so I could not bring my whole family here. The beach is shingles and very clean as is the water.",
          "Mala beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. The surrounding scenery is a dreamy one and you will not get enough of taking pictures. Absolutely a must to walk the surrounding path around it! The water is just perfect but you really need special footwear if you",
          "This is a walk that never grows old. The views out over the sea are grand. You will often see many yatchs criss crossing their way back and forth from Monaco. Be very careful during times of high winds as the sea can easily sweep up over the trail and has claimed some lives as a",

          "We were unable to get a taxi from the beach back to our hotel. The hotel was 30 minutes away by foot. The walk had many pretty views of the ocean and even went by Marquet beach.",
          "A lovely beach, with beautiful surroundings and good service. The food is great, but a little bit expensive.",

          "There are quite a few steps up and down, and round each corner the views of the coastline are stunning.",
          "If you have a chance to take a nice long walk along this path its AMAZING! In some spots the waves hit right up along the walking path. I would say its a safe path to walk, but has some tricky spots.",
          "The hardest part of the walk was, like many, trying to locate the actual start! Because of the high buildings and the work going on to prepare for the Grand Prix, finding Marquet Beach, our starting point wasn't all that simple, its not always easy to see landmarks when you're",

          "Gorgeous day, why not take a 2-3km walk to Monaco ? Easily accessible via Francois de May avenue, then via exotic garden. Quite gentle terrain, easy walking, with plenty of benches & stops along the path. Some lovely spots for photo's, or just listening to the surf caressing",
          "The coastal path is a nice easy walk with great views. We were staying at the Marriott and took a late evening walk for about a mile. Great for running and walking.",
          "First never walk this path on a stormy day - it can be treacherous with waves which can scoop you up. But on a sunny day this is a blissful seafront path with views back to Cap Ferrat.",
          "The entire path from Monaco to Mala is an excellent trail along the sea and mountain. The path is used by a large population on weekends. There are several gates which are closed, walkers do go over them, thou it is mentioned not to enter. It was a lovely walk and I enjoyed it.",
          "The beach as can be seen in the photographs is extremely beautiful, and a must visit location if in Nice or Monaco. Out of the 4 or 5 beaches that we have in that region this is certainly the most beautiful. How To Reach - Take the Bus no 100 from either Nice or Monaco, its",
          "I was lucky enough to live in Cap d'ail for a year and visit Mala Beach several times. The mini hike down to Mala Beach is quite the experience. The narrow road winds down the side of the mountain which boarders the french riviera. This road will lead down to some narrow steps",
          "We walked the whole of the path in the early evening. The majority of the walk is right next to the sea. The views are lovely of the sea as well as cliff edges as well as the beaches and villas on the route. If you read French there are lots of signs telling you about the plants",
          "Mala Beach Coastal Path (or Sentier du Littoral de Cap D'Ail) starts at Mala Beach of Cap D'Ail and ends at Marquet Beach near Monaco. Most of the time you'll walk right near the sea with beautiful views of the sea, beaches, hills, and villas. The path is closed at 2-3 places",
          "It's a lovely walk to undertake especially in the early mornings. The views are breathtaking. Super yachts and a billionaires paradise are what you can see. Not much nature. Wear good shoes",

          "You can walk from Monaco to Mala Beach (Cap d'Ail) along the coastal path which is on a man made path in most parts with railings on various parts of the route. The scenery is spellbinding, the path takes you past grand villas and the former home of Greta Garbo.",
          "We took the train from Nice to Monaco and walked back to Cap D'ail along the coastal path, Beautiful landscape, easy walk if you are decently fit. Would recommend,",
          "We took the path from the train station that wound around the Rocky point, the sun was searing, but the waves crashing and spraying felt delightful. As the beach came into view, I knew that this place was utterly perfect. The prominent cliffs give the feeling of isolation, and",
          "It doesn't get much more wonderful than this, the contrasts of the Mediterranean closer as you can ever get. This is a path to enjoy, not to rush! At the other end is the Mala beach lagoon, the loveliest beach in the Nice area in my honest opinion. ( Gets crowded at season peak",
          "Blue sky and blue water with a nice view to JJ Cap Ferrat. There are a couple of private beaches but also plenty of free space for swimmming and taking a sun bath.",
          "beautiful beach , there are 2 private beach there , but make sue to have reservation. the water is blue crystal, so quiet and calm and great view. i loved it .you just have many steps to go up...",
          "The path to the Mala Beach, also called \"Sentier Cap d'Ail\" is a very nice place to stroll with the familly, but you need to be fit, the round trip is 5km, so keep that in mind if you are thinking about bringing children. Take a lot water, because you won't find any until you",
          "I liked the walk and its sea views and from Cap d ail station a train takes you to all stations on the riviera.",
          "The path winds around the coast. Some areas are a little narrow and steep. There are many exits onto nearby streets.",
          "A friend & I took our 6 kids,ages ranged from 15 to 10, on this walk & they loved it. We did it in the evening & it was a beautiful walk along the South of France ! Can be steep but worth it.We started in Monaco at the waterfront & walked all around to the start of the walk &",
          "Fabulous views were delivered as promised, although the coastal path proved how unfit I am! It's quite a steep walk (steps or road/path) from the coastal path into Cap d'Ail!",
          "It's a beautiful walk along this coastal path. I strongly recommend it but beware when the sea is rough - some people have never come back! A must-do in Cap d'Ail!"

        "wiki": "Caroline, Princess of Hanover (Caroline Louise Marguerite Grimaldi; born 23 January 1957), is the eldest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and the American actress Grace Kelly. She is the elder sister of Prince Albert II and Princess St\u00e9phanie. Until the births of her niece and nephew, Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques, in December 2014, she had been heiress presumptive to the throne of Monaco since 2005, a position which she previously held from 1957 to 1958.\nCaroline is married to Ernst August, Prince of Hanover (born 1954), the heir \nto the defunct throne of the former Kingdom of Hanover, as well as the heir male of George III of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Family and early life ==\nCaroline was born on 23 January 1957 in the Prince's Palace, Monaco. She is the eldest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and his wife, former American actress Grace Kelly. Christened Caroline Louise Marguerite, she belongs to the House of Grimaldi. She was the heiress presumptive from her birth to 14 March 1958, when her brother Prince Albert was born. On 1 February 1965, her younger sister Princess St\u00e9phanie was born. Caroline is a legitimate patrilineal descendant of the Dukes of Polignac, and as such belongs to the historical French nobility. Through her mother, she is of Irish and German descent.As a child, she spent some of her time at the home of her maternal grandparents John B. Kelly Sr. and Margaret Major in Philadelphia. In an interview for People in April 1982, shortly before her death, Grace described Caroline and St\u00e9phanie as \"warm, bright, amusing, intelligent and capable girls. They're very much in tune with their era. Besides being good students, they are good athletes \u2013 excellent skiers and swimmers. Both can cook and sew and play the piano and ride a horse. But, above all, my children are good sports, conscious of their position and considerate of others. They are sympathetic to the problems and concerns in the world today.\"Caroline spent the summer of 1971 at Camp Oneka in the Poconos. While there, unbeknownst even to her parents, she was protected by the United States Secret Service.Princess Grace died on 14 September 1982, the day after suffering a stroke while driving her car, as she and Princess St\u00e9phanie were returning home to Monaco from a visit to France; resulting in an accident in which both were injured.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe princess received her French baccalaur\u00e9at in 1974 with honours. She was also educated at St Mary's School Ascot. Caroline continued her studies at the Sorbonne University, where she received a diploma in philosophy and minors in psychology and biology. She is fluent in French, English, Spanish, German and Italian.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nIn 1979, Princess Caroline was appointed by her father as the president of the Monegasque Committee for the International Year of the Child. Two years later, in 1981, she founded her own foundation Jeune J'\u00e9coute. Other philanthropic organizations Caroline has been involved with include the World Association of Children's Friends (AMADE), the Princess Grace Foundation, the Prince Pierre Foundation, the Peter Le Marchant Trust and UNICEF. Her other patronages include the International School of Paris, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, which she also founded, the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Association des Guides et Scouts de Monaco, the Monte Carlo Garden Club and The Spring Arts Festival.\nFollowing her mother's death in 1982, Caroline served as de facto first lady of Monaco until her brother married Charlene Wittstock in 2011. She regularly attends important social events in Monaco related to the Monegasque Princely Family, such as the National Day celebrations, the annual Rose Ball, the Red Cross Ball and the Formula One competition Monaco Grand Prix.\nDue to her commitment to philanthropy and arts, Caroline was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador on 2 December 2003. The UNICEF honoured her with Children's Champion Award on 20 May 2006. The next year, she travelled to the Republic of South Africa to meet its former president Nelson Mandela. In December 2011, the World Association of Children's Friends honoured her for \"tireless endeavours in continuing the organisation's legacy\". Her personal friend and the Chanel head designer Karl Lagerfeld presented her the award. Caroline had also previously been given the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Charles, and had been appointed as the Commander of the Order of Cultural Merit.\n\n\n== Personal and media life ==\nCaroline's personal interests include horseback riding, swimming and skiing. Since her youth, she has been considered an international fashion icon and as one of the best dressed women in the world. In November 2011, an exhibition honouring Princess Caroline was opened at the National Museum of Monaco.Caroline was romantically linked to many famous men, including Mark Shand, the younger brother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; Guillermo Vilas; Sebastian Taylor, who had previously dated Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia; Jonathan Guinness, the son of Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne; Henri Giscard d'Estaing, the son of former President of France Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing; and French singer Philippe Lavil. Following her divorce from Philippe Junot, she was briefly engaged to Robertino Rossellini, the son of Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman. Between her second and third marriages, Caroline had a relationship with French actor Vincent Lindon.\n\n\n=== First marriage ===\nPrincess Caroline's first husband was Philippe Junot (born 19 April 1940), a Parisian banker. They were married civilly in Monaco on 28 June 1978, and religiously on 29 June 1978. Their lavish wedding ceremony was attended by some 65 guests, including Hollywood stars Ava Gardner, Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra.The couple divorced, childless, on 9 October 1980. In 1992, the Roman Catholic Church granted the princess a canonical declaration of nullity.\n\n\n=== Second marriage ===\nHer second husband was Stefano Casiraghi (8 September 1960 \u2013 3 October 1990), the sportsman heir to an Italian industrial fortune. They were married civilly in Monaco on 29 December 1983, and had three children:\n\nAndrea Albert Pierre Casiraghi (born on 8 June 1984 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre in Monaco). Married Tatiana Santo Domingo on 31 August 2013, at the Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville. The couple have three children:\nAlexandre \"Sasha\" Andrea Stefano Casiraghi (born on 21 March 2013 at Portland Hospital in London; entered the line of succession to the Monegasque throne when his parents married).\nIndia Casiraghi (born on 12 April 2015 in London).\nMaximilian Rainier Casiraghi (born on 19 April 2018 in London).\nCharlotte Marie Pomeline Casiraghi (born on 3 August 1986 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre). Has a son with her former partner, the French actor and comedian Gad Elmaleh, and a second son with her husband, the French producer Dimitri Rassam:Rapha\u00ebl Elmaleh (born on 17 December 2013 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).\nBalthazar Rassam (born on 23 October 2018 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).\nPierre Rainier Stefano Casiraghi (born on 5 September 1987 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre). He married Beatrice Borromeo in a civil ceremony on 25 July 2015, in the gardens of the Prince's Palace of Monaco. They have two children:\nStefano Ercole Carlo Casiraghi (born on 28 February 2017 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).\nFrancesco Carlo Albert Casiraghi (born on 21 May 2018 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre).The two younger children are named for their maternal great-grandparents, Princess Charlotte and Prince Pierre, while Andrea was named for a childhood friend of his father's. Stefano Casiraghi was killed in a speed-boating accident in 1990, aged 30 years.\nEven though their parents had not married in the Church, as required for legitimacy under church law, they were legitimised by Pope John Paul II in February 1993, eight months after their mother's marriage to Junot had been annulled in June 1992.\n\n\n=== Third marriage ===\nCaroline's third and current husband is Prince Ernst August of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick, head of the House of Hanover which lost its throne in 1866. From 1913 to 1918, his family ruled the sovereign Duchy of Brunswick.\nThe couple married in Monaco on 23 January 1999. Ernst August had previously divorced his first wife Chantal Hochuli, with whom he had sons Prince Ernst August and Prince Christian, and who had been Caroline's friend.\nThe couple have one daughter together:\n\nPrincess Alexandra Charlotte Ulrike Maryam Virginia of Hanover (born 20 July 1999 in V\u00f6cklabruck, Austria).Her husband's title as Duke of Brunswick is honourific since the ruling family of that state was removed by the Weimar Republic in 1918, along with all royal and noble German ruling families, which were still allowed to retain their titles. Neither she nor her husband has royal rank in Germany, but Monaco recognizes the Hanoverians' former German royal titles, attributing to the couple the style of Royal Highness. On 11 January 1999, shortly before Caroline and Ernst's wedding, his fourth cousin once removed (George III was their common ancestor), Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, issued this Order in Council, \"My Lords, I do hereby declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August Albert of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg and Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite of Monaco...\". As a legitimate male-line descendant of George III, Ernst August was subject to the Royal Marriages Act 1772 (repealed in 2015). Prior to the repeal of the Act, the revised form of which limits those who must gain permission to the first six people in the line of British succession, marrying without the Queen's Royal Assent would have meant their marriage would be void in Britain, where Ernst August's family owned substantial property and he holds (dual) citizenship.Likewise, the Mon\u00e9gasque court officially notified France of Caroline's contemplated marriage to Prince Ernst August and received assurance that there was no objection, in compliance with Article 2 of the 1918 Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty. Despite obtaining the official approval of the governments of France, Monaco and the United Kingdom, upon Caroline's marriage to Ernst August he forfeited his own place in Britain's order of succession. He is also subject to the Act of Settlement 1701, which imposes that consequence upon British dynasts who marry Roman Catholics.In 2009, it was reported that Caroline had separated from Ernst August and returned to live in Monaco.Princess Caroline's residence is the Villa Clos St Pierre in Monaco-ville where she lives with her youngest child, Princess Alexandra.\n\n\n=== Privacy cases ===\nCaroline has had a bad relationship with media and paparazzi since her youth, when she complained she \"could not live the life of a normal student\". On 24 June 2004, the Princess obtained a judgement from the European Court of Human Rights condemning Germany for non-respect of her right to private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.Caroline invoked the judgment in combination with articles 1(1) and 2(1) of the Basic Law (human dignity and personal freedom, respectively) as well as \u00a7 22 of the German Art and Photography Copyright Act or KunstUrhG (no publication of personal images without permission) in a new domestic case, attempting to get the courts to prohibit publication of certain images of her in a private setting. The Supreme Court accepted her claim with regard to two images, but did not prohibit publication of a third, stating that the image accompanied an article about a subject of public interest, which allows publication without permission per \u00a7 23 of the KunstUrhG. Caroline appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court, which affirmed the Supreme Court's judgement. Unsatisfied with this result, Caroline filed a new complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. This time, the court found that the domestic courts had properly weighed the competing interests of Caroline's privacy and the press' right to freedom of expression, and thus found that there had been no violation of Article 8.\n\n\n=== Writings ===\nIn April 1981, the Princess penned an essay, entitled \"Home\" and published in the International Herald Tribune's supplement. The byline was \"Caroline de Grimaldi.\" In the essay, she wrote: \"I long for the Mediterranean ... I feel in my bones that I belong in Monaco.\"\n\n\n== Succession issues ==\nPrincess Caroline was heiress presumptive to the crown of Monaco until the birth of her brother's legitimate children.\nThere is precedent for a Mon\u00e9gasque prince to adopt his own illegitimate child and thereby place that child at the head of the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, as was done for Caroline's grandmother, Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. However, because of changes to the constitution of Monaco in 2002, this was no longer an option.Albert's lack of legitimate children until the 2010s prompted Prince Rainier III to change the constitution so as to ensure there would be a successor to the throne, which strengthened the places of Caroline and her descendants in the line of succession. On 2 April 2002, Monaco passed Princely Law 1.249, which provides that if the Sovereign Prince assumes the throne and then dies without a legitimate direct heir, the throne will pass to his dynastic siblings and their descendants according to the rule of male-preference cognatic primogeniture. The law was then ratified by France, as required by a 1918 Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty, on 4 October 2005. Before this change, the crown of Monaco could pass only to a descendant of the last reigning prince, excluding such collateral relations as siblings, nephews, and nieces.\n\n\n== Titles, styles, honours and arms ==\n\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n23 January 1957 \u2013 14 March 1958: Her Serene Highness The Hereditary Princess of Monaco\n14 March 1958 \u2013  23 January 1999: Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline of Monaco\n23 January 1999 \u2013 6 April 2005: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Hanover\n6 April 2005 \u2013 10 December 2014: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Hanover, and Hereditary Princess of Monaco\n10 December 2014 \u2013 present: Her Royal Highness The Princess of HanoverCaroline is usually referred to and addressed by the female form of the higher style attributed (by tradition) to her husband, i.e. \"Her Royal Highness The Princess of Hanover\", rather than by her own legal but lower title that, until 10 December 2014, was \"Her Serene Highness The Hereditary Princess of Monaco\".

          "The garden with all it's cacti is beautiful and well organized. The cave is an experience but the guide could have told the story and history behind the descovery of the cave, would have been interesting.",
          "We walked up to the gardens from the main area of Monaco, it was hot! It was a nice garden to walk around lots of cactus, also a cave that you can go into on the hour, allow a couple of hours to visit as it is a nice spot. Get the bus up or down as we did on the way back, only",
          "Visted on Sunday mornong - really quiet and a good time to go. Intriguing amount of cactii and rare palnts laid out through a winding garden.Feels a bit like a maze at timesand would benefit from a more clearly defined map.",
          "Very beautiful place and always very good to see such an nice area. Extremely gentle atmosphere around all the green.",
          "While I agree with what has been said about the view, it is beautiful, the same can be had in many places along that coast without paying an admission. Parking is in a public lot a fair way down the hill and will cost you a few Euro. If you REALLY like cactus this is the place",
          "The garden is located on the slope almost above entire city and as such commands quite good views. Other than that, the choice of plants is limited to various kinds of cacti. One point to note, that the garden is absolutely not navigable for the people with walking",
          "This place is just a short 20 minute walk from the train station. Beautiful, hillside views of Monaco while seeing amazing unique cactus. The cost to get in was 7 Euros but since we got there near the end of the day, we paid 5 Euros. Definitely worth the visit while in Monaco.",
          "The views from the top are unbeatable and you can bag a really breathtaking photo down on Monaco port. I can see why people find the wildlife beautiful, but for me it was quite repetitive as I was under the impression there would be more variety of flowers and plants, rather",
          "Great garden interestingly laid out on the side of the hill. There are great views of the rest of the city - great for taking pictures. The grotto was a highlight of the visit, but you have to take a guided tour (which only happens on the hour so try to plan around that if",
          "The cactus in the garden I have never seen before! These are specimen that was cultivated over 130 years old. I have never seen anything that big before. The architecture of the garden is quite unique, built on the mountain slopes of Monaco with excellent views of the port, the",
          "You can take bus no. 2 from Monaco Ville. Entrance is about 7 euros and covers the entrance to the caves and the museum also. You can find here many species of exotic plants and trees, especially cactus. Prepare yourself to descend many stairs. The cave tours start each hours",
          "It is a shame these gardens are less well known! A friend and I went on Saturday night about 2 hours before closing - the day was cooling off and there was no crowd whatsoever. It was practically empty! Most of the plants are cacti and succulents but they are beautiful and many",

          "These gardens are certainly worth a visit, you can combine your entrance fee with other attractions such as the Aquarium which will save you a few euros. The large variety of cacti are worth seeing and the views are perfect for any budding photographers. There is also a small",
          "I love it here. So well kept and beautifully arranged overlooking the sea and Monaco harbour. So peaceful it's a great place to just sit and relax. Wonderful.",
          "This attraction appeals to all types of visitors to Monaco. Jardin Exotique is a short bus ride from the train station unless one prefers to take an uphill walk for about twenty minutes. There`s an entrance fee that allows access to the mountainside garden and later on, to the",
          "This was a great escape from the busier city area of Monaco. It also offered the most amazing views! Fairly cheap attraction to visit but definitely worth a visit!",
          "It was a beautiful garden filled with mostly Cacti. I like Cacti, it was nice to find this plant in this area of Europe. In my mind this is not exotique, but I understand that this may be different for other people. It is not easy to get there by foot. In the map it seems very",
          "Who knew that a beautiful garden in the middle of Monaco could be so relaxing. We took the time to visit this garden during out visit and all enjoyed it a lot. This is a very nice and quiet park that Princess Grace had some part in. It was amazing that even though you could",
          "A Mediterranean garden with plenty of flowers nicely arranged. Have ample benches to sit down and playing areas for kids. Worth a visit after visit to the harbour and the casino.",
          "We hadn't planned to visit this garden but as we were driving into Monaco we spotted the signs and decided to visit. We parked the car in the multi storey next to the garden and the entrance was a short walk down the road. It was all cacti but some amazing species that we hadn't",
          "The garden is well designed with pretty views of the sea and it has a nice gem: a deep cave to explore! You can only descend with a guide (tours every hour, I believe)",
          "The garden is easily accessible from the Monte Carlo Casino- take the Bus No. 2 all the way up to the last stop- Jardin Exotique for 2 euros. Once here, enjoy the stunning landscaped garden leading you to the best breathtaking views of the Monaco !",
          "Finally made it to this garden, incredibly well manicured and laid out. Bit of an incline coming back up, best avoided in the height of summer I imagine. Great spot to escape the high rises, apart from the construction noise from the constantly developing city below. The cave",

          "These gardens were very nice and interested. The views were the best in all of Monaco. Every step we took I wanted to take pictures. We also really enjoyed the cave, a lot of stairs but also a lot of history.",

          "Located on \"the Rock\" as a part of the old town of Monaco, these \"exotic gardens\" are beautiful & well manicured, but it is equally a great place to relax and take in the stunning views. Entry is free.",
          "Nice garden with lots of cactus on top of a hill. Because it is a steep place you will have to climb. There are interesting caves and a small museum, but were closed when we visited. There are wonderful views of Monaco.",
          "We were in Monaco for 2 days and walked through the gardens 3 times. They are absolutely gorgeous and right next to the water. Highly recommend for a unique photo opportunity!",
          "So stunning, astonish. Many kind different of cactus. And more can enjoy the view of City of Monaco. Even on the toilet can see the view of the beautiful Monaco. And don't ever miss the cave!!! So beautiful, magnificent!!!",
          "Everything in Monaco is first class and this is no exception. The park is clean and tidy and neatly clipped. All captions are in English so no problem for me! The cacti are amazing and hang on the side of a cliff giving wonderful views of Monaco and the sea. There is a free",
          "I last visited Jardin Exotique about 15 years ago and as a frequent visitor to Monaco I decided to make a further visit this afternoon.. The gardens are easy to find and can be accessed from the SNCF railway station using the number 2 bus route which criss crosses the",
          "I visited the Jardin Exotique a few times while stayng in Nice. There are a few cote d'azur line (ligne cote d'azur) busses from Rotierre station in Nice up to Monaco, and one of the last stops before getting down the hill to Monte Carlo is the stop for the garden. The ride",
          "Fabulous gardens and the caves within the gardens are a must see. Entry is reasonable and it takes about 1 hr to do the gardens and 1 hour for the caves. Views over Monaco are spectacular. A really nice place to visit",
          "Was here 20 yes ago, went back this year with our children. The caves are still amazing and nice temperature of 18-20 degr, so no need for the pullovers we brought with us. The view over monaco is also great. Ok pricewise.",
          "Visiting Monte Carlo other than the glitz and the glamour, we were told we really should go here. In the price you don't just get the gardens which are lovely and relaxing with amazing views of the whole principality, but you also get the cave tour and the anthropology museum in",
          "The garden themselves are a bit underwhelming, I mean how many cacti can you look at right? Unless you are a botanist or a gardening enthusiast of course... IMO what makes the jardin exotique special is the fact that it is literally terraced directly onto the cliffside which",
          "This garden is superb. Cactae of every kind and size. The collection is just mind-boggling. As a Bonus there's even a cave, with guided tour, which has the slowest growing stalagmites/stalagtites. Very unique attraction, highly recomended. The view over Monaco is also splendid.",
          "Not for the faint of heart, or relatively inactive. This Exotic garden takes a lot of work and physical strength to visit, let alone I can't imagine the workers. The succulents and the cave is great, the views spectacular.",
          "Gardens are lovely, it was rather a sunny day and gets rather warm when the sun is beating down. The cave is worth a visit but lots of steps 600 in total. You need to be fairly active as it takes quite a lot out of you I'm 30 and do lots of walking and struggled probably",
          "The gardens on this site are so beautiful, you take a stroll enjoying the flowers and succulents at every turn. The view across Fontville is also impressive, You finish with a tour of the caves, it's narrow and slippery steps need care but well worth the effort",
          "Go for the views, the garden is just an added bonus. I can't even imagine the logistics of building and maintaining a garden on the side of a cliff, not for those with limited mobility or a fear of heights. If I knew what I know now I wouldn't of wasted any time with the museum",
          "We walked both ways and that was challenging - wouldn't recommend it for everyone. The ticket includes the garden, which is a charming collection of succulents and cacti, terraced down the side of the mountain with amazing sea views. Also included is a visit to the extensive",
          "The views are spectacular from the Jardin, but if the caves aren't open then I'm not sure it's worth the trek (easy by bus, or a heckuva hike up!) or the admission price. We combined tickets with the aquarium and saved a few bucks.",
          "We disembarked from a cruise ship in Hercule Port looking for a taxi to drive us around Monaco. We walked for about 10 minutes towards the main road and a sign which said Taxis. There were none in sight but we were told that the #2 bus would take us to the Exotic Gardens. We'd",
          "We walked to the Exotic Gardens from the train station (uphill, about half-an-hour), which was signposted and easy to find. Bus number 2 goes from the railway station and terminates at the gardens. The gardens are free on Sundays with an entrance charge on other days. The ticket",

          "It's a bit of a trek getting up here but the views are incredible and the greenery is stunning. Nice place to walk around and contemplate on a sunny day.",
          "Great place to take a break between the two attractions. It's rather small and a bit steep at some places, but the view is magnificent and the ambiance relaxing & peaceful.",
          "Beautiful garden with stunning views out over the coast. Well worth the walk up through the village. If you plan on visiting Villa Ephrussi then buy the \u20ac15 combined ticket which is great value!",
          "We took bus no 2 to the last stop to visit the Exotic gardens. A lovely display of cacti from around the world set on a cliff with stunning views of Monaco. We arrived at 4.15pm and meandered around the garden before heading to the 'Grotto' caves which are in the gardens. These",
          "If you plan to go there on foot, be prepared to walk quite a bit upwards. It's worth it though, as you can see many interesting buildings on the way. If you like cacti and are looking for a good view over Monaco-ville and the new part Fontvielle and would like to sit down in a",
          "Once you are in Monaco first of all enjoy this perfect place :) Of course you should visit countless gardens, besides most of them are free of charge! But I highly recommend visiting the most amazing one - Exotic Garden (Jardin Exotique). The cost is not high, and the pleasure",
          "We visited the gardens recently and loved the variety of cacti and succulents growing there. Some of them were really mature and had amazing formations. The ultimate surprise was the \"grotte\" or cave in the limestone cliff. We descended with our guide and saw spectatcular",
          "I don't quite know what we were expecting when we visited the Jardin Exotique. I'm a great fan of botanical gardens, with a mind doubtless conditioned by numberless visits to Kew and Wisley - but the Monaco version was as different from these as can be imagined. It is tucked,",
          "If you want variety and views, then this exotic garden is a great place to visit. I was disappointed by the lack of cafe/dining facilities - but not very surprised after the lacklustre attitude from the staff. Still I wouldn't miss this on your visit, we had a great walk from",
          "I would not try to walk to the gardens from the port; we stopped by on a cruise tour thankfully. High up above Monte Carlo is the Jardin Exotique. The garden contains lots of tropical plant life and had a nice layout that allows you to leisurely stroll through to enjoy",
          "What a lovely, peaceful garden to visit. The sun shone, the sky was blue, views over the old town and port, sea twinkling below, what's not to like. Yes it's hilly, you have to go down to go up as only one entrance at the top of the hill, but No 2 bus drops off right outside,",
          "To enjoy this attraction and Monaco in particular, you need to be a big fan of steps. Not the 90s teen heartthrobs of course, but the means of ascension. Monaco itself, not by design, well partly by design but more by geographical accident is far from the ideal place for those",
          "This is one of my favourite gardens that I have ever visited. It is beautifully laid out with many different types of cacti. The views are amazing as the whole Monaco is in front of you. Very easy to get here on the number 2 bus.",
          "We were here last January. The garden has nice plants and flowers and from the garden you can see beautiful Monaco!",
          "Far exceeded expectations. Even in February the gardens had plenty of colour. The observatory cave is far deeper and more impressive than I expected, though the guide was not especially good. The museum is very small.",
          "There's 3 major attractions here; 1) The exotic garden, which is a series of cactus plants based on a one-way system slope, you have to go down to come back up A LOT of steps, so I would recommend visitors who have limited mobility maybe shy away from this. The exotic garden",
          "Great view and excellent plants and landscapes. Would a visit is you are around, very peaceful place to visit.",
          "We had a spectacular experience visiting this exotic garden, with its huge plants in a nicely designed garden on a steep cliff with a fantastic view of the bay. The cave is less impressive and if you are not in a good condition enough to add over 300 steps to climb back when",
          "My husband and I went to Monaco for our honeymoon in 1977. Jardin Exotique is beautiful and very different. There are so many different types of cacti, small and large. The garden has wide paths but the incline can be moderately steep as you are going up through the different",

          "I don't recommend visiting the garden for those, who are mad about succulent plants and cactus like me:-) Because there is so many incredible plants that you will go crazy and you will want to have all the plants at home! Now, with an objective eye, it is true that the garden is",
          "The exotic Gardens are one of the must do places in Monaco. They are perched right at the top of the hill behind Monaco, which makes the views over the Principality absolutely stunning. The gardens are incredibly well tended and laid out. The range of cacti and succulents is",
          "This is at the end of bus line 2. The other end is the place. Even if not wanting to see the cactus the free view is worth it. The bus ride is also great and takes you through most of the country.",

          "We went to Jardin Exotique as we'd read that the gardens provide a great view over Monaco and they didn't disappoint - everywhere you turn and each level you go to provides for a different and better view from the one before over Monaco and the neighbouring marinas. The gardens",
          "I have never seen a garden like this before. It features plants and trees from all over the world, most of which are from countries you may not ever visit in your life. It gave it a very eerie feel as I walked through all kinds of strange-looking and interesting cactus plants. I",

          "The Jardin Exotique was my favorite attraction in Monaco. Not only are you surrounded by thousands of different plants, flowers and trees, but you also have a wonderful view overlooking the French/Italian/Monacense Riviera, the yachts, the casino, and the city itself. Even if",
          "We came across the gardens by chance by seeing it as a bus destination and we had a day bus pass. The gardens are jammed packed with huge cactii and combine this with the views over the bay it definately is exotic. The ticket also give you acess to a cave. We thought this was",
          "Fair price for entry which includes the visit of the Monaco caves too. Rugged terrain with bridges, waterfalls, benches for relaxing, beautiful photogenic city views, pond with carps, huge cacti. Cave tour each hour, information in german and english too. Impressive underground",
          "Stunning gardens overlooking the other side if Monaco. Interesting plants, sculptures and fountains and even a small kiddies area. Nice to wander through from the Oceanariums to the Palace.",
          "Our daughter in law recommended that we paid the Jardin Exotique and we were really pleased that we took her advice. We took a service bus from the Casino in Monte Carlo and paid about ten euros for the two of us. The Grotto was not open while we were there. The garden is",
          "...maybe my other half would disagree. Towards the end of the day we headed from the base of the Rock, or \"Le Rocher\", up using the many public lifts and stairs until we reached the garden itself before light began to fade. With tall buildings surrounding this walled terrace",
          "Gardens can be a little boring if not done well but this one breaks all the rules of normality..We.took the local bus up through the winding streets of Monte Carlo so also enjoyed seeing how the locals live and some charming architecture. Good views on the way up for FB. The",

          "I would rather call it not the exotic but cacti or succulent garden. But nevertheless I did like it. There were also few ponds in the garden. The largest one was full of exotic fish. When I was looking at the clear water in the pond it felt like the fishes were flying in the",
          "Very nice to visit, but be careful if you have little kids. Was a bit stressed cause my little girl wanted to escape here. I would advise this place with children from 3 years old as soon as they start to undersand the danger. The views on the Prince's palace are fantastic",
          "The garden itself is only \"exotic\" for someone who is not used to cacti and Mediterranean flora. But that's not its main attraction. Firstly, you'll see how amazingly Monaco people utilize their very limited space by building gardens on terraces. It seems small but notice many",
          "I absolutely love gardens. While the Jardin Exotique is well maintained, and has spectacular views over Monaco, the actual plants are mainly cacti and succulents - the plants that I like least. You can walk the majority of the main garden in 30minutes - 1hr, and the views over",
          "If you want to take a breathtaking view of Monaco, this is the right place where to go! I think that succulents from Mexico, Antilles, South and North America etc... take a back seat compared to what you can see from this site. If you're interested in visiting the natural cave,",

          "The gardens are very beautiful and unique, showing a variety of cacti and succulent plants. The tour is quite short but very pleasant, and the views of Monaco are wonderful. There's a stalactite cave in the garden, with a tour inside every hour, that lasts about 40 minutes (and",
          "Despite being very built up and space at a premium in the world's 2nd smallest country, the gardens are a welcome relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of the casinos and big buildings",
          "Very easy to find. Quite reachable because it is at the foot of the cliff, in front of the Cathedral. Can enter as well from the entrance of the Oceanic Museum. Great shots of the harbour and the garden itself. Can find lots of species of succulents and cacti.",
          "Fantastic day out in Monaco. Entrance fee of \u20ac7. Fantastic views of the city & many photo opportunities en route down the cliff. Didn't realise part of your ticket was a cave exploration!!!! Amazing perk. Very interest down there and fun too. We got told off for using my tripod",
          "It definitely paid of to see this garden with the visit of the one of the most warmest caves in the world. About 18 degrees. And view from here is great. You are able to see whole Monaco.",
          "The \"Jardin Exotique\" in Monaco was really one of the nicest places there, since you see funny and interesting plants and also have an awesome view to the old town and the harbor. You can either take the bus there or walk up. We walked and I have to say finding the way was quite",
          "So brilliant! The tour of the caves was the highlight (definitely worth getting a tour - the guide is crazy multilingual and it's included in the entrance fee to the park) but the park is stunning in its own right. Great views of Monaco too. The archeological museum is small and",
          "This was a great place to visit, but high up in Monte Carlo, so it was easier to take a bus there. We did then walk down. It was not too expensive and we got a free coupon book at the information center that saved us money on the tickets. It was a beautiful garden to walk",
          "The path keeps winding you down the cliff, all the while with an incredible view of Monaco and the Mediterranean. The garden was even bigger than we anticipated and some of the plants were huge but there's only so many cacti and succulents you can look at before getting a",
          "This garden is very beautiful. I think it costs around $3 euros to go in? At first it doesn't seem too big but as you continue your way through and down the stairs you realize it is a lot bigger than it seems. You get a really good hillside view of Monaco and the ocean. Great",
          "This visit was our second to the exotic garden and it is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Beautiful plants from around the world set in an idyllic area with tremendous views of the sea. It's a nice place to get away from the voluminous traffic in the area.",
          "A local lady found us lost en route to the Jardin Exotique and kindly walked us most of the way. If you decide to go there do not walk as the signage is typically for drivers not walkers. Take the no.2 bus and walk approx 5 mins up the hill from the last stop. It was 7 euro for",

          "These are really beautiful gardens with spectacular views across Monaco. The caves tour was also a great experience. Having spent 2 days covering every part of Monaco and Monte Carlo this was easily the high point. Would have given 6 stars but inexplicably the venue does not",

          "I must admit this garden was not what I expected as I assumed there would be other exotic flowers and trees here. This garden is all about cacti and there are certainly some very large specimens and some pretty ones. Again it overlooks part of Monaco and has some good views too",
          "We had a free afternoon which we used to escape the hustle & bustle of the city, and explore these gardens. I must admit, my friends & I did not have high hopes. But we were pleasantly surprised... The gardens not only offer panoramic views across Monaco (great photo",

          "The garden is on a cliff above Monaco and offers a stunning view. The cacti are huge and please have your eyes open that you don't run into one. The garden has a lot of stairs which explains why strollers aren't allowed. We found it worth the money.",

          "We loved walking round all the various pathways of cacti and succulents and were impressed at the quality, quantity and variety of species. We waited for the underground guided tour of the Observatory caves and were very pleased that we had done so. 300 steps down and 300 back",
          "I went there by myself to take some pictures on a sunny day. After a week working it was very relaxing. There are some benchs and you can enjoy the views of Monaco. Although it is not free, I recommend this place, specially for couples. It is very romantic. In the summer,",
          "After the roaring of all the super cars and flash designer wear, this is a place to bring you back down to the real world. The gardens are not large and everyone can take a leisurely walk and take in the beautifully kept variety of plants. As there are not very many places of",
          "This isn't a large jardin, but it is very beautiful and one of the worthwhile sights in Monaco...when you are not watching race cars, euro-trash models, and the yachts of the Russian mafia in the harbor!",

          "To be honest, we had not planned to visit the Jardin Exotique, but when our plans fell through and we ended up just exploring on foot, our wandering led to the entrance of the gardens. I don't recommend this approach, however, as the gardens are perched high on the hills. A",

        "wiki": "Albert I (Albert Honor\u00e9 Charles Grimaldi; 13 November 1848 \u2013 26 June 1922) was Prince of Monaco from 10 September 1889 until his death. He devoted much of his life to oceanography, exploration and science. Alongside his expeditions, Albert I made reforms on political, economic and social levels, bestowing a constitution on the principality in 1911.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn on 13 November 1848 in Paris, France, the son of Prince Charles III (1818\u20131889), and Countess Antoinette de M\u00e9rode-Westerloo (1828\u20131864), a Belgian noblewoman, maternal aunt of Donna Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo, Princess della Cisterna, Duchess consort of Aosta and Queen consort of Spain.\nAs a young man, Prince Albert served in the Spanish Navy, during the Franco-Prussian War, he joined the French Navy where he was awarded the Legion of Honor. In addition to his interest in oceanographic studies, Albert had a keen interest in the origins of man and in Paris, he founded the \"Institute for Human Paleontology\" that was responsible for a number of archeological digs. The \"Grimaldi Man\" found in the Baousse-Rousse cave was named in his honour. Albert's intellectual achievements gained him worldwide recognition and in 1909, the British Academy of Science made him a member.\n\n\n== First marriage ==\n\nOn 21 September 1869 at the Ch\u00e2teau de Marchais (which is still in the possession of the Grimaldi family today) in Champagne, Prince Albert was married to Lady Mary Victoria Hamilton (1850\u20131922), of Lanarkshire, Scotland, a daughter of the 11th Duke of Hamilton and his wife, Princess Marie of Baden. The couple met for the first time in August 1869 at a ball hosted by the Emperor and Empress of France; their marriage had been arranged by Albert's grandmother Caroline.\nCaroline had tried to make a match between Albert and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, the first cousin of Queen Victoria, and sought the help of Napol\u00e9on III (Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte) and his wife, Empress Eug\u00e9nie. The Emperor convinced Caroline that Queen Victoria would never allow a relative of hers to marry into a family who were making a living out of gambling. He then suggested Mary, his third cousin and sister of his good friend, the 12th Duke of Hamilton, as a suitable alternative. Mary was a granddaughter of Charles, Grand Duke of Baden and related by blood to the French Imperial family through her maternal grandmother St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais, Emperor Napol\u00e9on I's adopted daughter and second cousin of Napol\u00e9on III's mother, Hortense de Beauharnais. The Hamiltons were well aware of the extent of Monaco's estate, which was no bigger than theirs, but were sufficiently impressed by its status as an independent principality. The couple married at Ch\u00e2teau de Marchais on 21 September 1869.\nWithin a year of their marriage, the couple's only child (Louis) was born, but Mary, from the hills of Scotland, disliked Monaco and everything Mediterranean. While Albert was away fighting in the Franco-Prussian war, she left Monaco permanently. The couple divorced and their marriage was annulled by the Church on 3 January 1880, although a special provision was made by the Vatican to allow Louis to remain legitimate in the eyes of the Church. Civilly, the marriage was dissolved on 28 July 1880 by the Order of Prince Charles III. That same year, the former Princess of Monaco remarried in Florence, Italy, to a Hungarian nobleman, Prince Tassilo Festetics von Tolna.\n\n\n== Accession and second marriage ==\n\nOn 10 September 1889, Albert ascended the throne of Monaco on the death of his father. That same year in Paris, on 30 October, he married the Dowager Duchess de Richelieu, n\u00e9e Marie Alice Heine (1858\u20131925). The American daughter of a New Orleans building contractor of German-Jewish descent, Alice Heine had married the Duc de Richelieu but had been widowed by age 21 and left with a young son, Armand. Her marriage to Prince Albert proved an equal blessing for him and the tiny principality of Monaco, since Alice brought a strong business acumen, well in advance of her youth. Having helped put her husband's principality on a sound financial footing, she would devote her energies to making Monaco one of Europe's great cultural centers, with an opera, theater, and a ballet under the direction of the famed Russian impresario Serge Diaghilev.\nDespite the initial success of the marriage of Prince Albert and Princess Alice, in 1902, they separated legally, without issue, though did not divorce. According to Anne Edwards' book The Grimaldis of Monaco, this was due to the Princess's friendship with the composer Isidore de Lara. By the same token, the courtesan Caroline Otero, La Belle Otero, who had served him as a high class prostitute between 1893 and 1897, recalled Albert fondly in her memoirs and claimed that he was not a virile man and suffered from erection difficulty. Princess Alice had La Belle Otero banned from the principality in 1897 for being seen with her husband.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn March 1910, there were mass protests against his rule. The Monegasque demanded a constitution and a parliament to rein in the absolute monarch or else they would overthrow him and establish a republic. They were dissatisfied about French domination of the principality's politics and economy. There was severe unemployment as the country lacked factories and farmland and the casinos did not allow citizens to work there. On 5 January 1911, Prince Albert I granted Monaco a constitution, but the document had little real meaning in terms of reducing autocratic rule and was soon suspended by the Prince when World War I broke out. Also in 1911, Prince Albert created the Monte Carlo Rally, an automobile race designed to draw tourists to Monaco and the Casino.\nDespite his military service, or perhaps because of it, the Prince became a pacifist, establishing the International Institute of Peace in Monaco as a place to develop a peaceful settlement for conflict through arbitration. In the tension-filled times leading up to World War I, Prince Albert made numerous attempts to dissuade Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II from war.\nWhen war came, Prince Albert could not avoid becoming involved. In one incident, he even wrote personally to the Kaiser in an effort to ameliorate the consequences of Gen. Karl von B\u00fclow's wrath. Without the Prince's intervention, the French villages of Sissonne and Marchais would have been destroyed. In the \"Great War to End All Wars,\" Monaco declared its neutrality, but in fact, provided the Allied forces with hospitals, convalescent centers, and soldiers, including Prince Albert's only son, Louis.\nAlbert died on 26 June 1922 in Paris, France, and was succeeded by his son, Louis II.\n\n\n== Oceanography, paleontology, geography ==\nPrince Albert I of Monaco devoted much of his life to the study of the sea and oceans. At 22 years old, he embarked on a career in the then relatively new science of oceanography. Understanding the importance of the relationship between living creatures and their environment, he devised a number of techniques and instruments for measurement and exploration. Albert I was also the \u201cinstigator and promulgator\u201d of the oceanographic science he contributed to create. He founded the Institut oc\u00e9anographique, Foundation Albert I, Prince of Monaco in 1906, a private foundation recognized of public utility. It has two buildings: The Oceanographic Institute of Paris, now renamed Ocean House, and what became the world-renowned Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. This includes an aquarium, a museum, and a library, with research facilities in Paris.\n\nHe owned four, increasingly impressive research yachts, Hirondelle, Princesse Alice, Princesse Alice II and Hirondelle II. Accompanied by some of the world's leading marine scientists, he travelled the length and breadth of the Mediterranean, making numerous oceanographic studies, maps and charts. In 1896, on an oceanographic survey of the Azores, he discovered the Princess Alice Bank.\n\nFrom an early age, Prince Albert I of Monaco evidenced a strong fascination for the polar regions. In the years 1898-1907 he made four scientific cruises to Svalbard on his yacht Princesse Alice. His efforts are honored by the later naming of Albert I Land on Spitsbergen.\nThe first cruise in the summer of 1898 was an oceanographical and zoological reconnaissance, aimed mainly at adding to the collections of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, for which the construction had just started.\nOn the second expedition, in 1899, the focus was on the hydrography and topography of Raudfjorden, on the north-western tip of Spitsbergen, of which a map was published. His efforts are acknowledged by the later naming of Albert I Land, which comprises the part of Spitsbergen west of Raudfjorden.\nThe third trip, in 1906, meteorology was added to the range of observations and surveys were pursued. The Prince also provided support for two other expeditions, that of the Scotsman, William Bruce, to Prins Karls Forland, and that of the Norwegian, Gunnar Isachsen, to northwestern Spitsbergen. His funding of the latter lead to regular Norwegian scientific expeditions on Svalbard, and in 1928 the foundation of the Norwegian Polar Institute.\nThe Prince's fourth expedition in 1907, was aimed at completing the results from the previous summer. Prince Albert also lent his support, either financially, or through gifts or loans of oceanographic instruments, to numerous Arctic and Antarctic explorers. The same year, he provided funds and support for the foundation of the Friends of the French National Museum of Natural History Society. In 1909 he joined the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie and the British Academy. In 1910 the Prince was the main founder of the Institute of Human Paleontology (Institut de pal\u00e9ontologie humaine) in Paris, close to the Jardin des plantes which is the seat of the French National Museum of Natural History. Finally, he showed a keen interest in environmental protection, especially in Svalbard. This is demonstrated by his responses to a questionnaire that Hugo Conwentz, a German botanist sent him in 1912.\nIn 1918, the US National Academy of Sciences awarded Prince Albert its Alexander Agassiz Medal for his achievements. The Explorers Club elected Albert I to its highest category of membership \u2014 Honorary Member \u2014 in 1921. He was also awarded the Cullum Geographical Medal of the American Geographical Society. Prince Rainier of Monaco and the International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans established the Prince Albert I Medal in the physical and chemical sciences of the oceans in his honor.\n\n\n== Philately ==\nAlbert I constituted a collection of postage stamps that was later continued by Louis II and finally remain part of the postal museum Rainier III created in 1950.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nDecorations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNewspaper clippings about  Albert I, Prince of Monaco in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBW",

          "The plants here are amazing. It is crazy to see plants that I have at home in my living room the size of trees. I get it. The way these plants grow, spread and live in the wild, gives me insight into how amazing they are. This garden has lots of walking and stairs. Don\u2019t walk to",
          "This garden is well set out with fantastic views, but the gardens in Eze are more beautiful and inspiring",
          "One of Monaco's princes more that a century ago established these impressive gardens, featuring plants from all over the world. Well-worth a visit -- and plan on spending several hours.",
          "Walked from train station which was an experience in itself. Monaco has a lot of steps!Once in at a reasonable price it was stunning. A lot of very large Cacti & other plants spread over many levels discovered through various walkways & bridges on cliff side setting. Brilliant",
          "The Jardin Exotique was difficult for us to find. The street signs send you in circles. It would have been nice if there was a tourist bus that took you up there. We came back another day by car with the address and it is right on top of the city. We paid 7.20\u20ac and it was",
          "The most amazing garden of exotic plants, enormous cacti and many other exotic plants are all around you, and the visit is through tiny paths, and steps weaving between the plants. All overlooking the sea and the harbour with amazing views over to France on one side and Italy on",
          "it is amazing that even in such a small country there is place for a botanical garden. but the caverns of stalactites and stalagmites left the greatest impression. Sorry, the system does not allow good quality photos to be uploaded.",
          "Once inside you\u2019ll enjoy one of the best panoramic view of the Old Town Monaco and the harbour. As the entrance ticket includes the cave tour, be aware of the guided tour times. We missed out on the tour as by the time we got to the cave, the next one was in 45 minutes. Variety",
          "Very beautiful garden, impeccably well kept and managed with love and attention to small details, which make it so perfect. Plus, you can enjoy great panoramic views of Monaco as well as a nice picnic place and interesting archeological museum. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t have time",
          "A fantastic garden with an amazing range of exotic plants/cacti and breathtaking views. Cave tour also fascinating and some brilliant stalactite and stalagmite, but note lots of steps. Excellent value for money!",
          "We have been in this garden this month.. A good place to spend one day, also romantic for the couples.",
          "I thought this was one of the best things to do in the area. Amazing rage of cacti etc perched up high on the hill. Note, there are lots of steps up and down, but nothing too difficult. At the bottom there is a grotto which we went in to with a guide. Again lots of steps up and",
          "I really enjoyed my visit here with my friend, and it was absolutely beautiful to see such a wide range of plants and varieties we would never see in the UK. The fact that there's a cave network here also is amazing, and the tour is very much worth waiting for. One problem I",
          "We went to Monte Carlo mostly to enjoy the sight son the bus journey, but Jardine Exotique turned it into an amazing special day. The array of species & maturity of these cacti is absolutely breathtaking- as are the views of MC and the photo opportunities. For garden lovers,",
          "An absolute steal for \u20ac3.80 for a student ticket, with stunning viewpoints and variety of cacti. For me, it was the highlight of my trip to Monaco. Plenty of places to unwind and relax whilst taking in the scenery.",
          "Inexpensive admission fee for hours of meandering. Totally surprised by the assortment of flowers, the size of the property & the array of cacti & the size if the cacti shrubs. The views of Monaco are an added bonus as the garden is on a cliff. Lots of stone staircases or",
          "great variety of cacti plants, amazing views, calm atmosphere, museum and cave included in the price, recommended!",
          "At only \u20ac3.80 (A student ticket), the Jardin Exotique is a superb attraction. From high up among the cacti and succulents this garden provides the best views over the country! Worth the entrance fee for these views alone. As you wonder up and down the winding party\u2019s of the",
          "We spent a fantastic few hours here for my birthday outting whilst holidaying in France. It is such an interesting place and definitely worth visiting. Make sure you do the cave tour, its really worth it!",
          "This was really wonderful. I have never seen such a collection of mature cacti like this before. Many were flowering which is a treat in itself. The gardens are on the hillside and the walkways cleverly engineered to allow easy meandering.",
          "These gardens are at the far upper left of Monaco and reached by the number 6 bus. I had never dreamed that there were so many different varieties of cactus. How the gardens were put together defies belief as the cactusses grow out of the most unusual places and are very",
          "There are more cacti per square metre than I have seen in several visits to Arizona. The ability to walk up and down steps is vital here as the site is situated on the cliff face. Fabulous construction and beautiful flora",
          "This is a fantastic cactus garden with specimens larger than I thought possible with lots of nooks and crannies to soak in the views. Senior rate of 5 euros was appreciated. Free cave tour (believe every hour) which was really worth the time (about 40 mins). Never seen a cave",
          "A 24 travel pass for E5.50 is worth it in hilly Monaco. The no. 2 bus goes to all the main tourist sites including these gardens. The paths are all on the cliff side and although are very much up and down could be used by pushchairs and possibly wheelchairs. Even in February",
          "A must when in Monaco. Easy to reach by bus at the 'top of the country'. The views are spectacular and the exotic plants are beautiful. We did the tour of the caves as well, which is included in the entry price and fascinating. Easy to spend a couple of hours here.",
          "A great variety of trees and plants. All colours can be seen here. Very neat and clean. Great for relaxing evenings or summer hot days!",
          "The garden is ho-hum. There's a few art installations and nice shade to escape a hot day but nothing spectacular. It pales into comparison to the ocean horizon view surrounding it.",
          "Great expositions, great views, plants, cave and museum. We had a really nice time. I think it was worth it.",
          "Wish we had left more time to spend here. Interesting not just for the cliffside walk but overall. We only popped in as we had a little time to kill post visiting the palace and the side street shops. We SHOULD have skipped the shops and spent time here it's lovely with many",
          "My wife is a horticulturist specialising in succulents, so she was keen to visit the gardens.. We went to Monaco on the train from Nice for a day trip. It was pouring when we arrived and we almost turned back to the station. However, we walked up the hill towards the Gardens",
          "This garden is absolutely stunning and my all time favourite places on Earth, beautiful views of Monte Carlo and most impressive and exotic cactuses I\u2019v ever seen in my life, walking though this garden feels heavenly and yet tranquil, it\u2019s very picturesque and if you\u2019re in",
          "We had a most pleasant stroll through these garden admiring the plants and various statues dotted around the Gardens.",
          "if you like cactuses this is the place to be (at Monaco); hundreds of beautiful and many years old cactuses, very impressive and awesome, little hard to get there (up the hill) but there are some elevators which help; within the site you can buy refreshments only from vending",
          "Delightful gardens with interesting sculptures scattered within. As well as the gardens the view over the ocean is superb. Worth a visit",
          "This was the first place we visited in Monaco. It is very high up but worth it. There is a free bus that can take you up the hill (unsure if it\u2019s always free or it was free because it was a Sunday). Entrance was free too - again I think it\u2019s free on a Sunday and we didn\u2019t go",
          "The Jardin Exotique is high up in Monaco, so will take a walk or a bus to arrive, but it is worth it! The entrance fee is approximately \u20ac8. There is so much to see in the gardens & the view of Monaco from above are amazing. On the hour, there is a guided tour of the underground",
          "This garden and its beautiful cacti provide a break from the bustle of the city. Walk around the garden, and stop for a tour of the grotto or at the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology",
          "Keep in mind that the US based cellular providers don't work well or not at all in Monaco, so be prepared to park anywhere near the water and do a nice 30 min climb to the Gardens. It's worth it because on the way you will get many photo opportunities to capture this unusually",
          "As is everything here in Monaco - the gardens and surrounds are fabulous. Saving up now to live here!!",
          "We took the #2 bus here from the Casino area, near the Tourism office. Superb view of Monaco. Must visit. The gardens itself are pretty excellent too. Similar to what you see in Eze Village. The views itself are worth on its own.",
          "Very picturesque tropical gardens, mostly cacti, with windy paths down the steep hillside. You wonder how they built the place back then. Great views of Monaco, and at the bottom there's a grotto cave which is interesting and a welcome cool break on a hot afternoon (it was 33C",
          "We went there in June, while it was not yet hot this year, but it's recommended to bring a hat for the sun anyway. We had a very enjoyable stroll over the various levels. The scenery was particularly breathtaking at the top. We could have easily stayed most of the day, but for",
          "A very nice collection of cactus plants with other exotics spread around and amazing views on Fontvieille and the Rocher/Main harbour of Monaco. If it comes to purely the plants, then the exotic garden of Eze is better, really it is. However the view is equally astonishing and",
          "My girlfriend and I (29 years old) spent 8 hours on foot exploring every crevice of Monaco and this was certainly the highlight (along with the zoo!)",
          "This was my favourite part of my Monaco trip. Beautiful relaxing quiet place. Views are fantastic of the city. It was really hot when we visited but the running water into the fish ponds made me feel cooler and there were lovely shaded benches to sit on.Cacti fasinate me and I",
          "Spend a good two hours here for \u20ac7.20. Some very colourful varieties other than just the 'dry' cactus type plants. Great view points as you walk round for the harbours and city. It's steep in parts mainly reducing levels from the entrance point, so by the end of the tour",
          "We visited the Exotic Garden in June, with 90 degree heat (Fahrenheit). It was HOT. The shade, trees, and breeze were very welcome. We didn't plan to spend much time in the Garden, mostly just walking through it because we were there. We wound up spending almost 2 hours,",
          "Worth a visit butik but prepare for some sweeting if you are visiting during the summertime. Luckely you'll get cooled off Ind the beautiful limestone coves.",
          "I will preface this review by saying that I am completely fascinated by succulent plants. The Exotic Garden in Monaco is the most striking and awe-inspiring garden I have been to in my life. The diversity of species that have been assembled here since 1933 is a thing of beauty.",
          "We based ourselves in Aix en Provence, rented a car and drove to Monaco from Aix. Prior to arriving in Monaco, we made a stop in Eze. By the time we arrived in Monaco, it was a bit after 10 am. There is a parking garage called L'Engelin where we parked. It is literally across",
          "Very nice views, although not of Nice itself which is obscured by a hill. There is a bit of walking up steps, not wheelchair accessable.",
          "Visited on a Saturday, bus to the entrance very easy to get there but quite a hike up and down. Although the slopes are gentle there are lots of stairs to get back up once you have reached the observation area. Not recommended if you struggle with steps. Fantastic selection of",
          "It is a bit of a hike to walk up to the gardens but you can get the bus, the signage is not easy to follow. What and amazing view when you get there! This must be the best view of Monaco . Beautiful cactus gardens , not too big, an hours stroll would do it. You can also visit",
          "The Gardens are not large in area but more than compensates with a stunning location on the cliff-side and the variety of plants. Land for the gardens was acquired in 1912 with design and establishment undertaken over the next 20 years. They were opened in 1933. If you are a",
          "Loved every zigzag corner with succulents that must be at least \ud83d\udcaf years old. Exceeded my expectations. If you are fit take the lifts and stairs. The views are well worth it. Take in all the expensive Realestate for free. If you need a lotto win to live here it\u2019s still not",
          "We were part of a group visiting the famous gardens of the Cote d'Azur and this garden epitomises all that has made the Cote d'Azur famous for its gardens. It is well laid out and maintained and features many mature and stunning plants. As with most of the gardens we visited",
          "The exotice garden at Monaco is situated in the upper area of the town and therefore has several interestings views over the town of Monaco and of course many, bvery interesting succulent plants. Yo\u00fa can get a discount of 1,70 \u20ac when presenting the coupon from the booklet",
          "Gorgeous views, can take about an hour to get around and the views are well worth it Can take either the number 2 bus or walk up the hill",
          "We had been to Monaco before, but this was the first time we had been to these gardens. They are in the top corner of Monaco, and are quite large and well maintained. They are on the side of a hill, and you have to be reasonably fit and mobile to visit them. It is worth visiting",
          "I didn\u2019t find the garden itself very nice, because as the name says it\u2019s full of exotic plants and I prefer the normal colourful ones - if you are interested in plants I\u2019m sure you will love it - but the view from there is the best in Monaco. I think the ticket is around \u20ac8,00",
          "I highly recommend going to this garden if you end up in Monaco. It\u2019s beautiful and interesting with the cacti. It\u2019s a nice contrast to the ritzy feel of Monaco. I give the garden five stars. The garden admission includes the price of an expert tour for some fascinating caves.",
          "A stunning garden above Monaco on the mountainside with a heavenly view: you feel like you are in the paradise! The entrance fee is only \u20ac7.20 which grants you access to visit the maze of the beautiful exotic garden, the anthropology museum and an amazing extra: a prehistoric",
          "This garden exceeded my expectations, precisely because I love cacti and succulents. Truly a beautiful place with amazing views of the city. It is a steep climb up a mountain which we chose to do on foot, erroneously thinking we were \u201calmost there.\u201d If you can, take the bus.",
          "I just loved this garden, enjoyed the walk, the caves, the picture spots, the view and i would definitely recommend for some nice walk and best memory pics.",
          "This is a beautiful garden and well designed has a various of cactus with their stories . This beautiful place also has a cave which is really beautiful and interesting . A museum of prehistoric anthropology. The guided tour was really good , he took his time to explain",
          "First of all, the simplest way to get there is to take a No.2 bus from outside the tourist office. The cost is currently 2 euros if you pay on the bus or 1.5 euros if you buy a ticket from the machine. Walking up there is too exhausting and you're likely to arrive in a bad mood",
          "Gosh, there are so many cacti here. There's an interesting mix of flora here, and even a small anthropological museum, and ultimately, you definitely have to come here, even if just for the stunning views of Monaco and La Condamine that the garden gives.",
          "The basic 10-euro (Dec. 2017) ticket entitles you to a visit to the garden, the Observatory cave and the Anthropology museum. A 16-euro combination ticket lets you visit the Oceanographic museum as well (located in a different part of town). The Exotic Garden is tough to reach",
          "Didnt have much time to explore the whole garden coz we arrived late afternoon and they close at 5pm. However from the garden you already have a magnificent view of the whole city and the Prince's Palace . Best time to go is in the afternoon with the sunset . Plants are really",
          "In my opinion, without the cave tour the garden tour would have been a failure. This is also the reason I give it 3 stars. Otherwise I would give it 2 stars. The garden tour is not guided, you just walk through the plants. There are very little to no information regarding the",
          "Nice view of Monaco, full of cactuses, fun to walk around...best to get there by a lot of elevator in different places. Worth it. Price included in Riviera pass.",
          "We visited the garden quite early on a Saturday (10.00) it was good timing we arrived before the crowds. This garden is beautifully designed and maintained with cacti and similar plants from around the world as well as beautiful sculptures. There are places to rest and a much",
          "Gardens are great all different cacti. The guide who took us down the cave was very informative. Very easy to walk round great for wheel chairs.",
          "This is my second visit, although for purposes of photography it is great and for views its stunning, there only seems to be plentiful of cactus types of plantation abd maybe a few of floral, would have prefered more variation of floral blooms, the cave tour was only in French",
          "You can access these gardens by stairs from the harbour with a climb and buildings reminiscent of Hong Kong only cleaner and better maintained. The views on the way up are magnificent as they are from the cactus gardens . The tours for the cave are included and went on the hour",
          "The garden with all it's cacti is beautiful and well organized. The cave is an experience but the guide could have told the story and history behind the descovery of the cave, would have been interesting.",
          "We walked up to the gardens from the main area of Monaco, it was hot! It was a nice garden to walk around lots of cactus, also a cave that you can go into on the hour, allow a couple of hours to visit as it is a nice spot. Get the bus up or down as we did on the way back, only",
          "Visted on Sunday mornong - really quiet and a good time to go. Intriguing amount of cactii and rare palnts laid out through a winding garden.Feels a bit like a maze at timesand would benefit from a more clearly defined map.",
          "Very beautiful place and always very good to see such an nice area. Extremely gentle atmosphere around all the green.",
          "While I agree with what has been said about the view, it is beautiful, the same can be had in many places along that coast without paying an admission. Parking is in a public lot a fair way down the hill and will cost you a few Euro. If you REALLY like cactus this is the place",
          "The garden is located on the slope almost above entire city and as such commands quite good views. Other than that, the choice of plants is limited to various kinds of cacti. One point to note, that the garden is absolutely not navigable for the people with walking",
          "This place is just a short 20 minute walk from the train station. Beautiful, hillside views of Monaco while seeing amazing unique cactus. The cost to get in was 7 Euros but since we got there near the end of the day, we paid 5 Euros. Definitely worth the visit while in Monaco.",
          "The views from the top are unbeatable and you can bag a really breathtaking photo down on Monaco port. I can see why people find the wildlife beautiful, but for me it was quite repetitive as I was under the impression there would be more variety of flowers and plants, rather",
          "Great garden interestingly laid out on the side of the hill. There are great views of the rest of the city - great for taking pictures. The grotto was a highlight of the visit, but you have to take a guided tour (which only happens on the hour so try to plan around that if",
          "The cactus in the garden I have never seen before! These are specimen that was cultivated over 130 years old. I have never seen anything that big before. The architecture of the garden is quite unique, built on the mountain slopes of Monaco with excellent views of the port, the",
          "You can take bus no. 2 from Monaco Ville. Entrance is about 7 euros and covers the entrance to the caves and the museum also. You can find here many species of exotic plants and trees, especially cactus. Prepare yourself to descend many stairs. The cave tours start each hours",
          "It is a shame these gardens are less well known! A friend and I went on Saturday night about 2 hours before closing - the day was cooling off and there was no crowd whatsoever. It was practically empty! Most of the plants are cacti and succulents but they are beautiful and many",
          "We caught a cab to the palace and walked down through the exotic garden. An absolute must on your visit to Monaco. The atmosphere is peaceful and the views spectacular and on another level \ud83d\udc9a",
          "This is a beautiful but small garden. It's great for a hour or to relax after a full day of Monaco and before you start to drive back.",
          "These gardens are certainly worth a visit, you can combine your entrance fee with other attractions such as the Aquarium which will save you a few euros. The large variety of cacti are worth seeing and the views are perfect for any budding photographers. There is also a small",
          "I love it here. So well kept and beautifully arranged overlooking the sea and Monaco harbour. So peaceful it's a great place to just sit and relax. Wonderful.",
          "This attraction appeals to all types of visitors to Monaco. Jardin Exotique is a short bus ride from the train station unless one prefers to take an uphill walk for about twenty minutes. There`s an entrance fee that allows access to the mountainside garden and later on, to the",
          "This was a great escape from the busier city area of Monaco. It also offered the most amazing views! Fairly cheap attraction to visit but definitely worth a visit!",
          "It was a beautiful garden filled with mostly Cacti. I like Cacti, it was nice to find this plant in this area of Europe. In my mind this is not exotique, but I understand that this may be different for other people. It is not easy to get there by foot. In the map it seems very",
          "Who knew that a beautiful garden in the middle of Monaco could be so relaxing. We took the time to visit this garden during out visit and all enjoyed it a lot. This is a very nice and quiet park that Princess Grace had some part in. It was amazing that even though you could",
          "A Mediterranean garden with plenty of flowers nicely arranged. Have ample benches to sit down and playing areas for kids. Worth a visit after visit to the harbour and the casino.",
          "We hadn't planned to visit this garden but as we were driving into Monaco we spotted the signs and decided to visit. We parked the car in the multi storey next to the garden and the entrance was a short walk down the road. It was all cacti but some amazing species that we hadn't",
          "The garden is well designed with pretty views of the sea and it has a nice gem: a deep cave to explore! You can only descend with a guide (tours every hour, I believe)",
          "The garden is easily accessible from the Monte Carlo Casino- take the Bus No. 2 all the way up to the last stop- Jardin Exotique for 2 euros. Once here, enjoy the stunning landscaped garden leading you to the best breathtaking views of the Monaco !",
          "Finally made it to this garden, incredibly well manicured and laid out. Bit of an incline coming back up, best avoided in the height of summer I imagine. Great spot to escape the high rises, apart from the construction noise from the constantly developing city below. The cave",
          "Nice views, beautiful exposition, relaxing and ambient place. Suggest to organize a small picnic there.",

          "These gardens were very nice and interested. The views were the best in all of Monaco. Every step we took I wanted to take pictures. We also really enjoyed the cave, a lot of stairs but also a lot of history.",
          "This garden is set ot top of La Condamine, above the Cemetery and the Princess Grace Hospital. One can get their either bu Monaco bus or by taking many steps and several lifts. No matter how you get there, you will be amazed of the magnificent garden, laid out on several",
          "Located on \"the Rock\" as a part of the old town of Monaco, these \"exotic gardens\" are beautiful & well manicured, but it is equally a great place to relax and take in the stunning views. Entry is free.",
          "Nice garden with lots of cactus on top of a hill. Because it is a steep place you will have to climb. There are interesting caves and a small museum, but were closed when we visited. There are wonderful views of Monaco.",
          "We were in Monaco for 2 days and walked through the gardens 3 times. They are absolutely gorgeous and right next to the water. Highly recommend for a unique photo opportunity!",
          "So stunning, astonish. Many kind different of cactus. And more can enjoy the view of City of Monaco. Even on the toilet can see the view of the beautiful Monaco. And don't ever miss the cave!!! So beautiful, magnificent!!!",
          "Everything in Monaco is first class and this is no exception. The park is clean and tidy and neatly clipped. All captions are in English so no problem for me! The cacti are amazing and hang on the side of a cliff giving wonderful views of Monaco and the sea. There is a free",
          "I last visited Jardin Exotique about 15 years ago and as a frequent visitor to Monaco I decided to make a further visit this afternoon.. The gardens are easy to find and can be accessed from the SNCF railway station using the number 2 bus route which criss crosses the",
          "I visited the Jardin Exotique a few times while stayng in Nice. There are a few cote d'azur line (ligne cote d'azur) busses from Rotierre station in Nice up to Monaco, and one of the last stops before getting down the hill to Monte Carlo is the stop for the garden. The ride",
          "Fabulous gardens and the caves within the gardens are a must see. Entry is reasonable and it takes about 1 hr to do the gardens and 1 hour for the caves. Views over Monaco are spectacular. A really nice place to visit",
          "Was here 20 yes ago, went back this year with our children. The caves are still amazing and nice temperature of 18-20 degr, so no need for the pullovers we brought with us. The view over monaco is also great. Ok pricewise.",
          "Visiting Monte Carlo other than the glitz and the glamour, we were told we really should go here. In the price you don't just get the gardens which are lovely and relaxing with amazing views of the whole principality, but you also get the cave tour and the anthropology museum in",
          "The garden themselves are a bit underwhelming, I mean how many cacti can you look at right? Unless you are a botanist or a gardening enthusiast of course... IMO what makes the jardin exotique special is the fact that it is literally terraced directly onto the cliffside which",
          "This garden is superb. Cactae of every kind and size. The collection is just mind-boggling. As a Bonus there's even a cave, with guided tour, which has the slowest growing stalagmites/stalagtites. Very unique attraction, highly recomended. The view over Monaco is also splendid.",
          "Not for the faint of heart, or relatively inactive. This Exotic garden takes a lot of work and physical strength to visit, let alone I can't imagine the workers. The succulents and the cave is great, the views spectacular.",
          "Gardens are lovely, it was rather a sunny day and gets rather warm when the sun is beating down. The cave is worth a visit but lots of steps 600 in total. You need to be fairly active as it takes quite a lot out of you I'm 30 and do lots of walking and struggled probably",
          "The gardens on this site are so beautiful, you take a stroll enjoying the flowers and succulents at every turn. The view across Fontville is also impressive, You finish with a tour of the caves, it's narrow and slippery steps need care but well worth the effort",
          "Go for the views, the garden is just an added bonus. I can't even imagine the logistics of building and maintaining a garden on the side of a cliff, not for those with limited mobility or a fear of heights. If I knew what I know now I wouldn't of wasted any time with the museum",
          "We walked both ways and that was challenging - wouldn't recommend it for everyone. The ticket includes the garden, which is a charming collection of succulents and cacti, terraced down the side of the mountain with amazing sea views. Also included is a visit to the extensive",
          "The views are spectacular from the Jardin, but if the caves aren't open then I'm not sure it's worth the trek (easy by bus, or a heckuva hike up!) or the admission price. We combined tickets with the aquarium and saved a few bucks.",
          "We disembarked from a cruise ship in Hercule Port looking for a taxi to drive us around Monaco. We walked for about 10 minutes towards the main road and a sign which said Taxis. There were none in sight but we were told that the #2 bus would take us to the Exotic Gardens. We'd",
          "We walked to the Exotic Gardens from the train station (uphill, about half-an-hour), which was signposted and easy to find. Bus number 2 goes from the railway station and terminates at the gardens. The gardens are free on Sundays with an entrance charge on other days. The ticket",

          "If you plan to go there on foot, be prepared to walk quite a bit upwards. It's worth it though, as you can see many interesting buildings on the way. If you like cacti and are looking for a good view over Monaco-ville and the new part Fontvielle and would like to sit down in a",
          "Once you are in Monaco first of all enjoy this perfect place :) Of course you should visit countless gardens, besides most of them are free of charge! But I highly recommend visiting the most amazing one - Exotic Garden (Jardin Exotique). The cost is not high, and the pleasure",

          "I don't quite know what we were expecting when we visited the Jardin Exotique. I'm a great fan of botanical gardens, with a mind doubtless conditioned by numberless visits to Kew and Wisley - but the Monaco version was as different from these as can be imagined. It is tucked,",
          "If you want variety and views, then this exotic garden is a great place to visit. I was disappointed by the lack of cafe/dining facilities - but not very surprised after the lacklustre attitude from the staff. Still I wouldn't miss this on your visit, we had a great walk from",
          "I would not try to walk to the gardens from the port; we stopped by on a cruise tour thankfully. High up above Monte Carlo is the Jardin Exotique. The garden contains lots of tropical plant life and had a nice layout that allows you to leisurely stroll through to enjoy",
          "What a lovely, peaceful garden to visit. The sun shone, the sky was blue, views over the old town and port, sea twinkling below, what's not to like. Yes it's hilly, you have to go down to go up as only one entrance at the top of the hill, but No 2 bus drops off right outside,",
          "To enjoy this attraction and Monaco in particular, you need to be a big fan of steps. Not the 90s teen heartthrobs of course, but the means of ascension. Monaco itself, not by design, well partly by design but more by geographical accident is far from the ideal place for those",
          "This is one of my favourite gardens that I have ever visited. It is beautifully laid out with many different types of cacti. The views are amazing as the whole Monaco is in front of you. Very easy to get here on the number 2 bus.",
          "We were here last January. The garden has nice plants and flowers and from the garden you can see beautiful Monaco!",
          "Far exceeded expectations. Even in February the gardens had plenty of colour. The observatory cave is far deeper and more impressive than I expected, though the guide was not especially good. The museum is very small.",
          "There's 3 major attractions here; 1) The exotic garden, which is a series of cactus plants based on a one-way system slope, you have to go down to come back up A LOT of steps, so I would recommend visitors who have limited mobility maybe shy away from this. The exotic garden",

          "We had a spectacular experience visiting this exotic garden, with its huge plants in a nicely designed garden on a steep cliff with a fantastic view of the bay. The cave is less impressive and if you are not in a good condition enough to add over 300 steps to climb back when",
          "My husband and I went to Monaco for our honeymoon in 1977. Jardin Exotique is beautiful and very different. There are so many different types of cacti, small and large. The garden has wide paths but the incline can be moderately steep as you are going up through the different",

          "I don't recommend visiting the garden for those, who are mad about succulent plants and cactus like me:-) Because there is so many incredible plants that you will go crazy and you will want to have all the plants at home! Now, with an objective eye, it is true that the garden is",
          "The exotic Gardens are one of the must do places in Monaco. They are perched right at the top of the hill behind Monaco, which makes the views over the Principality absolutely stunning. The gardens are incredibly well tended and laid out. The range of cacti and succulents is",
          "This is at the end of bus line 2. The other end is the place. Even if not wanting to see the cactus the free view is worth it. The bus ride is also great and takes you through most of the country.",

          "I enjoyed the cacti, and le jardin is truly beautiful, built on a hillside and well laid out. For those who have mobility issues, this is not the place for you! However, I think I enjoyed the views of Monte Carlo, the palace, and the Mediterranean more than the cacti. It was",

          "Reasonably interesting to visit. Expect to do climbing uphill. View of Monaco is nice from there. There is a cave but the guide who takes you down there does not speak English and does not stop for you to catch up with him, and It is quite slippery in there so not really safe",
          "To be honest, we had not planned to visit the Jardin Exotique, but when our plans fell through and we ended up just exploring on foot, our wandering led to the entrance of the gardens. I don't recommend this approach, however, as the gardens are perched high on the hills. A",
          "Very old cactus will amaze the cactus enthusiasts and if you are not, the views are stunning! Well worth the 5 euro entrance fee as there are informative plaques dotted around and you know you are standing on the site where people were looking out for invaders centuries ago.",
          "We took the train from Nice to Monaco. In the train station, you can begin following the signs to the botanical gardens, and then you will \"surface\" pretty high up in the hills (after having taken quite a few escalators), leaving approximately a 15 minute walk to the garden",
          "It's hard to impress this jaded garden lover, as I have been to so many across the world. However, this little gem in Monaco had me thrilled to the marrow. Somebody with a lot of money and a love for cacti managed to build this essentially on the side of a cliff, with fabulous",

        "wiki": "The Monte Carlo Rally or Rallye Monte Carlo (officially Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo) is a rallying event organised each year by the Automobile Club de Monaco which also organises the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix and the Rallye Monte-Carlo Historique. The rally now takes place along the French Riviera in the Principality of Monaco and southeast France. Previously, competitors would set off from all four corners of Europe and 'rally', in other words, meet, in Monaco to celebrate the end of a unique event. From its inception in 1911 by Prince Albert I it was an important means of demonstrating improvements and innovations to automobiles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1911 beginnings and controversy ===\nIn 1909 the Automobile Club de Monaco (Sport Automobile Velocip\u00e9dique Mon\u00e9gasque) started planning a car rally at the behest of Albert I, Prince of Monaco. The Monte Carlo Rally was to start at points all over Europe and converge on Monte Carlo. In January 1911 23 cars set out from 11 different locations and Henri Rougier was among the nine who left Paris to cover a 1,020 kilometres (634 mi) route. The event was won by Rougier in a Turcat-M\u00e9ry 25 Hp. The rally comprised both driving and then somewhat arbitrary judging based on the elegance of the car, passenger comfort and the condition in which it arrived in the principality. The outcry of scandal when the results were published changed nothing, so Rougier was proclaimed the first winner.\n\n\n=== 1966 controversy ===\nThe 1966 event was the most controversial in the history of the Rally. The first four finishers, driving three Mini-Coopers, Timo M\u00e4kinen, Rauno Aaltonen and Paddy Hopkirk, and Roger Clark's 4th-placed Ford Cortina were all disqualified because they used non-dipping single filament quartz iodine bulbs in their headlamps, in place of the standard double filament dipping glass bulbs, which are fitted to the series production version of each models sold to the public. This elevated Pauli Toivonen (Citro\u00ebn ID) into first place overall. Rosemary Smith (Hillman Imp) was also disqualified from sixth place, after winning the Coupe des Dames, the ladies' class. In all, ten cars were disqualified. Teams threatened to boycott the event. The headline in Motor Sport read \"The Monte Carlo Fiasco.\"\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nFrom 1973 to 2008 the rally was held in January as the first event of the FIA World Rally Championship, but between 2009 to 2011 it has been the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) programme, a championship for N/A 4WD cars, before returning to the WRC championship season again in 2012. As recently as 1991, competitors were able to choose their starting points from approximately five venues roughly equidistant from Monte Carlo (one of Monaco's administrative areas) itself.\nWith often varying conditions at each starting point (typically comprising dry tarmac, wet tarmac, snow, and ice, sometimes all in a single stage of the rally), this event places a big emphasis on tyre choices, as a driver has to balance the need for grip on ice and snow with the need for grip on dry tarmac. For the driver, this is often a difficult choice as the tyres that work well on snow and ice normally perform badly on dry tarmac.\nThe Automobile Club de Monaco confirmed on 19 July 2010 that the 79th Monte-Carlo Rally would form the opening round of the new Intercontinental Rally Challenge season. To mark the centenary event, the Automobile Club de Monaco has also confirmed that Glasgow, Barcelona, Warsaw and Marrakesh have been selected as start points for the rally.\n\n\n== Col de Turini ==\nThis rally features one of the most famous special stages in the world. The stage is run from La Boll\u00e8ne-V\u00e9subie to Sospel, or the other way around, over a steep and tight mountain road with many hairpin turns. On this 31km route it passes over the Col de Turini, a mountain pass road which normally has ice and/or snow on sections of it at that time of the year. Spectators also throw snow on the road\u2014in 2005, Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm and Petter Solberg both ripped a wheel off their cars when they skidded on snow probably placed there by spectators, and crashed into a wall. Gr\u00f6nholm went on to finish fifth, but Solberg was forced to retire as the damage to his car was extensive. In the same event, S\u00e9bastien Loeb set one of the fastest times in the modern era, with 21 minutes 40 seconds.\nSospel has an elevation of 479m, and the D70 has a maximum elevation of 1603m, for an average gradient of 6.7%. The Turini is also driven at night, with thousands of fans watching the \"Night of Turini\", also known as the \"Night of the Long Knives\" due to the strong high beam lights cutting through the night. In the 2007 edition of the rally, the Turini was not used, but it returned for the 2008 route. For both the 2009 and 2010 event the stage was run at night and shown live on Eurosport.\n\n\n== Past winners ==\n(list by driver / co-driver and vehicle type)\n\n\n=== 1911\u20131972 ===\n\n\n=== 1973\u20131985 ===\n\n\n=== 1986\u20131999 ===\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132009 ===\n\n\n=== 2010\u20132019 ===\n\n\n=== 2020\u2013 ===\n\u2020 \u2013 Event was shortened after stages were cancelled.\n\n\n=== Multiple winners ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonte Carlo or Bust!\nHerbie Goes to Monte Carlo\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "The only reason Jimmy'z is busy is for the lack of other choices in Monte-Carlo. We were there for the season-closing party. Music was terrible - at least half of it not danceable. The dance-floor is very small, and was crowded, even though the place was not full. You can see",
          "Jimmyz was incredible fun, we went for a once in a lifetime experience! We had a table (there were 9 of us) , set next to the \"lake\", table service was flawless and the music was great. Cristal was 800 EUR a bottle and I think we paid something like 300 EUR for bottles of Grey",
          "Ok after the initial shock of a shot of sambuca \u20ac57 each! Dom P \u20ac450 ..We threw in the towel and knew it was going to be an expensive night! 2 females we managed to spend nearly \u20ac800 between us but we did love it, we partied in the DJ booth with boy George and co brilliant night",
          "The view was spectacular at night. The food incredible! We ate here 2 times as it was also very close to the hotel.",
          "Ok it's not a bad club and it has all the glamour of Monaco but sometimes you feel that you are being robbed and that is the way I felt at Jimmy'z...25 euros for a half pint bottle of Heineken is just ridiculous",
          "We werent impressed by the club at all. There are a lot of very young people drinking as if there is no tomorrow and behaving in the same way. One would think high prices select well educated people but this doesnt seem to be the case here. It is more for young boys and girls",
          "Great place indeed, easy to access, packed with nice people and fantasic music and yes, it is possible to get a drink as well. I recommend this place if you are visiting Monaco.",
          "It maybe one of the most famous clubs in Europe and as much as music and environment concerns, the rumor is confirmed. But to my taste there are better places, even in Monaco to party, less expensive and less boring. The majority of those who really party are professionals",
          "To start with: this is the new \" winter-time\" JIMMY'Z, that opened almost a year before, next to the Casino ( the local friends told me that it used to be another club there, before). For those who knows it, the JIMMY'Z is one of the world's legendary night clubs for more than",
          "My daughter and I danced the night away to the amazing DJ -- I loved the outside area to get some fresh air -after dancing - great smiles and the light systems -- they did a small tribute to Donna Summers which was fab--even the bouncers and the bartenders were cool --",
          "We visited the bar on a Friday night last week. Me being a red blooded male decided to chat to a few very attractive ladies only to find that the entire club seemed to be full of hookers at \u20ac1000 euros each, the more i looked round and chatted the more their seemed, not a nice",
          "Dont go before 1 30. It gets packed late even on weekdays. Not bad but overly expensive. One drink is 27euros. Music was good but surprisingly not the latest hits. Ull find all ages in the club.",
          "After Buddha Bar we searched for something better, Jimmy's definitely is not. It's a place for spoiled bragging boys with big cars. Not really friendly staff, and very expensive.",
          "My husband and I went to Jimmy Z and were disappointed. First of all it was ridiculously expensive and we nevertheless ordered champaign to be able to sit at a table. Otherwise you can't sit down. Single drinks were around $40 dollars. Our champaign cost $300. The music was",
          "What a truly awful, revolting dungeon of despair. Magnums of Grey Goose at a few thousand Euro, the rich, overweight and old, awful music, doorman who think the quaint NY 1980s concept of rudeness x thick necks is somehow cool. We had one drink (35 Euros per G+T, yes 70 Euros",
          "Just really disappointing - ordinary wedding reception DJ - lots of young girls playing at being very grown up and old guys throwing their money about. Price-wise \u00a326 for a bottle of Corona. Didn't bother staying long enough to order a drink - no table service unless spending",
          "The place is obviously at a nice location and the atmosphere feels really nice when you enter. But the club had a few flaws I like to point out: first of all, the waiters were arrogant, which shouldn't be the case for a location like this. Second of all the prices are too high",
          "Ok, you must know, before entering such an establishment, you better have one of two things, A. A VERY large bank account, or B. Accompany someone close to the owner. I have to say my chance at glory was with B. Well, at the door, they didn't want to let me in, as for",
          "Well, we all heard the buzz about this place. The deco was nothing special. I would send the waiters to service boot camp. We had three tables and several bottles but seems like they know nothing about \"service\". They might be spoiled by those people who pays so much for",
          "This is definitely a hot spot to check out for ALL ages...I ended up getting into a night when Laurent Wolf was DJ'ing even though we didn't have any reservations and weren't on the list, we were ushered in. This is definitely going to be hard on your wallet as bottle",
          "Walking into the most reputed club of Monaco, a principality known for its extravagance, my hopes and expectations were obviously very high. However, within an hour I realized going into Jimmy'z with any expectations whatsoever was probably a mistake in itself. Having reserved a",
          "I was there last night and asked for my bottle of vodka that I had left there a few weeks before. Low and behold they had lost it. They even tried to claim that actually maybe I was mistaken and that I had actually not left a bottle! After 20 minutes of conversation (with the",

        "wiki": "The French Riviera (known in French as the C\u00f4te d'Azur, [kot da\u02c8zy\u0281]; Occitan: C\u00f2sta d'Azur [\u02c8k\u0254st\u0254 da\u02c8zy\u027e]; literal translation \"Azure Coast\") is the Mediterranean coastline of the southeast corner of France. There is no official boundary, but it is usually considered to extend from Cassis, Toulon or Saint-Tropez on the west to Menton at the France\u2013Italy border in the east, where the Italian Riviera joins. The coast is entirely within the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region of France. The Principality of Monaco is a semi-enclave within the region, surrounded on three sides by France and fronting the Mediterranean. Riviera is an Italian word that corresponds to the ancient Ligurian territory, wedged between the Var and Magra rivers. The C\u00f4te d'Azur is a nickname given by France to the County of Nice after its annexation in 1860, because the rain and cold wind Mistral were stopped by the Alps and the climate was similar to that of the north of Italy, even in winter, with a sky as blue as its sea, the French Riviera. After the 2000s it was extended to the rest of Southern France, although the geography, culture or climate is different. The County of Nice is a mountainous area like Italy which stands out from the South of France. While the Saharan warm wind Sirocco blows over Italy, the Mistral blows over the South of France. As the County of Nice is protected by the Alps, it has the Northern Italian climate.This coastline was one of the first modern resort areas. It began as a winter health resort for the British upper class at the end of the 18th century. With the arrival of the railway in the mid-19th century, it became the playground and vacation spot of British, Russian, and other aristocrats, such as Queen Victoria, Tsar Alexander II and King Edward VII, when he was Prince of Wales. In the summer, it also played home to many members of the Rothschild family. In the first half of the 20th century, it was frequented by artists and writers, including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Francis Bacon, Edith Wharton, Somerset Maugham and Aldous Huxley, as well as wealthy Americans and Europeans. After World War II, it became a popular tourist destination and convention site. Many celebrities, such as Elton John and Brigitte Bardot, have homes in the region. Officially, the French Riviera is home to 163 nationalities with 83,962 foreign residents, although estimates of the number of non-French nationals living in the area are often much higher. Its largest city is Nice, which has a population of 346,251 as of 2016. The city is the centre of a communaut\u00e9 urbaine \u2013 Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur \u2013 bringing together 24 communes and more than 500,000 inhabitants and 933,080 in the urban area. Nice is home to Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport, France's third-busiest airport (after Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport), which is on an area of partially reclaimed coastal land at the western end of the Promenade des Anglais. A second airport at Mandelieu was once the region's commercial airport, but is now mainly used by private and business aircraft.The A8 autoroute runs through the region, as does the old main road generally known as the Route nationale 7 (officially now the DN7 in the Var and the D6007 in the Alpes-Maritimes). High-speed trains serve the coastal region and inland to Grasse, with the TGV Sud-Est service reaching Nice-Ville station in five and a half hours from Paris. The French Riviera has a total population of more than two million. It contains the seaside resorts of Cap-d'Ail, Beaulieu-sur-Mer, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Villefranche-sur-Mer, Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, Cannes, Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Fr\u00e9jus, Sainte-Maxime and Saint-Tropez. It is also home to a high tech and science park (French: technopole) at Sophia-Antipolis (north of Antibes) and a research and technology centre at the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis. The region has 35,000 students, of whom 25 percent are working toward a doctorate. The French Riviera is a major yachting and cruising area with several marinas along its coast. According to the C\u00f4te d'Azur Economic Development Agency, each year the Riviera hosts 50 percent of the world's superyacht fleet, with 90 percent of all superyachts visiting the region's coast at least once in their lifetime. As a tourist centre, the French Riviera benefits from 310 to 330 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 miles) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\n=== Origin of term ===\n\nThe term French Riviera is typical of English use. It was built by analogy with the term Italian Riviera, which extends east of the French Riviera (from Ventimiglia to La Spezia). As early as the 19th century, the British referred to the region as the Riviera or the French Riviera, usually referring to the eastern part of the coast, between Monaco and the Italian border. Originally, riviera is an Italian noun which means \"coastline\".The name C\u00f4te d'Azur was given to the coast by the writer St\u00e9phen Li\u00e9geard in his book, La C\u00f4te d\u2019azur, published in December 1887. Li\u00e9geard was born in Dijon, in the French department of C\u00f4te-d'Or, and adapted that name by substituting the azure colour of the Mediterranean for the gold of C\u00f4te-d'Or.\n\nIn Occitan (Ni\u00e7ard and Proven\u00e7al) and French, the only usual names are C\u00f2sta d'Azur in Occitan and C\u00f4te d'Azur in French. A term like \"French Riviera\" (Ribiera Francesa in Occitan, Riviera Fran\u00e7aise in French) would only be used in literal translation, or adaptations of it. For instance, in French, \"Riviera Fran\u00e7aise\" is found in the online Larousse encyclopedia to refer to the holidays of a group of English workers (moreover, in Occitan, the word ribiera \"coastline\" mostly works as a common name, whereas in French, the old-fashioned term Rivi\u00e8re de G\u00eanes was used to refer to the Italian Riviera whose center is Genoa).\n\n\n=== Disputes over the extent of the Riviera and the C\u00f4te d'Azur ===\nC\u00f4te d'Azur and the French Riviera have no official boundaries. Some sources put the western boundary at Saint-Tropez. Others include Saint Tropez, Hy\u00e8res or Toulon in the Var (departement), or as far as Cassis in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne departement.\nIn her 1955 novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Patricia Highsmith describes the Riviera as including all of the coast between Toulon and the Italian border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From prehistory to the Bronze Age ===\nThe region of the French Riviera has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Primitive tools dating to between 1,000,000 and 1,050,000 years ago were discovered in the Grotte du Vallonnet, near Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, with stones and bones of animals, including bovines, rhinoceros, and bison. At Terra Amata (380,000 to 230,000 years ago), near the Nice Port, a fireplace was discovered that is one of the oldest found in Europe.Stone dolmens, monuments from the Bronze Age, can be found near Draguignan, while the Valley of Marvels (Vall\u00e9e des Merveilles) near Mount B\u00e9go, at 2,000 m (6,600 ft) elevation, is presumed to have been an outdoor religious sanctuary, having over 40,000 drawings of people and animals, dated to about 2000 BC.\n\n\n=== Greek influence ===\nBeginning in the 7th century BC, Greek sailors from Phocaea in Asia Minor began to visit and then build emporia along the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Emporia were started at Olbia (Hy\u00e8res); Antipolis (Antibes) and Nikaia (Nice). These settlements, which traded with the inhabitants of the interior, became rivals of the Etruscans and Phoenicians, who also visited the C\u00f4te d'Azur.\n\n\n=== Roman colonization ===\nIn 8 BC the Emperor Augustus built an imposing trophy monument at La Turbie (the Trophy of the Alps or Trophy of Augustus) to mark the pacification of the region.\nRoman towns, monuments and amphitheatres were built along the C\u00f4te d'Azur and many still survive, such as the amphitheatre and baths at Cimiez, above Nice, and the amphitheatre, Roman walls and other remains at Fr\u00e9jus.\n\n\n=== Barbarians and Christians ===\nRoman Provence reached the height of its power and prosperity during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. In the mid-3rd century, Germanic peoples began to invade the region, and Roman power weakened.\nIn the same period, Christianity started to become a powerful force in the region. The first cathedrals were built in the 4th century, and bishoprics were established: in Fr\u00e9jus at the end of the 4th century, Cimiez and Vence in 439, and Antibes in 442. The oldest Christian structure still in existence on the C\u00f4te d'Azur is the baptistery of Fr\u00e9jus Cathedral, built at the end of the 5th century, which also saw the founding of the first monastery in the region, Lerins Monastery on an island off the coast at Cannes.\nThe fall of the Western Roman Empire in the first half of the 5th century was followed by invasions of Provence by the Visigoths, the Burgundians and the Ostrogoths. There was then a long period of wars and dynastic quarrels, which in turn led to further invasions by the Saracens and the Normans in the 9th century.\n\n\n=== The Counts of Provence and the House of Grimaldi ===\nSome peace was restored to the coast by the establishment in 879 of a new kingdom of Provence, ruled first by the Bosonids dynasty (879\u20131112), then by the Catalans (1112\u20131246), and finally by the Angevins (1246\u20131382, elder branch, 1382\u20131483 (younger branch).\n\nIn the 13th century, another powerful political force appeared, the House of Grimaldi. Descended from a Genoese nobleman expelled from Genoa by his rivals in 1271, members of the different branches of the Grimaldis took power in Monaco, Antibes and Nice, and built castles at Grimaud, Cagnes-sur-Mer and Antibes. Albert II, the current Prince of Monaco is a descendant of the Grimaldis.\nIn 1388, the city of Nice and its surrounding territory, from the mouth of the Var to the Italian border, were separated from Provence and came under the protection of the House of Savoy. The territory was called the Comt\u00e9 de Nice after 1526, and thereafter its language, history and culture were separate from those of Provence until 1860, when it was re-attached to France under Napoleon III.\nProvence retained its formal independence until 1480, when the last Comte de Provence, Ren\u00e9 I of Naples, died and left the Comt\u00e9 to his nephew, Charles du Maine, who in turn left it to Louis XI of France. In 1486, Provence formally became part of France.\n\n\n=== Popularity with the British upper class in 18th and 19th centuries ===\nUntil the end of the 18th century, the area later known as the C\u00f4te d'Azur was a remote and impoverished region, known mostly for fishing, olive groves and the production of flowers for perfume (manufactured in Grasse).\nA new phase began when the coast became a fashionable health resort for the British upper class in the late 18th century. The first British traveller to describe its benefits was the novelist Tobias Smollett, who visited Nice in 1763 when it was still an Italian city within the Kingdom of Sardinia. Smollett brought Nice and its warm winter climate to the attention of the British aristocracy with Travels through France and Italy, written in 1765. At about the same time, a Scottish doctor, John Brown, became famous for prescribing what he called climato-therapy, a change in climate, to cure a variety of diseases including tuberculosis, known then as consumption. The French historian Paul Gonnet wrote that, as a result, Nice was filled with \"a colony of pale and listless English women and listless sons of nobility near death\".\nIn 1834, a British nobleman and politician named Henry Peter Brougham, First Baron Brougham and Vaux, who had played an important part in the abolition of the slave trade, travelled with an unwell sister to the south of France, intending to go to Italy. A cholera epidemic in Italy forced him to stop at Cannes, where he enjoyed the climate and scenery so much that he bought land and built a villa. He began to spend his winters there and, owing to his fame, others followed: Cannes soon had a small British enclave.\nRobert Louis Stevenson was a later British visitor who came for his health. In 1882 he rented a villa called La Solitude at Hy\u00e8res, where he wrote much of A Child's Garden of Verses.\n\n\n=== Railway, gambling and royalty ===\n\nIn 1864, six years after Nice became part of France following the Second Italian War of Independence the first railway was completed, making Nice and the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. One hundred thousand visitors arrived in 1865. By 1874, residents of foreign enclaves in Nice, most of whom were British, numbered 25,000.\n\nIn the mid-19th century British and French entrepreneurs began to see the potential of promoting tourism along the C\u00f4te d'Azur. At the time, gambling was illegal in France and Italy. In 1856, the Prince of Monaco, Charles III, began constructing a casino in Monaco, which was called a health spa to avoid criticism by the church. The casino was a failure, but in 1863 the Prince signed an agreement with Fran\u00e7ois Blanc, a French businessman already operating a successful casino at Baden-Baden (southwestern Germany), to build a resort and new casino. Blanc arranged for steamships and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, and built hotels, gardens and a casino in a place called Sp\u00e9lugues. At the suggestion of his mother, Princess Caroline, Charles III renamed the place Monte Carlo after himself. When the railway reached Monte Carlo in 1870, many thousands of visitors began to arrive and the population of the principality of Monaco doubled.\nThe French Riviera soon became a popular destination for European royalty. Just days after the railway reached Nice in 1864, Tsar Alexander II of Russia visited on a private train, followed soon afterwards by Napoleon III and then Leopold II, the King of the Belgians.\n\nQueen Victoria was a frequent visitor. In 1882 she stayed in Menton, and in 1891 spent several weeks at the Grand Hotel at Grasse. In 1892 she stayed at the Hotel Cost-belle in Hy\u00e8res. In successive years from 1895 to 1899 she stayed in Cimiez in the hills above Nice. First, in 1895 and 1896, she patronised the Grand H\u00f4tel, while in later years she and her staff took over the entire west wing of the Excelsior H\u00f4tel R\u00e9gina, which had been designed with her needs specifically in mind (part of which later became the home and studio of the renowned artist Henri Matisse). She travelled with an entourage of between sixty and a hundred, including chef, ladies in waiting, dentist, Indian servants, her own bed and her own food.The Prince of Wales was a regular visitor to Cannes, starting in 1872. He frequented the Club Nautique, a private club on the Croisette, the fashionable seafront boulevard of Cannes. He visited there each spring for a two-month period, observing yacht races from shore while the royal yacht, Britannia, was sailed by professional crewmen. After he became King in 1901, he never again visited the French Riviera.\nBy the end of the 19th century the C\u00f4te d'Azur began to attract artistic painters, who appreciated the climate, the bright colors and clear light. Among them were Auguste Renoir, who settled in Cagnes-sur-Mer and in Mougins, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.\n\n\n=== Inter-war period, American visitors and decline of the aristocracy ===\nThe First World War brought down many of the royal houses of Europe and altered the nature and the calendar of the French Riviera. Following the war, greater numbers of Americans began arriving, with business moguls and celebrities eventually outnumbering aristocrats. The 'High Society' scene moved from a winter season to a summer season.\nAmericans began coming to the south of France in the 19th century. Henry James set part of his novel, The Ambassadors, on the Riviera. James Gordon Bennett Jr, the son and heir of the founder of the New York Herald, had a villa in Beaulieu. Industrialist John Pierpont Morgan gambled at Monte Carlo and bought 18th-century paintings by Fragonard in Grasse \u2013 shipping them to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\nA feature of the French Riviera in the inter-war years was the Train Bleu, an all first-class sleeper train which brought wealthy passengers down from Calais. It made its first trip in 1922, and carried Winston Churchill, Somerset Maugham, and the future King Edward VIII over the years.\nWhile Europe was still recovering from the war and the American dollar was strong, American writers and artists started arriving on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Edith Wharton wrote The Age of Innocence (1920) at a villa near Hy\u00e8res, winning the Pulitzer Prize for the novel (the first woman to do so). Dancer Isadora Duncan frequented Cannes and Nice, but died in 1927 when her scarf caught in a wheel of the Amilcar motor car in which she was a passenger and strangled her. The writer F. Scott Fitzgerald first visited with his wife Zelda in 1924, stopping at Hy\u00e8res, Cannes and Monte Carlo \u2013 eventually staying at Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, where he wrote much of The Great Gatsby and began Tender is the Night.\nWhile Americans were largely responsible for making summer the high season, a French fashion designer, Coco Chanel, made sunbathing fashionable. She acquired a striking tan during the summer of 1923, and tans then became the fashion in Paris.\nDuring the abdication crisis of the British Monarchy in 1936, Wallis Simpson, the intended bride of King Edward VIII, was staying at the Villa Lou Viei in Cannes, talking with the King by telephone each day. After his abdication, the Duke of Windsor (as he became) and his new wife stayed at the Villa La Cro\u00eb on the Cap d'Antibes.\nThe English playwright and novelist Somerset Maugham also became a resident in 1926, buying the Villa La Mauresque toward the tip of Cap Ferrat, near Nice.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nWhen Germany invaded France in June 1940, the remaining British colony was evacuated to Gibraltar and eventually to Britain. American Jewish groups helped some of the Jewish artists living in the south of France, such as Marc Chagall, to escape to the United States. In August 1942, 600 Jews from Nice were rounded up by French police and sent to Drancy, and eventually to death camps. In all about 5,000 French Jews from Nice perished during the war.\nFollowing D-Day in Normandy, Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil), the code name for the Allied invasion of Southern France, commenced on 15 August 1944, when American parachute troops landed near Fr\u00e9jus, and a fleet landed 60,000 troops of the American Seventh Army and French First Army between Cavalaire and Agay, east of Saint-Rapha\u00ebl. German resistance crumbled in days.\nSaint-Tropez was badly damaged by German mines at the time of the liberation. The novelist Colette organized an effort to assure the town was rebuilt in its original style.\nWhen the war ended, artists Marc Chagall and Pablo Picasso returned to live and work.\n\n\n=== Post-war period and late 20th century ===\nThe Cannes Film Festival was launched in September 1946, marking the return of French cinema to world screens. The Festival Palace was built in 1949 on the site of the old Cercle Nautique, where the Prince of Wales had met his mistresses in the late 19th century. The release of the French film Et Dieu\u2026 cr\u00e9a la femme (And God Created Woman) in November 1956 was a major event for the Riviera, making an international star of Brigitte Bardot, and making an international tourist destination of Saint-Tropez, particularly for the new class of wealthy international travellers called the jet set.\nThe marriage of American film actress Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier of Monaco on 18 April 1956, attracted world attention once again. It was viewed on television by 30 million people.\nDuring the 1960s, the Mayor of Nice, Jacques M\u00e9decin, decided to reduce the dependence of the Riviera on ordinary tourism, and to make it a destination for international congresses and conventions. He built the Palais des Congr\u00e8s at the Acropolis in Nice, and founded a Chagall Museum and a Matisse Museum at Cimiez. High-rise apartment buildings and real estate developments began to spread.\nAt the end of August, 1997, Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed spent their last days together on his father's yacht off Pampelonne Beach near Saint-Tropez, shortly before they were killed in a traffic accident in the Alma Tunnel in Paris.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Places ===\nPlaces on the C\u00f4te d'Azur (following the broadest definition), following the coast from south-west to north-east, include:\n\nCassis\nLa Ciotat\nBandol\nSanary-sur-Mer\nSix-Fours-les-Plages\nLa Seyne-sur-Mer\nToulon\nHy\u00e8res and the \u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res (Porquerolles, Port-Cros and \u00cele du Levant)\nLe Lavandou\nCavalaire-sur-Mer\nSaint-Tropez\nInland \u2013 Grimaud, with Port-Grimaud on the coast\nSainte-Maxime\nRoquebrune-sur-Argens\nFr\u00e9jus and Saint-Rapha\u00ebl\nInland \u2013 Fayence\nLes Adrets-de-l'Est\u00e9rel\nTanneron\nTh\u00e9oule-sur-Mer\nMandelieu-la-Napoule\nInland \u2013 Grasse\nInland \u2013 Mougins\nthe \u00celes de L\u00e9rins \u2013 \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite and \u00cele Saint-Honorat\nCannes\nInland \u2013 Vallauris\nInland \u2013 Valbonne\nInland \u2013 Sophia-Antipolis\nGolfe-Juan\nJuan-les-Pins\nAntibes\nInland \u2013 Biot\nVilleneuve-Loubet\nCagnes-sur-Mer\nInland \u2013 Vence\nInland \u2013 Saint-Paul-de-Vence\nInland \u2013 Saint-Jeannet\nSaint-Laurent-du-Var\nInland \u2013 Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re\nNice\nVillefranche-sur-Mer\nSaint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat\nBeaulieu-sur-Mer\n\u00c8ze\nCap d'Ail\nMonaco (including Monte-Carlo)\nBeausoleil\nRoquebrune-Cap-Martin\nMenton\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nSome data related to tourism on the Riviera in 2006:\n\nMore than 14 million tourists\n52% of customers from abroad\n65 million nights stayed\nTourists spending \u20ac5 billion\n75,000 jobs; tourism is 18% of total employment in the Alpes-Maritimes.\n500,000 tourists in the High Country\n500,000 delegates\n3 million admissions to museums and monuments\nMore than 45% of tourists come by air\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe French Riviera has a Mediterranean climate, with sunny, hot, dry summers and mild winters. Winter temperatures are moderated by the Mediterranean; days of frost are rare. The average daily low temperature in Nice in January is 5.4 \u00b0C (41.7 \u00b0F); the January average daily low temperature in Toulon is 6.2 \u00b0C (43.2 \u00b0F). The average high temperature in August in Nice is 28.6 \u00b0C (83.5 \u00b0F); in Toulon the average daily high temperature is 29.7 \u00b0C (85.5 \u00b0F)\nThe C\u00f4te d'Azur receives more rainfall annually than Paris (803.3 mm (31.63 in) annually in Nice and 684.8 mm (26.96 in) in Toulon compared with 649.8 mm (25.58 in) in Paris),  but the rainy days are much less frequent; 111 rainy days a year in Paris compared with 61 days in Toulon and 63 in Nice. Toulon has 2,793 hours of sunshine a year, Nice has 2,668 hours.Micro-climates exist in these coastal regions, and there can be great differences in the weather between various locations. Strong winds such as the Mistral, a cold dry wind from the northwest or from the east, are another characteristic, particularly in the winter.\n\n\n==== Nice and Alpes-Maritimes ====\nNice and the Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement are sheltered by the Alps.  The winds are usually gentle, from the sea to the land, though sometimes the mistral blows strongly from the northwest, or, turned by the mountains, from the east. In 1956 a mistral from the northwest reached 180 kilometres per hour (110 mph) at Nice Airport. Sometimes, in summer, the sirocco brings high temperatures and reddish desert sand from the Sahara. (See Winds of Provence.)\nRain can be torrential, particularly in the autumn, when storms and rain are caused by the difference between the colder air inland and the warm Mediterranean water temperature (20\u201324 \u00b0C [68\u201375 \u00b0F]). The rainiest months are September (75.6 millimetres [2.98 in] average rainfall); October (143.9 millimetres [5.67 in]); November (94.3 millimetres [3.71 in]) and December (87.8 millimetres [3.46 in]).Snow on the coast is rare, falling on average once every ten years. 1956 was exceptional, when 20 cm (7.9 in) blanketed the coast. In January 1985 the coast between Cannes and Menton received 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in). In the mountains, snow is present from November to May.\n\n\n==== Var ====\nThe d\u00e9partement of Var (which includes Saint-Tropez and Hy\u00e8res) has a climate slightly warmer, drier and sunnier than Nice and Alpes-Maritimes, but is less sheltered from the wind.\nThe mistral wind, which brings cold and dry air down from the upper Alpine regions via the Rh\u00f4ne valley and extends with diminishing intensity along the C\u00f4te d'Azur, blows frequently during the winter. Strong winds blow for about 75 days a year in Fr\u00e9jus.\n\n\n== Events and festivals ==\nSeveral major events take place:\n\nMonaco and southeast France: Rallye Automobile Monte-Carlo, January\nMonaco: International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo, January / February\nMandelieu-la-Napoule: La F\u00eate du Mimosa, February\nNice: Carnival, February\nMenton: Lemon Festival, February\nTourrettes-sur-Loup: Violet Festival, March\nMonaco: Monte-Carlo Masters, April\u2013May\nMonaco: Formula One Grand Prix race, May\nGrasse; Rose Festival, May\nCannes: Cannes Film Festival and Cannes Film Market, May\nNice: Jazz Festival, July\nJuan-les-Pins: Jazz \u00e0 Juan, late July.\nGrasse: Jasmine Festival, August\nToulon: Toulon Tournament, Tall Ships' Race\n\n\n== Painters ==\n\nThe climate and vivid colors of the Mediterranean attracted many famous artists during the 19th and 20th centuries. They included:\n\nPierre Bonnard (1867\u20131947); retired to and died at Le Cannet.\nRoger Broders (1883\u20131953); Parisian travel poster illustrator.\nMarc Chagall (1887\u20131985); lived in Saint-Paul-de-Vence between 1948 and 1985.\nHenri-Edmond Cross (1856\u20131910); discovered the C\u00f4te d'Azur in 1883, and painted at Monaco and Hy\u00e8res.\nMaurice Denis (1870\u20131943); painted at St. Tropez and Bandol.\nRaoul Dufy (1877\u20131953); whose wife was from Nice, painted in the region, including in Nice.\nAlbert Marquet (1873\u20131947); painted at St. Tropez.\nHenri Matisse (1869\u20131954); first visited St. Tropez in 1904. In 1917 he settled in Nice, first at the H\u00f4tel Beau Rivage, then at the H\u00f4tel de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, then at la Villa des Alli\u00e9s in Cimiez. In 1921 he lived in an apartment in Nice, next to the flower market and overlooking the sea, where he lived until 1938. He then moved to the H\u00f4tel R\u00e9gina in the hills of Cimiez, above Nice. During World War II he lived in Vence, then returned to Cimiez, where he died and is buried.\nClaude Monet (1840\u20131927); visited Menton, Bordighera, Juan-les-Pins, Monte Carlo, Nice, Cannes, Beaulieu and Villefranche, and painted a number of seascapes of Cap Martin, near Menton, and at Cap d'Antibes.\nEdvard Munch (1863\u20131944); visited and painted in Nice and Monte Carlo (where he developed a passion for gambling), and rented a villa at Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat in 1891.\nPablo Picasso (1881\u20131973); spent each summer from 1919 to 1939 on the C\u00f4te d'Azur, and moved there permanently in 1946, first at Vallauris, then at Mougins, where he spent his last years.\nAuguste Renoir (1841\u20131919); visited Beaulieu, Grasse, Saint-Rapha\u00ebl and Cannes, before finally settling in Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1907, where he bought a farm in the hills and built a new house and workshop on the grounds. He continued to paint there until his death in 1919. His house is now a museum.\nPaul Signac (1863\u20131935); visited St. Tropez in 1892, and bought a villa, La Hune, at the foot of citadel in 1897. It was at his villa that his friend, Henri Matisse, painted his famous Luxe, Calme et Volupt\u00e9 in 1904. Signac made numerous paintings along the coast.\nYves Klein (1928\u20131962); a native of Nice, considered an important figure in post-war European art.\nSacha Sosno (1937\u20132013); French painter and sculptor who lived and worked in Nice.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGardens of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur\nSouthern France\nItalian Riviera\nPortuguese Riviera\nRiviera\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nHenry de Lumley, La Grand Histoire des premiers hommes europ\u00e9ens, Odile Jacob, Paris, 2010.

          "Nice museum.  ALL Chagall - which is interesting, but quite single-focused.  The pieces I liked best were the outdoor mosaic and the details in the Garden of Eden.  Stained glass in the auditorium was also a treat!",
          "This is a lovely, intimate museum with a great collection of his work. Although I admit I would not have gone there on my own, I was rather pleasantly surprised by the quality of his small prints - having airways known the larger paintings \u2026",
          "I'm not an artist, or an art critic but I know what I like... I think? And this got me thinking and I left a bit confused. Enjoyed the visit though.",
          "It was written in the book that there are over 450 pieces of his work. However, I could only see a few dozen of his. The staff said every 6 month they rotate them and the rest of them stored under the basement..That was disappointing. It was really great to see  the big sized of his paintings there.",
          "Superb single artist gallery.  Mainly devoted to Chagall's biblical works this museum also has his life story in film plus other works.  A must if you enjoy impressionism.  We entered free on a Sunday.",
          "Impressive little museum. The architecture is also modern and nice. Excellent to spend 1-2 hours and change ideas.",
          "The magnificent museum. Amazing mosaic. 17 paintings of Chagall\u2019s Biblical message are great.",
          "Small but quality collection, heavily religious.  Very pretty setting and the cafe in the garden has decent food for medium price. I had a huge salad of the day for 12.50 euros which is not bad for a tourist heavy place.\n10 euro admission \u2026",
          "What a truly beautiful wee gallery. They were showing two exhibitions when we visited. One was Chagall's Old Testament and the other was a photographic work by someone whose name escapes me...both were brilliant. Nicely played out with lots to see and plenty of space. Nice wee garden cafe too.",
          "Very interesting museum, well curated and displaying great Chagall masterpieces. I suggest grabbing the free audio guides offered in exchange for an ID: I found them very useful to provide valuable information on the paintings and artist. \u2026",
          "Superb museum and works of art. Could easily spend hours and hours here.",
          "This is, quite possibly, my favourite art museum in the world. Chagall's artwork is overwhelming beautiful on its own, but the museum also provides the perfect setting for its exposition (one can feel Chagall's hand at every turn - it makes \u2026",
          "Very nice museum. You can enjoy hours and hours there learning about Chagall's artwork and life story.",
          "Perfect collection of paintings and also a pretty good construction and architecture of museum\nIt seems like you can walk there for hours",
          "It was written in the book that there are over 450 pieces of his work. However, I could only see a few dozen of his. The staff said every 6 month they rotate them and the rest of them stored under the basement..That was disappointing. It was really great to see  the big sized of his paintings there.",
          "The Marc Chagall Museum presents the works of the renowned painter, Chagall. The museum was created in Chagall's life, which also contributed to the design and planning of the museum. Chagall is the one who chose how each of his works will \u2026",
          "I love Chagall! This museum was designed by the artist and had a good collection of his works. Highly recommended.",
          "Loved seeing Chagall\u2019s work, however ... I think it is too pricey (10 euros) for the 12+ paintings they display + we were not able to see the stained glass because they were showing a movie by another contemporary artist and put the \u2026",
          "A great emotional art and spiritual experience. Chagall was a master of colour and symbolism. What a privilege to experience his art in a purpose built building. The theatre with it\u2019s beautiful lead glass windows is a great venue. We also enjoyed the movie on \u201cChagall\u2019s life. More English subscripts would have been welcome though.",

          "If you are an admirer of Chagall's art, you will appreciate and enjoy this Museum.  There are many examples of Chagall's work, but the core of the collection is religious works that are impressive and moving.  The museum is well laid out \u2026",
          "Very interesting stories in your ears with their audioguide",
          "I'm not really a Chagall fan, but I enjoyed the art and the museum. The space was nice and the included audioguide was great and helpful. His work while being very religious is still relatable and pleasing to eye.",
          "Surrealistically beautiful!\nDon\u2019t forget your ID cause the audio guide is included in the ticket price and ID is needed to rent it. I did not have my ID, so unfortunately could not use the guide , which was a pity. Still it was worth coming here. The paintings are amazing!",
          "Chagall is everywhere in large format on every wall. Parking is challenging, but worth the trouble. There is a cafe inside which has  a good selection and very reasonable prices. 2 thumbs up.",
          "Beautiful museum, horrible experience.\nThe museum is great, full of great artworks of Chagall. Unfortunately, we had a horrible experience at the gift shop. We decided to purchase a small poster that cost 6\u20ac. I paid 20\u20ac bill, and the lady \u2026",
          "What a truly beautiful wee gallery. They were showing two exhibitions when we visited.  Well curated and displaying great Chagall masterpieces.You have a series of large paintings illustrating chapters from the Bible.",
          "There is not much variety in the works that are displayed here, but I still found it worth the visit.\nThe documentary shown about the life of Chagall was very nice.",
          "Nice place to see Chagall's works, friendly helpful staff, nice space to see works displayed, excellent collection.",
          "A definite must see when in Nice. We'd suggest to get an audio guide (2\u20ac) to understand the story and history behind these famous works of art.",
          "Stunning pieces in a beautiful located museum. We loved the fact that Chagall himself placed the artworks himself with no respect to the historic order of events. Highly recommendable if you love Chagall, art itself or amazingly compositioned rooms which incredibly enhance the atmosphere.",
          "Designed by Chagall himself. Fascinating idea. Unfortunately two rooms were closed",
          "Beautiful museum with a nice shop and cafe in the garden. The Chagall works are not the most famous but quit monumental and strong. A little strange that the 24 hour museum ticket doesn\u2019t include this museum.",
          "One of the must go places to see some key works of Chagall. You have a series of large paintings illustrating chapters from the Bible. Most unexpected finding is actually chapel (i think) at the edge of the museum. It harbors painted glass by Chagall and also a painted piano.",
          "Not the retrospective I expected from a dedicated Chagall museum although one does feel the spirit of the artist walking through the rooms.",
          "Marc Chagall was simply just so clever! The color scheme is awesome",
          "Fab collection dont miss it.",
          "Beautiful. But too small..\n\nI like the peaceful air there.\nThe number of works was smaller than I expected.\nSo I felt it was a liittle bit expensive..",
          "Beautiful paintings and mosaic. Great building. The auditorium has air conditioning and very comfortable chairs",
          "We were denied entrance because we had luggage with us and it was considered \"too big\" despite it obviously fitting into the lockers. I've been admitted into many museums bringing the very same luggage with me and no one ever complained \u2026",
          "Really relaxing, well-presented museum dedicated entirely to Chagall",
          "Good video, stained glass windows, huge mosaics, series of large Bible paintings. Then lunch in outdoor cafe!",
          "A great, but small, collection of Chagalls work. Charming little cafe in the garden worth a visit on its own. If you want Chagall, you get Chagall.",
          "A lot of inspiration. Very good collection of paintings. The museum has unique atmosphere",
          "The selection of paintings here is tilted, exactly as you'd expect from the name of the gallery, towards Biblical scenes, so it doesn't give a broad or deep view of Chagall's work. Nevertheless it is a delightful selection, vividly coloured \u2026",
          "A great museum showing Chagall's work, most of which has religious overtones. There are also works by Clement Cogitori, including his work Passages which some may find distopian but very good.",
          "Small but lovely museum about the life and work of Chagall. Definitely try to catch the documentation in the theater. English language version started at 12:00 on a Friday.",

          "Not very impressed. Should be opened to public free if charge",
          "A perfect solution to a gray day in Nice. Chagall\u2019s brilliant canvases show his inspiration from the colors of the Mediterranean in interpreting passages from the Old Testament. Free audio guides enhance the experience. Note that the extensive explanations on the audio guide mean that a visit of 2 hours minimum is needed.",

          "DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING OF VALUE IN YOUR CAR IN NICE.  Lovely museum with sweet little cafe and gift shop.",
          "Loved the setting-  the museum is small but you get to really enjoy 16 works very up close, as well as stained glass windows and a mosaic. \nI am removing a star for the horrid staff as well as the ridiculous requirement of a passport to be left behind in exchange for an audio guide.",
          "Excellent, very nice and the explanations per headset and different language is making the visit of the museum to an extraordinary experience....and you get keen to know more about art and artists.",
          "Really worth a visit. Free for students. Paintings were amazing",
          "Great. The video presentation was very interesting too. Be careful though- you need a separate ticket to get in to this museum, ie you can't use the combined ticket for municipal museums, as it is a national museum.",
          "Russian painter Chagal set up in Nice. This exhibition of his works are amazing and biblically influenced. However the viewer will enjoy this museum. Well worth a visit",
          "WARNING! \nIf you're driving to the museum DO NOT park on the street nearby. While visiting the museum from 10am to noon, my car windows were smashed in and my suitcase was stolen from the trunk! All this within 100 meters of the museum in broad daylight.",
          "The collection of Marc Chagall is an exquisite mirror of the eyes of the artist.  The museum contains an array of collection from mosaics, stained glass, oil on canvass, water colors, and ceramics, all reflecting Chagall's belief in the \u2026",
          "Some stunning paintings. Smells pretty bad, unfortunately. Cosy museum. Many places to sit.",
          "There are a lots of Marc Chagall artworks. Every artworks is so amazing~~ My favorite mus\u00e9e in Nice.",
          "If you are willing to see 12 painting or should i say childish doodlings, for 10 euros this is the place for you. Chagall or not, this place should be incorporated into the Nice art museum... I guess this mascarade is due to some complacent \u2026",
          "A true gem. Wonderful collection. Peaceful garden",
          "A very relaxing place to visit. Makes you think about and consider the inspiring art work and the meaning behind the paintings. We really enjoyed exploring the art gallery.",
          "Absolute must see! Wonderful pieces from throughout his career and great museum design and only 8\u20ac entry. Well worth it! Very easy to get there using the 17 bus",
          "A wandering walk brought us here. Amazing, beautiful. Once in a lifetime experience.",
          "Excellent. Audio guide did wonderful job of describing each painting. Staff most helpful. Outdoor cafe on the grounds was pleasant surprise.",
          "Loved the museum, the staff were pretty rude though. Usually, there is no fee for students, only adults. Luckily, the day we came, there was some event going on so we got in for free! There's a gift store at the entrance, which is nice. And a caf\u00e9 outside.",
          "First of all, in front of the entrance there were two prices shown (8\u20ac when there is no temporary ehibition and 10\u20ac when there is a temporary exhibition). At the ticket counter we asked whether there is a temporary exhibition on going. His \u2026",
          "Great museum with large, colorful paintings, mostly based on stories from the bible.",
          "You will see how magnificient Chagall's paintings.",
          "This is the only museum in France opened during painter's life! Designed according to Chagall's instructions to make visitor feel like at home. And it really does! Not overwhelming (as art museums tend to be) just enough to hold a fiest around incredible art collected here!",
          "Modern Museum with attidude just a bit expensive.",
          "Incredible place. Collection is outstanding.  Small enough not to overwhelm and exhaust, but masterpieces leave a lasting impression. Very good notes both in French and English attached to every painting,  so even if you don't want to take \u2026",
          "Excellent small museum with some very beautiful examples of Chagall's work.",
          "Nice small museum in a lovely residential Nice neighborhood. Enjoyed the mosaic.",
          "Small museum. Under 18 are free, over 18 are \u20ac10 each. Lots of cool art, very biblical art. Very colorful and exciting. The stained glass is a site to behold and is truly breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit, as it doesn't take long to go through the entire exhibit. The staff are all really friendly as well. Adorable gift shop.",

          "Quite a small museum and did not have as many chagall paintings as I expected, I thought some of his most famous paintings would be here. The movie in the theatre about chagalls life was all in French so I couldn't understand it. The audio \u2026",
          "Superb human-scale setting for dazzling canvases.",
          "Beautiful Museum & surrounding garden.",
          "Nice display of Chagall's work with audio description by handset. You need your driving licence as deposit for the handset though.",
          "Absolutely wonderful. Make sure to spend lots of time (and energy) here because the audioguide takes some time. Catching a short movie about Chagall's life was also beneficial. Afterwards, recharge with a coffee and treat at the outdoor cafe in the garden!",
          "Beautiful museum with a very insightful audio guide tour and a full length documentary in the theater. Mostly features Chagall's biblical works. Worth the visit if you're in Nice and enjoy art. The grounds are also lovely and there is a \u2026",
          "It is worth a visit but the museum has small number of art pieces and entry is 10 euro",

          "It\u2019s a small museum packed with Chagall. I didn\u2019t spend a huge amount of time here. I liked what I saw but did feel the entrance fee was steep. \nI got a feel for the artist just by wandering but regret not taking the audio guide which my partner says was first class.",

          "Good collection and a charming place",
          "super small exibition with expensive entry fee(10 euros for 3 rooms maybe?). super unfriendly reception staff who refused to give change to 50 euros so we had to wait till someone paied them some small changes.",
          "If you are under 26 and european you get free entrance in the gallery. Otherwise its 10\u20ac. I definitely recommend getting an audio guide. If you are thinking of taking your kids there, please do so! I am sure that kids will like Chagall's \u2026",
          "Huge amount of artwork, ranging from Chagall's early years to later years. Free audio guide is available and the whole museum is well curated. The museum itself is beautiful too.",
          "Lovely, clean building. The film room with stained glass windows showing the History of Chagall in super comfy seating, lovely staff, very friendly. Best part were the biblical illustrations. Museum shop and cafe adjacent to the entrance of the entrance to the museum.",
          "It's a private museum with very few pieces and really it's not interesting...",
          "A beautiful olive tree garden welcomes you to this small museum. Audioguides available at the front desk are informative yet concise, elucidating the many biblical allusions present throughout Chagall's works. Highly advise watching the \u2026",

          "Situated in calm and beautiful area. Quality exhibition on Chagall. nice garden.",
          "If you are in Nice, it places you must visit. The pictures were put by Chagall when he was alive. The museum holds the most significant collection of Chagall paintings. Visit coffee shop which is just outside the museum. It is an excellent \u2026",

          "I have to come back",
          "A nice place to be and amazing paintings although the documentary about Marc Chagall is really worth to watch. Chagall was very charismatic",
          "Great exhibition. Additionally they have a really nice cafe outdoor.",
          "Must see during your visit in Nice. Even if you are not addicted to painting or The Holy Bible. The exhibition is very interesting. The paintings brings to Life So much biblical motifs. Chagall combines them in absolutely unique way.",
          "Mindblowing! A must see while in Nice!",
          "10 Euros for a 15 minute run of the thing, the English variant of the movie starts at 16:00 what am I supposed to do here for another 2 hours, 12 paintings and that s it.\nThe ticket clerk was also rude.",
          "The size of the museum took me by surprise for the amount I had to pay at the door but there is a lot of information in there. I would highly recommend getting the audio guide as you do need it to understand Chagall's paintings. I love the \u2026",
          "The museum comprises some of Chagall's greatest works. You can also enjoy a film about his live in a small cinema room. Highly entertaining for your passion for art",
          "There are words no one will understand, that's why art is living by feelings inside.\n\nMust visit for art lovers.",
          "Excellent. The biblical series was well explained by the guide. Stained glass windows in auditorium impressive and linked nicely to an earlier visit to All Saints church in Tudeley. Well worth a visit.",

          "One day you will understand Why we need colors to descris the great wisdom of the Universe.",
          "Very small museum which is completed with random documentaries.  Not worth the entry price.",
          "Exciting collection of M. Chagall's masterpieces. Highly recommended",
          "Expensive for what it provides. Not many exhibitions. Just less than 20 paints of Chagall and that\u2019s all. Staff are not kind. Don\u2019t recommend unless you\u2019re a Chagall\u2019s fan.",
          "It is the best museum I ever visited.As you enter the garden  a lovely scent of lavender tickles your nostrils and you see the beautiful old olivetrees. A small caf\u00e9 offers a light lunch or coffe. Inside I got totally blown away by the \u2026",
          "Nice museum for a short walk! If you give your ID or passport, they give a free audio for explanations. Not many of Chagall\u2019s works we know are here though, but only of his earlier works.",
          "A great collection of Chagall artworks. Must see place in Nice. The entrance is free for EU citizens below 26 years of age.",
          "Enjoyable visit, especially if you\u2019re into Chagall. Most of the displays are written only in French. The museum cafe is worth the stop if you\u2019re looking for refreshments.",
          "Paintings and architecture of museum are in harmony. Design of museum also made with contribution of Chagall. Chagall wants to create an eternal home for his paintings with this museum.",
          "Have you ever been overwhelmed by pee smell in a museum main room? If not visit Marc Chagall National museum!",
          "Intesting to find out more about Chagall's strong religious background and values. But it seemed to me that his strong point was getting other people to build his designs for him, like the mosaic, the stained glass and the museum itself.",
          "Well organized museum with good audiphone narration. Opportunity to see Chagall's later works. Lovely garden cafe for a coffee.",
          "Wonderful vibrant paintings.",
          "Great place to escape crowds and view excellent pieces. It contains his religious, biblical work so if you're expecting the mermaids, you will have to look elsewhere. Also a bit small.",
          "We took a guide and she was very well explaining. In just 1 hour we got a very good understanding of the painter 's spirit.",
          "do not miss it. they announce projection every 15-20 min",

          "So great to visit a must for any one with a love of colour",
          "It is a small museum, but the biggest for fans of the Belarussian painter Marc Chagall. The architecture of the building, which was the first museum dedicated to the life's work of a living artist, is also interesting. The diversity of Marc \u2026",
          "So lovely",
          "This museum is so well done, it is no wonder that Chagall himself had a hand in building it. The biblical theme of the work, from the Song of Songs, lends an almost cathedral-like quality to the atmosphere. The video is quite good, worth \u2026",
          "Stunning collection of Chagall's large biblical works. The English language recorded commentary was excellent. Easily my favorite art museum in Provence.",
          "Beautiful setting and really well presented. Not a fan of the work though personally. Lovely cafe in the garden and gift shop well stocked but expensive. You get a free audio guide if you leave a credit card or ID card.",
          "This will turn you into Chagall fan if you are not one already. The collection was truely beautiful and meaningful. Audio guide was very good. Cafe outside was also nice.",
          "Great gallery, good size (not too big - you will have enough time to see and appreciate it all in an hour or two) with a great selection of Chagall work hung and curated partly by the artist himself. Was originally a museum showing his \u2026",
          "Ok, even as an athiest I had to really appreciate this place and the incredible art and storytelling of Chagall. He is a great artist with an incredible heart and this Museum is a testament to both. I think one can judge the quality of the \u2026",
          "Very well arranged. Lots of space, necessary for the large format paintings. Nice little cafe in the garden. Here\u2019s a picture of the wall mosaic which can be viewed from within the gallery.",
          "We loved it! Must see but take an Uber and consider getting a pass for multiple museums. It will save you money",
          "Nice museum.",
          "Very beautiful, extremely well lit and maintained, and accessible. Well worth the visit and absolutely get the audio guide.",
          "Museum of Chagall's mainly religiously themed work.  Had a few pieces of his ceramic and stone work as well.  There is a very small free parking lot for around 6 cars.",
          "Wonderful collection of his work. A must see. Allow at least an hour and a half. There currently are 13 pieces of his art on display in this very modern setting.",

          "Interesting and not much big.",
          "Excellent, the free audio guides were a plus!",
          "This museum was well worth the long, sweaty walk uphill. Chagall's art fused modern ideas with a staunch commitment to the faith, and the works did convey something quite spiritual. Having not known much of his work prior to the visit, I \u2026",
          "Probably a nice place if you're into biblical stories. I'd have liked something more, though.",
          "Amazing paintings, but small and the caf\u00e9 was VERY simple",
          "One of the most enjoyable museum visits for me. A rather small collection but amazing. Loved it.",
          "If you are a big fan of art containing contrasting colors and style of cubism, then this one is for you. Located half way through the hill, the museum is open until day time and contains a nice park outside. Costs 10 eur for entrance, but \u2026",
          "Good but too small",
          "Lovely place, a short walk from the train station. Caf\u00e9 in the garden is a plus. Not particularly extensive given the \u20ac10 entrance fee (July 2017). This is, however, surely the best place to see Chagall's 12 big biblical paintings. \n\nAs \u2026",
          "Fantastic museum. There\u2019s actually parking available, the staff is very friendly, the caf\u00e9 has delicious food at reasonable prices, and Chigall works are aplenty and of the highest quality. I love this small museum.",
          "This is a great museum with a stunning collection of Chagalls. Must-see in NIce.",
          "Just wonderful...",

          "As ussually Chagall makes a very huge impression on us. I reccomend this museum to everyone. Worth seeing.",
          "There was just one floor but the painting took me interest about Chagall. I want to see more his paintings.",
          "For some reason they didn't show the introductory movie about Chagall life and art they screened three months ago. The museum is small,  like a gallery.",
          "Nice museum with free audio guide provided. Remember to bring a photo ID that they'll keep while you have the audio guide. Any large bag will be stored while you roam the museum.",
          "Great museum. Love Chagall of course which helps. The little cafe is delightful as it is outside. However it ain't cheap and over the course of a few visits we have been overcharged each time so check bill carefully",
          "Beautiful museum. One of the best in Nice!",
          "Great paintings but let down by ridiculous rules.... Not allowed to use my folding gallery seat as a seat!!",
          "I really like Chagall's work, maybe because be manages to squeeze so many themes and references into each painting - it gives each one depth or at least there's a lot to find and explore.  Different from a lot of \"one thing\" pieces of \u2026",
          "Must have to visit in Nice! Do not forget to take your ID or passport to take audioguide inside",
          "To the museum's team:\nThe museum is one of the best.\nPlease respect Shagal's art and clean the pool.",
          "Decevant",
          "I love Chagall!!! Before I didn't know him but when I watched the film, I really appreciated his works.\n\nFree entrance during first Sundays of every month. Also, this is a National museum, hence, it is not included in the free Museum Pass of Nice for the residents.",
          "A nice little museum.",
          "Wonderful museum and cheap entrance fee",
          "Wonderful way to spend an hour.\nIt's a lovely building and garden.  The art was spectacular.  I highly recommend using the audio tour ( it's free with entry and exchange of ID) ",
          "Inspirational, peaceful.  You could combine this visit with a 25 minute stroll over to the Matisse Museum and adjoining Archaeological Museum of Nice-Cimiez. Tip: Watch out for the closed days, but if it is closed you have plenty of other \u2026",
          "It doesn't look too appealing from the outside, however inside its great, but the effort is focused too much on the shop",
          "Smaller museum, but great art",
          "Entrance fee is 10,- euros per person. A audio guide in several languages is included. The staff at the ticket window wasn't able to speak english, which I think is kind of amusing when you realise that most of the visitors are \u2026",
          "If you are in Nice, France you must visit this museum.",
          "Interesting art museum with multi language audio guide. Get a Nice pass to make it good value. Otherwise you need to be keen on Chagall to pay the entrance.",
          "Great paintings displayed with helpful descriptions (not just French).",
          "I'm a huge fan of this museum!",
          "Purpose-built for displaying his works. In danger of being too crowded like so many tourist venues. Pleasant but modest outdoor cafe and good specialist book concession. Difficult uphill location with poor public transport access and zero parking.",
          "Great exposition.",
          "My favourite painter . Vibrant colours and ultra traditional themes.",
          "Amazing. No more words.",

          "NIce place in NIce.",
          "Excellent. Well worth a visit.",
          "The museum structure and design are pretty cool and they have a little restaurant to have petit d\u00e9jeuner, \ud83c\udf66and drinks but something that  disappointed me, has been must of the paints are about religion and saints... so, is a specific exposition about specific Chagall\u2018s life time.",
          "It was really intersting and beautiful. I'm glad I visited it. Furthermore, my sons of 20 and 18 years entered without paying. They were enthusiastic about this museum too.",
          "Great museum. Wonderful experience and the art is not from this world.",

          "Very nice \"museum\" of one era (and not all his work)",
          "Only Chagall's religious artwork from later on in his life.   Worth the visit.  A very friendly dog named Toto lives in the cafe.",
          "No fan of Chagall but it's a lovely museum",
          "Best museum in Nice. Nice building and well laid out. Given that it's a bit out of the centre of town it's a pity it hasn't got a cafe.",

          "Amazing big paintings with so much color, good audio tour and an extra bonus with live music at the end. Very recommended!",
          "A beautiful museum dedicated to and designed by Chagall. Love the artist's work, and we enjoyed the museum very much!

          "This museum was the perfect setting for these Chagall works. The rooms were designed so that you had a lot of space to take in these very complex works. The narration was really well done, too. I wish the museum provided the same narration for the Song of Solomon works as they",
          "Primarily dedicated to Chagall\u2019s work with religious themes, this museum will appeal to any art lover.",
          "Great exhibition! Never enough colours and angels. Very interesting comparison of Chagall's paintings with photos and movies from the temporary exhibition of Clement Cogitore.",
          "Do not leave anything of value in your car in Nice. Lovely museum with sweet little cafe and gift shop.",
          "Super place. Beautiful light spaces, magnificent Chagall paintings (obviously) and a super temporary exhibition of Cl\u00e9ment Cogitore paired with Chagall. Excellent and very interesting. A beautiful gallery and one to return to.",
          "I\u2019m pretty familiar with Chagall\u2019s work, so this was at the top of my list for Nice. Beautiful little museum featuring works from his later years, several that were custom made for this museum and very large. Great audio guide in several languages available that is included in",
          "Chagall\u2019s own edifice which he wanted to be as much a home as a museum. Unfortunately that compromise led to the building of a soviet style concrete bunker which houses only fifteen or so of his paintings. The content consists almost entirely of works from Chagall\u2019s awful",
          "I expected a larger collection. This is a very small museum with main focus on his biblical phase. I don\u2019t recommend unless you are a huge fan and cannot miss any of his work.",
          "We were so luckly. I found the information that the museum is free on every first Sunday of the month. Yes, we were this lucky. So we waited till Sunday, and made a short walk to this museum, it's a little far from the old town, maybe 30 minutes... To be honest I'm not familiar",
          "Speaking as someone who does not feel that she is knowledgeable about art, this museum was fantastic. Chagall\u2019s paintings absolutely blew me away - primarily the beautiful colours he used, but for me the thing that made this gallery visit so interesting and awe inspiring was the",
          "We had a wonderful walk through the city to get there. It is very small but his art is so powerful. The audio guide was terrific. It takes may be an hour and a half or so. But glad we did it",
          "Such a powerful and moving collection set in lovely gardens. Cafe is expensive, but you can take a picnic. Head phones with explanations are free for each paying adult, but as kids are free they don't get which was a little irritating as we had to share hence the 4 star review.",
          "The museum itself is set on a nice hilltop, a little walk from the city center. The location is super. The collection itself is very unusual, not what you think when you think of Chagall. There was a very nice movie about the life of artist and his works; much of it was in",
          "A bright, beautiful museum with excellent examples of Chagall\u2019s work, well curated and with very good descriptions. It was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a Chagall mosaic. The cafe in the garden was well priced and pleasant as well.",
          "I\u2019ve been to many small museums this one was underwhelming. Not very well air-con\u2019ed. I feel we have more of his works in the museum in my home town than this place has. It seemed to be one period of his work and more about the exhibition who was currently on display than about",
          "The building has beeb especially designed to host Chagall's paintings which he donated to the town of Nice. It is a spacious hall which gives light and room to the exquisite art of Chagall. The artist is known in Israel for his Jewish themes but here we were free of solely",
          "A lovely visit by our family of three. We walked up the hill, which was completely doable. Alternatively, take bus 15 (which our google maps refused to acknowledge). Museum is bright and in addition to biblically inspired paintings, a lovely mosaic awaits. We liked the idea",
          "Really enjoyed the audio commentary provided. The museum brought to life Chagall\u2019s paintings and his diversity as an artist.",
          "It is a nice museum but the exhibition could be bigger. Take a bus if it is hot, to the museum some climbing. Nice cafe in the garden.",
          "Far from beach but reachable with taxi or bus is located this beautiful but rather small museum. Service was very french (slow), but finally we got in. Audioguide helps to understand paintings and is recommended. Paintings are large and beautiful. Great place to visit.",
          "Many friends visit us in Nice and many visit this museum. Even if Chagall isn't their thing they always are impressed and delighted , particularly by the building and the whole effect. So unless you really here art galleries give it a try!",
          "The guidebook captured the vision of Chagall as an artist, as did the film that was on display in the stunning auditorium. We bought the guidebook as very much amateur appreciators of art, and were very glad we did. There was plenty of seating to spend time looking at the",
          "Wonderful gallery well laid out with a range of artworks. Easy to use handsets which provided a clear outline of the work. Friendly and welcoming staff. Pleasant cafe with shade from the afternoon sun.",
          "The paintings are huge and it is Very easy to get up Close to them and take photos if you wish. We thought there would be much more about his life but there was not. The bus is just a short walk so this is easy to get to. Gardens need some work and there is. Nice cafe on the",
          "A bit of uphill and some hard stairs but well worth the effort. There were a big collection of Chagall-paintings and the audioguide gave information that made the experience great. The temperature was cool and it wasn\u2019t to crowdy even though it\u2019s tourist season. Try the caf\u00e9",
          "As an admirer of Marc Chagall I was extremely eager to visit the museum. The story, the explanations , the art were great the selection was of art was extremely limited and disappointed me. The price was a little bit high(20 euros).",
          "What a treat to see many of Marc Chagall's paintings based on scripture! They are very large, and a headphone with descriptions is offered to help one understand the thoughts behind the painting. Really enjoyed seeing and hearing all this.",
          "Highly recommended - the highlight of our trip. Headphones in englishexplaining each painting was very useful. However hour long film about Chagall's life which looked so interesting was only in french with no english subtitiles!!!",
          "This small collection of Chagall's religious paintings was a gem. I enjoyed it a lot. If you are a Chagall fan this is realy worth visiting whilst in Nice. It is easy to find - just follow the signs from Nice Ville station about 20 min walk. There is also a nice little cafe",
          "This is a small collection of Chagall\u2019s work. I liked the fact that the first paintings were of a set of Old Testament stories. ( I have seen a Chagall retrospective in Tate Liverpool and know that his subject matters are not all religious) The benefit of this gallery is that",
          "The space itself is something of a vanity piece, it seems. Stocked and arranged by the artist his own self. A multitude of religiously inspired/motivated paintings, born of Old Testament themes and trespassing occasionally and hesitantly into New territory. And a striking",
          "It's worth a visit if you're an avid Chagall fan. Not much diversity in the range of his art - mostly religious themes. I was expecting more from the collection. There is a nice cafe outside in the gardens.",
          "Nicely laid out art museum with artwork and explanations of Marc Chagall paintings. Need a couple of hours to appreciate.",
          "A litlle bit outside the very center of Nice but surely within reach on foot this fantastic museum and the exhibition of the impressive artist Marc Chagal is a must to see. To listen to the guide going through the twelve masterpieces with a bilblical theame is increaddible.",
          "My favorite part of the museum was the cafe outside, having a refreshing drink under the trees. If you're a Chagall lover, you'll go and love it. There is a theater that has a documentary on him and that is worth watching, if you're interested. There are units to carry around",
          "This museum does not display a huge number of Chagall painting, but what are on show are wonderful. These comprise a set of 12 large paintings of Old Testament scenes, most portraying somewhere views of Chagall's home town of Vitebsk. These were painted with the museum in",
          "The museum is well organised and the educational element was particularly strong. I wish the staff were more engaged. We had a power cut and their response was rather slow and not particularly professional.",
          "This is a very nice Museum dedicated to Marc Chagall. But it is small and only covers a little of his work. nice place to have a snack or lunch outside under the trees as well. Good audio guide also for free.",
          "Museum is beautiful with small collection but definitely worth seeing. Take the audio tour. easily accessible by bus",
          "None of the Chagall dynamic paintings. All very sterile religious themes. Only two rooms and a huge mosaic seen through a window that I believe someone else did to Chagall's design.",
          "Often Art Galleries have too many paintings, you scurry round, not really looking properly and never getting as much out of experience as you should. This is different. There are twelve main paintings in a purpose built room, all depicting stories from Old Testament - don't",
          "It\u2019s worth going here. The setting is lovely and the gallery is a lovely space. The content is very specific - religious works - but there\u2019s plenty to see of the master\u2019s work.",
          "Even those who are not connoisseurs of fine art will find much to enjoy in this museum dedicated to Marc Chagall. The museum layout provides ample external light to highlight the many works housed in the national museum. To enjoy this museum best, rent the handheld audio",
          "This was a wonderful museum. Chagall was an amazing artist. This museum seemed to have a bit of a religious theme. Many beautiful pieces of Chagall's art is featured here. It is not a very large museum so it wasn't overwhelming. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",
          "amazing art, vibrant and colourful one of the stops when you going on the Nice tour bus.great gift shop.",
          "This is a great museum. Chagall's work is colourful and intriguing. It's a good-sized collection - enough to be worth the visit, not too much so you get saturated. Finally, the collection is focused on one aspect of his work, and the audioguide is extremely well done.",
          "If you are in Nice, don't miss this museum. Chagall's paintings are stunning. They are beautifully presented in a large room. The free audio guide really enhances the experience.",
          "Plenty of Chagall to view. Loved seeing so many original, not to be seen elsewhere but books. Formally, a Chicago native (I am) always admiring the First National Bank (years ago) and now Chase Tower's Four Seasons mosaic by Marc Chagall (1974). This just cemented my love of",
          "Located in the hills overlooking Nice. Bright, airy space with a great collection of Chagall\u2019s biblical scenes and stained glass. Spend of few minutes before the visit to read the brief history behind his biblical pieces. Can easily take in the entirety of the museum in 90",
          "Chagal is one of my favorite painters and has a worldwide reputation. This museum has a wonderful collection of Chagal's paintings, including some in styles I had never seen before. Because I am familiar both with the biblical stories that inspired the paintings and with",
          "We enjoyed this museum, not too big and the audio guide was helpful. We walked from the town centre following the signs - it took about 20 /25 minutes, but a number 15 bus from the centre stops outside.",
          "Have seen lots of Chagall\u2019s work but it was a lovely Museum with an outdoor Cafe. A good walk up from the town centre. Paintings and stained glass work. You could sit in the Garden too. Perfect.",
          "I found the works to be very emotional, and I'm not religious, but it is hard not to be swept away by the beauty and intricacy of these pieces. Venue is starkly imposing, yet inviting. Loved the architecture. The mosaic wall was truly mind boggling to me. As well, I was very",
          "Great museum, lunch in the garden with the locals, but take the bus, not your rental car. We parked there in late May and came out to find our rental car vandalized and a few items stolen. When we exchanged the car, we were told that every rental car that was vandalized had",
          "Started with lunch under the olive trees. Very nice. Then the exhibition in rooms dedicated to the art. Fantastic colourful paintings from the exodus",
          "This museum is really made of his 11 biblical paintings and a couple of others. Its a long, uphill walk from Nice and we're mostly glad we went, but once you start going to museums in Paris - this one fades away as one you could have definitely skipped. True fans will want to",
          "Must see! Rare occasion to view Chagal's work in periodic order. Nice cafe too and a good shop. Take a walk there!",
          "As an admirer of this artist it is hard to give an objective opinion of this museum. Outside there is a garden green and flowers all over before you come to the entrance. Then there is a huge room with his paintings, nearly overwhelmed with his art. It must just be seen to",
          "We have a couple of Chagall originals from the Fables de la Fontaine series, in black & white, of which we are very fond. The two pieces do however pale dramatically when seeing the works shown in the Chagall museum in Nice. Most f them with a religious motif, and strongly",
          "Finding most of the museum closed (installing a new exhibit?) was disappointing despite the free entry. The dozen or so large paintings were interesting, and so was the film about his life and his generation of artists, but that was all there to see - plus the famous mosaic...",
          "I would say it was a waste of time, but we spent there only around 10 minutes in total - that\u2019s how small the exhibition is. I counted 14 paintings of Chagall and these paintings were not impressive at all. The temporary exhibition of some young modern artist which took the",
          "I was looking forward to this as an expected highlight, so it was disappointing to see such a limited range of works, mainly religious which aren\u2019t my favourites. Lovely gallery, and very helpful staff. \u20ac10 entry. Silly system where you pay for the ticket by the shop, and then",
          "While they did give us a discounted ticket price and warned that there was remodeling going on in the museum, we didn't realize the extent of the closures until we were in. Feels like with museum being half closed, we should have paid half the price.",
          "Very nice, quite small, and can be crowded. It was free the day I went so that was a bonus, you should understand the reason Chagall painted this series it will help you appreciate it better. There are audio devices to tell the story, and they are very inexpensive at only 2 euro",
          "The Great artist and The Great museum. I learned about Chagal and saw many but this is the best. To recommend to get the audio giude. Strongly recommend.",
          "We learned about the artist, but expected more of his art. This is a single story building that proves personal audio devices and a movie about Chagall's life.",
          "The museum is a gem! If you are a fan of Chagall's--and even if you aren't, his works are displayed beautifully and the museum itself is full of light. But, be sure to check times of when different areas of the museum are closed off--our mistake, not theirs! Fortunately, we were",
          "Incredibly beautiful Chagall paintings. This is a small museum, but the paintings exhibited are breathtaking.",
          "Came here on Easter Sunday. Lovely museum. Not too big and very airy. Nice cafe in the garden too where you can get a drink. Enjoyable outing in a beautiful area of nice. We walked there from central nice and some of the houses on the way are spectacular.",
          "Highly recommend the audio guide as it provides a deeper appreciation of his paintings. Lovely gallery, quite small but enough to see. Picturesque cafe (a little pricey), nice shop. Above all, a very interesting insight into Chagall and his life.",
          "Well worth seeing. Quite a lot of his religious paintings, a room of his gorgeous circus paintings, some ceramics and the harmonica that he painted in an auditorium where you can hear a concert if you are lucky.",
          "On my two previous visits to this museum I had been absolutely bowled over, and was very much looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with Chagall and his work. Unfortunately, the Song of Songs room was closed, so I didn't see everything I had viewed previously. What I did",
          "Had the chance to stop by the Marc Chagall Museum. Great experience and wonderful works of art. Only wish it was on the museum pass which allows you to get into many of the other museums in Nice w/o paying additional entrance fees.",
          "This museum has a beautiful architecture and a magnificent colection of the Bible stories by Chagall. Art lovers - do not miss. Yona S.",
          "Not impressive at all. The selection of paintings is disappointing, all together Chagal is not a great artist, If you want to visit a museum in Nice just visit Matisse's ad don't waste your time on Chagal",
          "Hiked up from the trolley and was happy we did. Beautiful grounds which enhance the content within. If you\u2019re a fan of Chagall, this museum is a must. Beautiful works.",
          "Amazing to see Chagall's Biblical masterpieces. Free audio guides explain the meaning, nuance and symbolism of his work.",
          "Paid full price for half of the museum then to be closed for 2 hours barely 20 minutes later. At no point did any of the staff mention this was going to happen - very poor. Reduced rate if you entered at the time but no refund if you had already paid full price!",
          "The Chagall museum is a gem. The collection of his Biblical themed paintings are beautifully presented. There is a very informative documentary of Marc Chagall which provides context for the viewer. Thoroughly enjoyable. Worth the walk up to Cimiez!",
          "Chagall developed as an artist as he got older and there are examples of all his work here: painting, sculpture and stained glass. His themes are often biblical, though early on he was a fashionable painter of people and still life. This is definitely worth a trip to see.",
          "This museum was designed by Chagall. Fabulous Biblical themes. The mosaic was most memorable to me. Afterwards we sipped Rose at the little cafe on the grounds. A sunny March day with a cool breeze. Spiritual, peaceful, enjoyable.",
          "Beautiful museum specialising in Chagall's paintings of Biblical stories. Set in gardens with a place to eat in the grounds. Visiting here was definitely one of the highlights of our time in Nice.",
          "If you like art generally, or modern art, or Chagall's art, then this is must see if you visit Nice. The gallery space is well suited to Chagall's large art. It's a good collect of his work. It's an inexpensive museum. $8 Euros admission. Easy to get to on the City Bus and",
          "Nice little building in a park in Nice. Not a large collection so a bit disappointing. The film on Chagall's life was well done and enjoyable. It's true I am jaded because I am a Chicagoan and we have a powerful Chagall collection in our Art Institute. ( Particularly the",
          "This is a lovely building which shows off its exhibits well. The items are well spaced out so easy to absorb despite the clamour of school children",
          "Lovely building and location for an important collection of larger format works by the much beloved artist, a must-see if in Nice.",
          "Really had no idea of the biblical scope of Chagall's work and this museum it one of my favorites! Would be a great trip for children to see who can find all of the objects that Chagall puts into almost every painting!",
          "This elegant building displays Chagall\u2019s art dramatically and sympathetically and allows the visitor to fully appreciate Chagall\u2019s genius for composition and the use of colour. Apart from the wonderful paintings, there are examples of Chagall\u2019s mosaics, pottery and , in the",
          "You will need at least 60 minutes to get into the mind of this surrealist painter. The film helps you understand a whole lot more about the man. Don't miss the mosaic reflected in the pool, showing reality upside down.",
          "Only Chagall works. Very doable in an hour. Great audio included in entry fee. Best way from centre is by Uber (\u20ac6). All works just stunning.",
          "We had a most enjoyable visit to the Musee Marc Chagall recently. To get there, you can take the bus to Cimiez or, as we did, walk there from downtown Nice. The main focus of the museum is the gallery of Biblical scenes. Here there are several large paintings of Biblical themed",
          "The exhibit is small but paintings are beautiful and the building has a great design. The building was designed to feel more like a home than an institution and it does. The rooms are feel like large living rooms. A good place to visit. The walk to and back from old town is",
          "Really enjoyed having the free audioguide, in English, as I wandered and sat in the large rooms to view the biblical series, and the 5 Song of Songs paintings. The 52 minute movie, alternately in French and English also provided a look at this remarkable artist, and the",
          "This is a wonderful, quick to cover Musee of this popular artist. Found the Biblical Message Painting very interesting. Took the artist 13 years to complete. Worth a few hours of your time.",
          "The museum has a very good collection of large religious Chagall painting along with other aspects of his like. The 8\u20ac entrance fee includes a portable guide provided you have a passport or driving licence. Nothing else would do. Utter pointless bureaucracy and a couldn\u2019t care",
          "I have always loved Chagall\u2019s work and never more so than in this museum. The building is set in grounds with a small outdoor cafe where olive trees shimmer in the breeze. Chagall supervised the placement and hanging of the majority of the works, and a mosaic visible from two",
          "The Musee Marc Chagall is just wonderful. Understanding that the artist oversaw the construction of the building and the placement of the art is a marvel. January was a wonderful time to visit as there were not many people and I could actually SEE the paintings and understand, a",
          "Good selection of works on display. Self guided recorded tour available. Can get very crowded. Entrance fee is also rather expensive compared with other galleries in the town with a greater offering of works. However, if you are a fan of Chagall\u2019s work, then this is not to be",
          "Complicated, huge, nearly every meaningful event in the human history happening at the same time and at the same place - here in his paintings! Don't be in a rush! He's got the time machine - he'll bring you whichever place you want to be! Of course if you have got the same",
          "The powerful colours of Chagalls paintings are very impressing, his way to interprete biblical motifs leads to a new understanding.",
          "This is a very lovely small museum of Chaghall's work whilst living in Nice. An excellent shop, toilets, and cafe also.",
          "I love Chagall and was delighted to be surrounded by his ingenious creations. Biblical content for the most part, the enormous paintings are full of energy, colors and his usual symbolism. I spent a wonderful couple of hours!",
          "Super museum with excellent audio guide. This museum was easy to find, not crowded and simply delightful. Loved it.",
          "they have a really extensive collection of artifacts and mordern art.. get really confusing in between but a good time pass place if you love art",
          "Confusion in our group of friends about arrangements resulted in us arriving too late to be admitted the museum. Two us had been before and this was to be an additional treat seeing what in my view is one of the loveliest galleries. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t to be on this",
          "if you think you know Chagall quite well, be ready - after visiting the sacred place you have a feeling as if lightning of art has struck you. It would be advisable to take a crash-course in the Bible-studies,so you can enjoy his painitings and get the message better. I started",
          "The museum is interesting because it was built during Chagall's lifetime, and so he had a lot of input to the architecture of the building. It was built primarily to house a series of religious works he painted that depict events in the Torah. However, his more famous works are",
          "This wonderful artist has left a legacy collection for us all to enjoy. The setting is beautiful, the paintings well displayed. Very sadly the staff are so rude and unpleasant it made our visit a little bit sour. With 5pm as the advertised close time, the admission clerk",
          "The museum is outdated and not English friendly. Construction underway, ticket staff not inviting or setting an expectation of interest.",
          "Wonderful museum. The audioguide is essential because Chagall's paintings are so complex. You will come away with an understanding of the subjects he uses. Because we visited in the off-season, we were able to step back from these large works and view them in their entirety.",
          "This museum is well done (this might be due to the fact that Chagall himself helped plan it). I\u2019m not a huge fan of his work, but I learned so much about him and his paintings at this museum that he has grown on me. The audio guide was informative and I recommend borrowing one.",
          "I last visited here in April 2013 and seized the chance to visit again en-route to the Cinque Terre from Southern France. The staff are disinterested but that does not affect the gallery at all in my opinion. The centre peice of the Gallery is the biblical works from Genesis and",
          "disappointing one may see much more in Paris at 10 euros each expensive. a great deal of empty space",
          "We arrived and there was no admission charge as only the permanent exhibit was open. Chagall's works of art were displayed well, were numerous, and had English explanation beside them. The Cafe in the garden had good choice for food and drinks and the gift shop had some",
          "It is often striking, as a North Amreican, how often you see European parents explaining art to their children in places like this. it is also encouraging to see how many young people choose to make museums such as this one a place they want to visit. The paintings are huge,",
          "Truly a fantastic museum dedicated to Marc Chagall. The collection is extraordinary and there is a must see documentary about Chagall and his work. Best museum in Nice?",
          "Somehow after the Matisse museum I thought there would be only a few paintings but was blown away by the selection many of which were unknown to me. A very good documentary about Chagall's life as well. A good museum shopand a very pleasant snack bar in the gardens to top it all.",
          "I wasn't quite sure what to expect but was truly a revelation. Chagall was a painter with imense talent. His collected work is displayed in a 1950s style modernist house and garden Well worth a visit. Allow a couple of hours to see it properly, even though its not huge.",
          "Masterpieces. Use the audio guides - so helpful. Go to the restroom before heading to the building with the art - no restrooms at the latter.",
          "Small museum with beautiful paintings & helpful audioguides. The place was a little hard to find but the visit was well worth it.",
          "My main reason for going to Nice and it was soooo much better than my high expectations!!! It was my first viewing ofChagall paintings every and the vibrancy and content moved me to tears... So expressive, so beautiful....",
          "If you enjoy Chagall's religious art you should definitely stop by. The cost is 10 euros per person and the museum has an extensive collection of his later works.",
          "I\u2019m a fan of Chagall and it was interesting to know he had a hand in the layout. Most works are biblical in theme and include paintings, drawings, a mosaic and stained glass. There was an installation in progress so the whole museum wasn\u2019t open, but that allowed me more time",
          "Worth the trek up through the lovely neighborhood of hills! It is a beautiful space and the artwork is breathtaking! Very easy to do in a short time.",
          "What a disappointment to pay FULL TICKET PRICE and just get to see the 3 rooms with the religious paintings of Chagall. The rest of the museum was closed off with a note \"Closed for Technical Reasons\". All of us standing there protested and the staff said, \"Well they should",
          "Well, for me to give this museum a 5* rating is amazing. I usually enjoy works no later than the 16th century, but Chagall did so many paintings with prominent stories from the Bible that were amazing. With your entrance fee, you get an audio. This is one of the best I have",
          "Amazing art from Chagall and great cafe with lovely friendly staff and good food. Very wheelchair friendly and helpful staff. You can purchase an audio guide in English.",
          "Holds the world\u2019s largest collection of Chagall\u2019s work. This museum is amazing! Chagall lived in St-Paul-de-Vence (close to Nice) the last 38 years of his life. He painted 17 large murals designed for and donated to this museum. These paintings was inspired by the biblical",
          "As my husband is a fan of Chagall I went expecting something special. very disappointing visit. 2 roooms were closed and the whole visit took no more than 30 minutes. Nothing from Chagall's life or earlier works. No access to his house or personal artefacts you would normally",
          "Impressive collection of Chagall paints (totally different from other paints you might find in other museums). Knowing bible might support understand better the paints.",
          "It was interesting, just long enough, with a fun store at the end and great terrace for a coffee. WE went during the morning hours and it was not busy..",
          "The Musee Chagall is outstanding: Abraham and the Three Angels, The Sacrifice of Isaac,The Creation, Driven from Paradise, and Chagall\u2019s The great mosaic are on display. The audio guide, which is included with the admission price, is excellent.",
          "Before seeing the paintings, watch the movie about this artist. You will understand the ideas behind his art better and it will help you to appreciate Chagall's works at its most. I wish there were works he created earlier.",
          "This museum is out of town so we got there by Uber from our hotel. A large purpose built space to display much of his Biblical art, relatively peaceful first thing in the morning. The highlights for me were the stained glass in the concert hall room (which shows short films",
          "An outstanding museum with stunning examples of Chagall\u2019s paintings. The museum building was purpose built to display his works and is charming and peaceful. We used the #15 bus to get there - the stop is just a few steps away. We also went to the cafe in the grounds. A perfect",
          "Extraordinary examples of his Religious Works in a very beautiful structure and atmosphere. A must see for any visit to Nice.",
          "This did not disappoint. Chagall is an old favourite but these majestic works took it to a new level. The (freak) audio guide is excellent. Each picture is worth lengthy review. The building itself is an additional delight. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "This museum offered the right amount of art and commentary in a wonderful location. I liked the audio commentary as it really explained everything very completely. The art itself was phenomenal = so vivid and colorful and so much to see. Could have spent hours in this museum.",
          "I'm not a great fan of Chagall and this is a museum of his religious art. It's not my forte and certainly wasn't worth the trip up the hill to see. The chapel with some of stained glass was impressive. I didn't spend 20 minutes here.",
          "Highly recommend if you are interested in the work of Chagall, and the Bible study series. Probably the most significant collection of Chagall\u2019s most important works. Nice cafe with delicious food and terrific service outside in the garden area.",
          "We had the most wonderful guide who really brought this fascinating and talented artist to life. It was the highlight of our trip!",
          "Went to the museum yesterday. It has not changed, as far as we could tell, since our last visit several years ago. If you are a fan of his work, definitely worth the visit.",
          "This museum was certainly my highlight of all the art museums we visited while in the south of France. If you aren't a Chagall admirer, you will be by the time you leave.",
          "More than I expected. I do like Chagall, especially for his color. The works were displayed magnificently and the contextual information was very enhancing, as well. Definitely a must see, when in Nice.",
          "The Chagall museum is a gem. Chagall\u2019s beautiful paintings on multiple media are enhanced by their surroundings. The museum is an ideal size and I had enough time to see everything without having to rush. It was a highlight of my two week stay in Nice.",
          "Please use the headphones. There is so much to learn about his painting here. The one museum to see while visiting the south of France. The museum store is very nice and very reasonably priced. Either before you go inside or after be sure to stop by the outdoor cafe. The food",
          "Marc Chagall museum is the first French museum built for a living artist. Chagall was involved in the planning of the museum due to the size and shape of several paintings that are large and wanted natural light. His series of paintings are called \u201c The Biblical Message\u201d. They",
          "It\u2019s a hike up a hill if you\u2019re walking but you can take the #15 bus there (and further to the Matisse museum). The museum is fairly small but has about 6 rooms of his art and photos. There\u2019s also a movie running of his life. It\u2019s a great find and only 10 euros to get in.",
          "Wow. Must see museum of fantastic art. Soak up the vibrancy, you\u2019ll not be disappointed. If you only get chance to see one museum in Nice make it this one.",
          "Being a fan of Marc Chagall's art, I wanted to see this museum on my visit to Nice. It was a wonderful experience and the artist was alive at it's dedication. Most of the art is Chagall's later works where he was interpreting scenes from the Old Testament. There are also some",
          "This museum was by far the best we have visited in all our travels. The headphones helped with explanations of Chagall's work. Definitely a must to see in Nice.",
          "A very special museum, the first to be devoted to an artist in their lifetime. A stunning collection of Chagall's works and absolutely worth a visit. Lovely caf\u00e9 in the gardens, with tables and seating in the shade, perfect on hot, sunny days.",
          "I was really stunned. these oversize paintings on the Biblical stories were just unbelievable. i have seen a lot of his paintings around but the museum is really worth visiting. You may also learn about the creation of the world. Chagall was a really cool chap and please, visit",
          "This was a wonderful little find! For only \u20ac10 you can see the vast collection of pieces from Chagall. I had not heard of this artist before, but his work is stunning and worth seeing. Also, the museum is situated in a nice residential area of the city which adds to its charm.",
          "If you like this artist you can experience many paintings, stained glass or a great mosaic created during his long life. There is also a small concert hall with a movie about the Marc Chagall. Your 24h or 7days museum pass is not valid in this museum. Everyone has to pay \u20ac10.-",
          "best place in the entire art world. large canvasses on white walls. breathtaking simply to walk in the space knowing what chagall did to create these masterpieces. l o v e",
          "Great visit. Free audio guide with admission. Student discount of 2 euro. 10euro for adults. Wonderfully laid out.",
          "Small museum dedicated to Chagall. We spent about one hour, which was enough. Cost \u20ac10 which seemed reasonable to me. Good selection of paintings and drawings, but not so many that it was overwhelming. We knew a bit about Chagall, but we still managed to learn a bit more. We",
          "We spent many hours here. Chagall is fascinating and there was a short but excellent film about the artist at the museum. Chagall designed the museum himself and he donated all of the paintings in it to the French state.",
          "This is a small museum. We spent under an hour. But every moment was breathtaking. Just up the hill you will find Mus\u00e9e Matisse. It\u2019s a larger exhibit.",
          "Not the biggest or largest museum to visit but good for a nice look around, perfect for kids since it is not to big and offers a nice coffeshop in the garden outside. Nice paintings even though I prefer the Picasso-museum in Antibes.",
          "The museum is situated in a nice quartier on a hill.It was a good surprise ,Musee Chagall met our expectations, a really good arts hour spended.",
          "Use the same bus to visit the Chagall Museum and the Matisse museum. The Chagall Museum is a beautiful modern space with a vast number of his drawings and paintings and he lived to open it himself. Unlike most French museums it has a small cafe. Further up the hill the Matisse",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to Musee National Marc Chagall. The collection is a manageable size and includes a cohesive body of large scale work. Sometimes museums for well known artists contain a lesser known potluck of unconnected work that can be interesting but uninspiring to",
          "Spent 2 1/2 hours here this past Thursday. One of the best museums I visited in France. Not too big, super well-curated. Loved it.",
          "One of the most interesting museums I visited. Also in their restaurant I ate the BEST Tarte Tatin in my life!",
          "Yes if you are interested in art and Chagall, you better make a visit. Nice painting from Chagalls early time, not so many flying goats but colorful and good. Nice open museum.",
          "If you like Chagall's work this is a must see place. Even our kids (not big fans of the arts) seemed to enjoy themselves.",
          "Please make sure you see the free movie before seeing the paintings. It really gives your perspective on his life and works. Great museum. Beautiful grounds.",
          "As one of the first museums dedicated to a single artist and the first to open in a living artist\u2019s lifetime, Chagall was ahead of the curve. And at the same time working in a style that for the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s seemed rather old fashion. I, surprisingly, had not seen this",
          "Nice chance to see & learn a lot about Chagall. The museum is well organized, the building and grounds are nice with lots of lavender flowers for color and scent's. My family and I found this museum more interesting than Matisse museum.",
          "Second visit. This is a colourful gem. Very good audio in English. Lovely place to have a drink or lunch too.",
          "I visited the Musee National Marc Chagall in July 2018. You can get there by taking Bus 15 from near Les Galleries Lafayette and Place Massena. It is about a 15-minute ride. Once inside the museum, you can watch a one-hour movie about Marc Chagall. The centerpiece of the",
          "Chagall is my favourite painter. His museum blew me away . I had forgotten to take an I D with me so could not borrow the free commentary on headphones, but I did not miss it. I could soak in the vibrant colours of each painting and loved them all . The 1 hour film I watched",
          "This small museum blew me and my wife away. Marc Chagall is my favorite modern artist, but I was awed by the presentation of these bright masterpieces. The free audioguide is amazing. Before you leave, grab a sugar crepe and a glass of wine wine in the charming garden cafe.",
          "It was a bit rainy so decided to look for a museum. Wanted the photgraphy one but it wasn\u2019t open on this day so went here instead and was not disappointed at all. Used google maps to walk to it and the walk itself was part of the experience. Very interesting artist and",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the childhood home of Napoleon Bonaparte which has been made into a museum of aspects of his life. As others have reported there is no English interpretative signage but we managed with minimal French and thought it was worth a visit.",
          "The gallery has fabulous works by Chagall and an extremely comfortable cinema where they show a film about his life. The gallery is in large grounds which include a pretty cafe in gardens. I had a really good meal there. A lovely experience all round. But just to warn, if",
          "This museum is a must visit if you\u2019re in Nice. The artwork is in an amazing space designed by Chagall himself. It encompasses a wide array of his works and some of his best masterpieces. The audioguide was extremely well narrated and easy to follow, even for young children. I",
          "I had seen some of Chagall\u2019s work over the years so was pleasantly surprised to discover that Nice has a museum dedicated to him. Entrance fee was 10\u20ac so I didn\u2019t expect Le Louvre. There are around a hundred pieces of Chagall\u2019s work with varying degrees of impact. What does",
          "Love it or not Chagall's style, this museum and his works are impressive. Mostly religious subjects with hundreds of tiny details on each of the paintings - very complex and deep stories. Highly recommended.",
          "The exhibit is small but only very good works are presented here. There was literally nothing reminding about his Vitebsk period, with people drifting in the air. A very interesting movie is currently sown in the movie room.",
          "interesting place which must see everyone! beautiful inside we visited cafe for to discuss what have we saw",
          "Visited the Marc Chagall museum in Nice last week and really enjoyed it! I would highly recommend using the free audio guide as it gives the visitor a better understanding of his work. The museum is relatively small so one could easily spend about 1-2 hours there and see it all.",
          "Loved this museum. I especially loved the theatre which introduces Chagall in a more intimate light. Audio guide is free so definitely worth it. I personally could have spent hours here but did not have the time. The cafe outside is worth it for a quick lunch. There was only one",
          "I visited the Chagall museum in June of 2018. I must admit that I\u2019m not really a fan of Chagall since I don\u2019t really know much about him but I really I enjoyed this museum. It is very small, without an audio guide, you can tour the entire thing in 20 mins or less. The paintings",
          "Beautifully laid out and although a lot of people were there during our visit it did not seem crowded. The natural lighting is superb. The staff were helpful and the cafe is worth a visit",
          "This retrospective covers Chagall's career. It was assembled by Chagall himself, and the building was designed to offer a more intimate approach to his work. It was roomy and not crowded. The progression of some of his artworks was documented by sketches and preliminary",
          "The museum in the neigbourhood of Cimiez, on the hills of Nice is worth visiting for three reasons. Because it holds Chagall's most important biblical works, because Cimiez off the main tourist trail is a tranquil oasis with beautiful buildings, gardens and panaromic views and",
          "The building itself and the history of the artist and museum were interesting. A little smaller than I expected. Found some of the artists work appealing, but that is art, not everyone likes everything.",
          "The Museum is great, Chagall paintings are large, colorful and intriguing. The English commentary is very good. Please note that you should be quite skeptical when reading any TA reviews as they rarely publish a negative review because doing so will hurt profits. Note that the",
          "This is the French National museum built specifically to house a collection of paintings by Marc Chagall. The building itself is an fine example of mid century architecture. The audio tour is especially helpful in proving invaluable background information about Chagall's life",
          "Wow factor going in. Exhibit quite small & cost for entry high for such a small place. It was well placed & airy. The largeness didn\u2019t make up for limited pieces",
          "Art was nice but building needs repairs and maintenance. Building needs paint and grounds full of weeds and dirt not worthy of artist of this level. Should be better maintained. Staff not the friendliest either except for guides and gift shop cashier. Was not worth the trip or",
          "Amazing paintings and Museum. Parking was horrible but we forgot all about it once we immersed ourselves in the galleries. The museum cafe was also great... get the Samosa salad.... among the best samosas I\u2019ve had. The museum is small and very manageable. Cost was 20",
          "Chagall's Bible works are brilliantly displayed in this small museum. They're gorgeous and to be able to see them in a place specifically dedicated to him was just amazing.",
          "Chagall's spirit is very much alive in the Museum that was built in his name and to his memory. This is especially poignant since he is buried at nearby St Paul de Vence. The Museum is up on the hillside above Nice, so you will need a car, taxi or bike to get there. Walking",
          "This is a fabulous museum many original paintings. The audio guide tour which is about one hour was most helpful. Highly recommend!",
          "Resist the temptation to hurry to the next painting before the description in the audioguide is finished. Unlike some museums in which the audioguide can be dull, tedious and even tangential to the art, this audioguide is integral to the museum and really enhances the sensation.",
          "A great couple of hours spent 'en familie' in this museum, thoroughly recommended. The museum is a nice walk from the town centre, but a bit hilly if you have any trouble walking. Nice gift shop, tea room and gardens too. Well worth a visit.",
          "Wonderful small museum highlighting Chagall. Very nice gift shop and gardens. Went as part of a group, and had limited time, but the museum can be seen easily in an hour or two.",
          "I really didn\u2019t know Chagall before I went. His work is beautiful. Such colors! I am a musician and I really like his portrayal of music, instruments, and song.",
          "Whilst this style of painting wasn't for me, its still worth visiting just for the history and to see the paintings in there \"place\". My wife found it more interesting than me to be honest, and she loved it.",
          "This museum was one of the things to do in Nice so we decided to go. I hadn\u2019t heard about Chagall before and I have to say I very much enjoyed his modern paintings on biblical concepts. It is fairy small but very interesting. The audio guide helps you understand all details.",
          "First of all - don\u2019t take the bus here. Walk. You should use the audio guide (free, but you have to leave either a drivers license or your passport when you borrow the equipment). Nice toilet. Many beautiful paintings, and a nice outdoor area. Recommended!",
          "We never knew about Chagall until we visited this museum. We enjoyed the audio and the collection at the museum.",
          "This is a fabulous small museum! If you want to derive the most out of it pencil in plenty of time. We watched the wonderful movie about Chagall with footage of him talking about his extraordinary long life. It is 50 minutes long. The audio guide - free of charge- is a must to",
          "What makes this so special is that it was designed around a particulat theme. The architecture is stark and from sone vantage points looking outside one could be in Israel. A profoundly moving collection and using an electronic guide is a must to help you get the most from each",
          "Such a marvellous collection of Chagall's work. Do take the time to watch the movie as it tell the wonderful story of his life.",
          "We did not know or appreciate Chagall\u2019s effect in the art world until this visit. The film of some 45 minutes and the 13 artworks demonstrate his impact. Lots of colour despite the religious themes. Worth a visit.",
          "I did not even expect the museum would have such a full collection of Chagall paintings. Was really impressed. It is so worthy to visits.",
          "I had known nothing of Chagall\u2019s religious work beforehand and so this museum was a surprise (I\u2019d expected a broad collection of his work) and a very pleasant one. The scale of his paintings were huge and the vibrancy of his use of colour brought his use of symbolism and subject",
          "A modest though beautiful museum, this spot allows a unrushed look at a famous and unique artist. If you have time, there is a 50-minute video in the concert hall (which also has stained-glass windows) that depicts through Chagall\u2019s own words much of his career and artistic",
          "The best of Chagall, according to the D.O. The paintings were exquisite, there was a sensational film (be sure to get there for the one in English), the stained glass was marvelous.",
          "Chagall is my favorite however, even if he is not yours, make sure to go to the museum. The colors alone are worth going. Spectacular works, just awe inspiring.",
          "Wonderful collection of Chagall\u2019s religious art. Watch the movie in English to set the stage for the collection. Nice outdoor snack area for coffee, wine or beer, as well as a light snack.",
          "My wife and I decided to visit both the Matisse and Chagall museums during our visit to Nice. We took a taxi to the Matisse museum first and then walked down the hill to the Chagall Museum and as she said we did them in the right order. The Chagall museum is an amazing place",
          "We were told to take the tram a few stops and then walk the rest, however the rest is a constant climb up a series of steps, which proved quite a task",
          "This is a wonderful museum and should not be missed if you are interested in art. There is an English language film (showing at 1 & 3pm when we were there) which we missed so could only see it in French, how I wished that there were subtitles!",
          "Enough art to keep you interested in a pleasant surrounding. Well worth the visit if you are a lover of art, especially Chagall's.",
          "It really seems they designed the museum around the collection. Displays are beautiful and breath-taking. Our only complaint was that some of the signage was only in French.",
          "Not a lot of places like that one . It's in a cosy place with wonderful exposition , big spaces allow to have a exeptional time with Mr Chagall .",
          "We went to the museum on the advice of a friend who had visited it years ago--it was her only \"must see\" in Nice. Absolutely loved this small museum and could have happily stayed all afternoon soaking up Chagall's vivid colors and imagery. The artist actively participated in",
          "Most things in Nice are quite close to the city center and it is worthwhile walking here, even taking into consideration some steep hills and steps. The museum holds a wonderful collection of some of his works and an informative film plays in the cinema.",
          "We went to this art museum yesterday for the first time in 12 years. Wow! We should have gone back more often. To appreciate what a great artist Chagall was you need to see the works displayed here. The gallery was built during his lifetime (he lived for 98 years) to house the",
          "A nice museum with not too many Chagall paintings. Many seem to be out on loan elsewhere. Still, what\u2019s on display is worth it. Fortunately, there is a film documenting the artist\u2019s life, so the overall impression is positive.",
          "A very nice gallery, not far from the center of Nice. Located in a garden with a romantic caf\u00e9. The collection is splendid, covering the painter's most important productions. I especially enjoyed the audio-guide that was part of the entrance-fee. It added a lot to the experience",
          "Some rooms were closed off due to renovations, but the visit was still 100% worth it just for the cycle of biblically inspired paintings.",
          "Lovely purpose-built museum (designed partly by the artist himself) in a very interesting part of town. If you like Chagall\u2019s art it\u2019s a must see. The collection is not that varied in terms of style, majoring on his biblical images, but there\u2019s more than enough to enthrall any",
          "You will be blown away by the large format paintings at the Chagall Museum. Also, the stained glass story filling the entire side of the auditorium is breath taking. This museum is not to be missed during your stay in Nice!",
          "Located in a nice neighborhood, the museum gives good overview of the Chagall\u2019s art. What was curious? Stained glass made by him and clavesine decorated by him in the hall. Nice little park outside to have a cup of coffee.",
          "Incredible display of art. It is displayed in a building I believe was designed by the artist. Huge paintings on display that you can really get close to which I enjoy.",
          "Used the audio-tour to walk through the exhibit, which was a wonderful and specific exhibit of certain of Chagall's religious themed paintings.",
          "I did not have much exposure to Chagall prior to this visit. This is a fantastic collection and is well worth a visit. I was blown away.",
          "This is Chagall at his mystical best. Chagall's images bring the Old Testament's tales to life with a magnificent vibrance. These splendid, massive oils were meant to be shown as a set, and collectively they bath the museum in the light of age old myth that still animates the",
          "Definitely worth a visit. I only subtracted a star because I would have liked to see a greater range of his paintings. However, this series of religious paintings is beautifully presented. It is worth pointing out that the documentary film of Chagall\u2019s life comes in different",
          "It is a beautiful museum a bit further from the center of the Town, but it is really worth your time and a good opportunity to escape from crowded areas and streets, to wonder around beautiful buildings and trees. The museum is in a quiet place and it is quite small, but really",
          "Well worth the walk out of town even on a warm good Friday. The building is a finely executed piece of cool modernism which shows off the works to very good effect. The religious theme of most of the works was particularly appropriate, including wonderful stained glass in the",
          "A collection of some wonderful paintings and other art works (don\u2019t miss the stained glass windows) on a biblical theme. Certainly gave us a different insight into his work that we hadn\u2019t appreciated before. Friendly staff both in the museum and nearby cafe make this an easy",
          "Very absorbing exhibits. We had no ID on us so couldn\u2019t get the free audio guide. Bought a book for \u20ac8 but it didn\u2019t correspond well with the placement of the paintings.",
          "This purpose-buit museum, built during the life of Marc Chagall and with his input to design and layout, is a fabulous location to spend half a day if you appreciate Chagall's style.",
          "Outstanding collection of Chagall\u2019s work. The audio guide is a must, it greatly enhanced my experience. Misses a star because it can get very busy, and flow through the museum leads to everyone being in the main room for an extended period of time.",
          "Most museums or galleries dedicated to an artist are very sycophantic towards their subject; not the Marc Chagall museum. It takes a humble perspective towards Chagall's work and displays some of his finest work in a wonderful collection that allows it to fully breathe. As you",
          "A beautiful building but not the most enjoyable experience. Not my favourite type of Chagall work. I would have like more background information about Chagall and his work - not that impressed with the curation.",
          "I'm amazed by these reviews. I've read them again after seeing the museum because it's one of the most disappointing museum I've ever seen. I've been all over Europe and visited a lot. But this? No idea. 20 euro for a very small exhibition, the movie wasn't working, and the art",
          "We really enjoyed the museum and some of our group thought it would be boring. It was a pleasant surprise for all of us! The paintings were thoroughly interesting as the were both contemporary, but told biblical stories in unusual ways. The listening devices really made",
          "This is a unique museum celebrating a singular talent. Even the non-religious will experience the power of faith.",
          "I had seen a few of Chagall\u2019s works in books, but after seeing them at the museum, I am astonished! They take my breath away. Chagall is probably my favorite Artist now!",
          "Hard to find it, but interesting museum, with the world largest collection of Marc Chagall paintings.",
          "We loved our visit today. Fabulous art. Hung beautifully. Good guide notes. We almost had the gallery to ourselves which made it very special. Nice cafe. Good shop. Helpful staff. Might be worth checking about school visits. Just as we were leaving about 30 - lovely! -",
          "We wouldn't come to Nice without paying our respects to this purpose built shrine to Chagall's work on biblical themes. The film shown in English and French versions is as touching as it is informative about this prolific artist who enjoyed a long life.",
          "Every time we visit Nice (4 times a year) we go to Marc Chagal gallery, see the movies of Chagals life And see the paintings over and over again. The garden restaurant has lovely small portions of food. We simply love this plase.",
          "Attended a chamber music evening. Wonderful trio in an intimate hall at the Chagall Museum. Comfy seats, excellent acoustics. A mixed audience of all ages. Highly recommended.",
          "The spacious simplicity and intimacy of the architecture provide a great backdrop to re-evaluate this artist's work. The fascinating film (in French) helps view Chagall in his artistic and historic context. The works on show are based on his interpretation of old testament",
          "Great little museum with loads of charm Well worth a visit - not only to you get to see beautiful art - there is a small auditorium that shows a film of his life - very interesting.",
          "This one is dedicated to the works of Marc Chagall, it's situated a little off the beaten tracks so we used the hop on hop off bus to get us there and back. It's a nice enough museum but Chagalls not my favourite and disappointedly some of the main rooms were closed. I'd",
          "A highly religious artist. We weren\u2019t captivated by his simplistic painting style but then perhaps we\u2019re not artistically educated enough to fully appreciate his genius. The free audio guide made his work less impenetrable. A couple of rooms were closed so we got a price",
          "Although the museum is marked by time, the collection appears well put together. Upon entering the main building, the service was a bit rude ... at the 'vestiaire'",
          "I think they overprice this gallery compared to what it is. Even there was a room closed while being here and basically visited one room for 9eur per pers. Its not worth this experience. But it was a food walk to come here. The area is great",
          "Better than the Matisse museum. Nice cafe in gardens with WiFi. Well organised and well lit. An excellent gallery. .",
          "If you are a Chagall fan, this is the place to go. If you are a Chagall novice, the audio guides are invaluable (perhaps even if not a novice). The painting spaces: 1) one large room dedicated to his large format religious paintings, 2) a small alcove off this large room",
          "This museum was one of my highlights when visiting Nice and having know nothing about the artist. The art work is spectacular and the museum itself has been designed for the artist\u2019s work so flows very nicely. Well worth the 10 euro entry. Great giftshop too.",
          "Must see!!! Wonderful place. Art, life...wonderful experience...Strongly recommended!!! Musee National Marc Chagall..",
          "for those interested in contemporary art its in a beautiful building and has interesting contemporary exhibitions and permanent collections",
          "Easy to grab a bus from the center of town up to the Museum. It's a beautiful bright space. A lovely way to spend an afternoon and have a cup of coffee in the outdoor gardens.",
          "We enjoyed visiting this museum with our tour guide. The museum was built specifically for the art work that is hanging in it. I wish the long film about Chagall would have had English sub-titles.",
          "Great headsets to help understand the artwork. The stained glass is gorgeous! Not a big museum but significant works of Chagall.",
          "We walked to the Chagall Museum from old town and found it quite enjoyable, As I recall the admission was not that much and the audio guide in English is free with admission if you leave them some sort of identification. Really nice sized museum very easy to navigate, There is",
          "A very interesting 50 mins introduction film, but artwork is very disappointing. Mainly later monolithic pieces which are all more or less the same. Save your money and visit the Matisse museum which is much more varied and does a good job of covering the span of his life.",
          "I loved the visit, the colour and sequence of the paintings, the video, the mosaic and other parts of the buildings that help you plunge in the Chagall world. The colours are vivid, expressive, touching. I will keep a cherished memory of this visit.",
          "A 10-15 minute walk from Nice train station, when you arrive, there's not much impressive about the museum...which you later learn was Chagall's intention: to create a museum/gallery which was more of a house than a classic museum, hence its location in the Nice suburb of Cimiez",
          "Tons of Chagall in various media focused mainly on his religious works. A bit of trek to get there - but worth the walk up the hill (if you are able). Beware, the cafe was not open when were there. Also note, the museum closes for lunch at midday.",
          "I am not a dan of Chagall, but i grew to appreciate his work through this exhibit. and I was even left wanting to know more about Chagall's life as the exhibition commentary, while excellent, was focused on the themes within the art work.",
          "Quant Museum in Nice. Wonderful collection of paintings. Great way to spend the afternoon. Also a nice cafe in the outside garden.",
          "Nice not big museum with great inspiring collection of paintings and mosaic, have souvenir shop and cinema, where tou can watch an interesting movie about Marc Chagall art.",
          "We visited the museum last week and we were amazed and inspired by the colorful Chagall collection, esp. the biblical paintings like the \u2018Paradise\u2019 and \u2018Ark of Noah\u2019. The restaurant was closed for coffee in this season, and parking is not very easy in the narrow streets of",
          "Excellent exhibition of Chagall's works in oil, on paper and in stained glass. Not large but a comprehensive collection, well displayed. The notes were in French but the very informative film is shown several times daily in English and we enjoyed the insights it provided.",
          "This museum shares more intimate perspectives of Chagall. His travels, his loss, the persecution of the times, a flight to safety, the finding of a new home but constant dreams of his old one. This museum is not a bludgeon, it give you some easy close time with Chagall's",
          "The artists had an interesting mastery of colors. Dominated by his religion. Becomes less relevant with time. Expected the exhibit to have some impact - and none came. The Garderobe service does not make sense. You cannot leave your coat but you must leave your back pack.",
          "Chagall was a skilled artist in paint and glass who late in his life dedicated this museum to several large paintings of Old Testament events- Adam and Eve, Jacobs ladder, Noah. Each had some interesting passages but for me, they were not his best works- too much time spent on",
          "A very comprehensive display of the painter's works in a well lit and airy museum dedicated to his works only, mostly mystical as one would expect. Free ear-guides. A reasonably well furnished museum shop.",
          "The Marc Chagall museum in Nice helped me understand that Chagall was intensely interested in religion, and his Christian faith informs virtually all of his paintings in this collection. Perhaps because I do not share Chagall's religious passions, I was very underwhelmed. Don't",
          "This was more rewarding than the Matisse as Chagall painted a series of big pictures and some stained glass and a mosaic especially for the gallery. We are biased - we love Chagall.",
          "About 20 minutes to walk from central Nice but the final bit of the journey is tricky - the signs are confusing and you have to cross a big road through a tunnel. Done signs show two routes! It\u2019s rather hilly on the approach we took along a foot path and we were convinced we",
          "Simply amazing. This museum is located on the top of a quite and green hill of Nice, a beautiful sea city on the Southern French coast. The interiors are just brightful and completely matching with the concept of the museum and the paintings of Chagall. Plus, there is a hall",
          "The Museum and its works are something you must see. Excellent and in the context of how it all come to be.. worth it all!! The cafe was there in a lovely setting. Needs to be cleaned up as the day goes by. The toilets in the entrance are sadly lacking attention and",
          "This was a very nice museum and contained many of Marc Chagall original works. It was easy to get around and the plaques were in English so easy to understand the work. I would definitely recommend a visit. A lot of work were focused on his Christian beliefs. Climbing the",
          "The paintings here a very nice- explosions of color and fantasy. Problem is there are only two dozen of them- maybe a few more. I couldn't believe how small the place was. Most of the paintings seem to have been painted at the same time, the same size, in the same place.",
          "The exhibit featured Chagalls very religious work just not my favourite. Not very big. There is a gift shop and small outdoor cafe.",
          "We're not big fans, but our friends are, so we joined them to tour this very nice museum devoted to Chagall and his works. You definitely don't have to be an aficionado to enjoy the visit. You might even come away with an appreciation for his life and achievements. An",
          "If I weren't already a huge fan of Marc Chagall's work, this museum would compel me to become one. The first thing you notice as you enter is the color. Chagall was a master at drenching his paintings in joyful, exhilarating color. They make you smile. I love the biblical themes",
          "On a hot sunny day I went there and lots of watchable works of art. Nice temperature inside coming from a hot day. Nice little cafe outside",
          "We weren't sure what to expect, but from the moment we entered this beautiful modern musee/gallery set in its own small tranquil gardens we were transported into the life of this quite unique artist. The audio guides (free with your entrance fee, so do ask for one) are a must,",
          "My husband decided this museum over Matisee!! I was quite sceptical and i dont regret going there one bit. So many stained glass painting,large ones. Very inspirational painter,even at 80 he painted big ones. Not expensive at all,nice audio tour with clear explanations and makes",
          "We were really impressed by the quality of this museum. What we expected to be a tourist trap, turned out out to be the best collection of Chagall's works we've ever seen. The collection of late works (painted in 60s) was very surprising, most museums have only early Chagall on",
          "This was interesting enough to keep us occupied for an hour but when we visited the musee Matisse the difference was very clear. The Matisse museum was superior in every way! A beautiful place, fantastic collection and inspiring artwork. Bravo Matisse!",
          "We wanted to see this museum but some I the reviews made us wary. Turns out the museum is very interesting and easy to navigate. Get the audio guide. We walked here from the Matisse Museum. It\u2019s all down hill so it was easy.",
          "My daughter chose this and the Matisse museum as our morning activities in Nice and were not disappointed. The large paintings are very well displayed with audio information about each one. It is a treat to see so much of Chagall's art in one place!",
          "We've always enjoyed Chagall's works, but now have a better understanding of his perspectives and images. The audio tour is a must to understand his themes and imagery. There is a decent caf\u00e9 on the grounds if you need a snack or quick lunch.",
          "Visit this museum and use a hand held device to grasp the full understanding of Chagall's life, drives and creativity. Large works are displayed in bright open spaces with benches to rest and absorb the commentary.",
          "It was en average museum experience. They could and should consider to focus even further on tourists and non-speaking French audience in their services offerings",
          "There is a large collection on offer here and lots to see. I'd recommend around an hour to visit. The gallery is very pleasant and the price is very reasonable for enthusiasts. I'm not a huge fan of this artist but I visited with my family because they are fans of his work. My",
          "I never realized how much I might love Chagall by being immersed in his works in the space that he designed. This museum is a gem and will give you a whole new perspective on the artist.",
          "We were absolutely blown away with our visit to this gallery. Clearly our favourite visit during our 5 week trip. The gallery was purposeful set up by Marc & this sequence of display is fantastic. You need the audio guide to maximise the visit or preferably a guided tour. We",
          "This had to be largest display of Marc Chagall's art. An intro movie explained where he got his inspiration for creativity.",
          "I had the chance to visit the museum during a performance of the great musicians of the orchestra philharmonic of Nice and got a free access to see the amazing paintings of Chagall. Wonderful for ears and eyes!!!",
          "We had to been to this museum before. A new audio guide changed everything in the best way possible. The explanations were not too detailed but very insightful. And, of course, the arch speaks for itself.",
          "First we found it very confusing to walk there. The museum was small and there were some beautiful pieces but it was a bit underwhelming. One of the rooms was also blocked off for restoration so that was also disappointing.",
          "This museum is absolutly a necessity if you are interested i arts. And take a good time and listen to the descriptions of the symbolism of the works. The building in it self is very interesting.",
          "I am not an artsy person and my husband is certainly not! BUT we both enjoyed this compact museum! Huge canvases with meaningful images in a tiny well layer out building. Took us 1.5 hours to feel complete\ud83d\ude0a!",
          "The Musee National Marc Chagall in Nice is not to be missed. It is located in a quiet neighborhood north of the city, easily accessible by bus #15 from the town centre. There is no need to get there on a tour. The museum has a small gift shop, an auditorium with stunning stained",
          "This is a very mportant muzeum! Enjoyed each moment Recommend to take the audio guide. The entreance fee is 10 euro...",
          "As the Musee National Marc Chagall we were expecting a very special museum with a large display of his work. We found a modest number of interesting paintings which seem to have been pained specially for the museum. We have seen far better exhibitions of his work in other",
          "Pleasant grounds nice wee cafe for Snack Very interesting film about his life Not too long a walk from town",
          "Here you can see most of the Chagall's paints and learn about his flair/talent and where was inspired.",
          "Fantastic collection of Chaghalls painting donated by 5he artist. The talking devices wer3 great and better than most docents . The description of each painting was incredible. Parking is quite difficult and almost impossible",
          "Small museum, can be done in an hour and half. The audio tour gave me a good understanding of paintings which helped with my appreciation.",
          "There are a lot of nice little museum in the area, you can visit a few in a day because of their sizes. They also have nice gardens.",
          "Located in the hilly suburb of Cimiez on Nice\u2019s northern border, the Mus\u00e9e Marc Chagall houses one of the largest collections of works by the modernist Russian-French artist. Created during Chagall\u2019s lifetime, the museum was designed to showcase his Message Biblique series of 17",
          "We combined the trip with a visit to the Matisse Museum. The Chagall Museum is way better. Loved the artist large canvas paintings so full of color and life.",
          "Number 15 bus takes you there.10 Euro entry is well worth it. Beautifully displayed art work. Good if long and very interesting film 're his life. Only downside is outside cafe is cash only. A must",
          "We are Chagall fans and visiting here is a must for any lovers of 20th century painting. We have rarely met such disinterested and unhelpful staff. The caf\u00e9 in the grounds is good value.",
          "Very easy to visit both Chagall and Matisse museums in a Morning or Afternoon trip. Visit Matisse first than down the hill to Chagall. Both worth investigating. A new appreciation for abstract art.",
          "Wonderful art and gallery. Beautiful galleries show his different painting. The audio tours are free and well done. The scale of his painting make you see the beauty in his story telling in each painting. The movie is worth seeing and you can see four of his stain glassed window",
          "I never really understood his paintings till my visit. Situated in a large peaceful garden area (with a bar/restaurant) there is an auditorium where they run a short film (in English or French) detailing his life and his influences, and the actual museum. Made things much",
          "Chagall planned this museum during his life and therefore it gives a very personal perspective on his work. Easy to reach by bus and well worth the time.",
          "If you like Chagall you can see many of his works here. There is an extensive audio guide for free (need to leave an ID).",
          "The 10 euro entrance fee is reasonable. It is not a large museum, but the displays and explanations were quite informative. It was educational but not overwhelming. I feel like I learned helpful things about Chagall and the type of art he produced.",
          "This musee is \"The\" Musee about Chagall and built during he was alive: everything was thought by him and built for his works, paintings, ceramics and stained glasses. Highly recommended.",
          "Six rooms with original works from the artist, a wonderful movie in multiple languages telling his life story, and great notes near each of the paintings. Sadly, one of the rooms was closed, but the rest were nice to see and to learn about the artist. Expensive gift shop, and",
          "Although I'm aware of Marc Chagall I had a very hazy knowledge, something like \"Russian who moved to France, lots of blue, some religious content \", but that was all. Now, after a fascinating visit to this museum I have a much better understanding, although my previous sketchy",
          "It was a very big surprise for us..! It's a very small but beautiful museum. You can live the story of important Catholic moments through the paintings by Marc Chagall. The museum is itself like a big church for the atmosphere you feel.",
          "The Chagall Museum is small, elegant, and worth a quick visit. Of course, it doesn't rank with the other grand museums of Europe, or even America, but the collection is built around 17 paintings illustrating the biblical books of Genesis, Exodus and Song of Songs, which is",
          "Great presentation of Chagall's works. The building is perfect for displaying the works. Park like grounds around the building. There is also a small cafe for pre or post visit drinks and food.",
          "The Chagall Museum is wonderful. I always loved the colors in the paintings, but never really knew all the stories. Having a terrific guide certainly helped me understand the paintings. She was excellent!",
          "One of the highlights of our trip. Well laid out, easy to get there by bus and terrific movie on Chagall in addition. Free the first Sunday of the month.",
          "It was perfect for a slightly rainy and overcast day. The movie is a must see to understand the artist. Everything made so much sense after watching it. Light, open, and airy viewing. A bit of a walk from old town and up a little hill. No problem at all to walk and good",
          "The museum is located withink walking distance from the Old quarters. The temporary exhibition was dedicated to sculptures and (ceramic) murals. It was very interesting to see different sides to Chagall. + Free audioguide included in the entrance fee (10 EUR in total). Gives",
          "Time to get away from the beach and shopping. Take the bus to 'tis Musee and learn about the painting and history of Chagall. Be sure to take in the movie and make sure to get the audio guide or download the app. Well worth the time. Plus there is a lovely little cafe in the",
          "Situated in an outskirt of the busy city of Nice, amidst villa's with beautiful architecture and matching gardens, one finds this museum, dedicated to Marc Chagall. A nice modern building in a tranquil small park next to the building with a caf\u00e9. No temporary exhibition at the",
          "I wasn't a fan of Chagall before I visited this museum, but the selection of pictures, the audio guide and the roomy and calm exhibition space gave me time and perspective to change my mind. Chagall's paintings reward investigation - exhibited here in a beautiful space, there is",
          "This is a great little museum with some stunning works of Chagall! We were so pleased about our huge disappointment in the Musee Matisse. It also has a nice little tearoom / restaurant in the garden",
          "Having seen the play Flying Lovers of Vitebsk it was nice to see his works up close. The film screening at the end could have benefited from subtitles but my French was enough to get the general drift. Powerful and sad, flickers of a world wiped out. Consider getting a Riviera",
          "Beautiful lovingly assembled exhibit of the best bible-themed work of the great master. The work was assembled and installed by the artist himself which gives it another dimension in understanding the work and allows to be submerged into Chagell's world of art and love. The room",
          "Just loved this museum! It was surrounded by beautiful garden and Caf\u00e9. Museum was not too big. It was modern and easy to walk around. Must visit place in Nice!",
          "Its a warm walk from town, but so worth it! Amazing Chagall paintings and glass windows. A bit heavy on the biblical theme, but still, its Chagall! Whats not to love!",
          "I am not a fan of Chagall but my wife is. Nonetheless I found the musee interesting and particularly enjoyed the film about Chagall's life being shown in the comfortable theatre. We walked to the musee form Acropolis and also discovered the delightful Jardin of the Villa",
          "Only his biblical paintings are on display at the moment but the course, light, texture and detail of those is amazing and worth the visit. The film in the Auditorium is very I formative Catch the #15 bus to this and also the Matisse Museum .",
          "great architecture specially made for Chagall, exhibits only interesting for people with outspoken Bible knowledge",
          "Been here three times in 35 years. A must see. The paintings are different from what you may have seen as each painting seems to have one predominant color. Take No. 15 bus, blue line to get there- very quick. We took taxi to get there but no taxis to get back to town.",
          "We find that most museums and art galleries (understandably) display a range of artifacts and artwork by a range of artists - which can be overwhelming. By contrast the Chagall museum has a focus which is a joy in its simplicity. On the day we visited we paid a discounted entry",
          "I have not been a big fan of Chagall but the museum made me understand his art much better. Good audio presentation, interesting film (in both French and English), impressive and big collection of pictures, sculptures, etc Recommended!",
          "This museum is unique because Marc chagall actually helped in the design and other really shows off his works really well a must see if visiting nice",
          "Caught the bus from the centre up to the Gallery (1.50 Euro). A pleasant break from the bustle of the city. The gallery is set out in a modern airy building. If you don't know Chagall's work, it's interesting to learn about his background and the symbolism in his work.",
          "As a great fan of Marc Chagall i was so happy to visit the museum devoted to his art. There are a plenty of interesting facts and materials. Audio guide information was totally new for me, so i recommend to take it.",
          "It is a real privilege to stand in the Musee Marc Chagall and understand that this is the gallery that the great artist himself oversaw while he was still alive. The depth of his works is truly amazing.",
          "Too be honest i didnt know who Marc Chagall was before i enter the museum on the last day for me in Nice I had to find out a little more about this man. Was he clothes designer or a man behind some art and the hour I used inside here was worth the 10 euro entrance. Not so long",
          "well worth the short trip out of the centre. great collection, pleasant garden, free parking, thoroughly worthwhile",
          "Incredible!! Better than Matisse museum and I LOVE Matisse so if you must choose between the two I would choose Chagall. Be sure to get the audio guide. I learned so much about the artist and his biblical works but best of all is the incredible vibrant art!! And you are free to",
          "The museum is very easy easy to access with the bus system ..entrance fee not overpriced . The displays of Chagall 's art works are amazing .",
          "Whether or not you are a Marc Chagall fan, this little museum is a must see in Nice. The paintings, sculpture and stained glass are memorable and beautifully shown in this jewel of a place.",
          "what a beautiful place The garden outside is tranquil and prepares you for the museum inside. The paintings of Chagall are impressive and thought provoking. The sculptures worth a look If planning to walk probably go early morning as the trek up the hill is tough in the",
          "Marc Chagall is one of the nicest museum I have been before. Very straight, clear, accurate and accented on Marc Chagall's cultural legacy. Buateful, cute and cosy museum building still keep Marc Chagall's spirit in the air. You can spend here easily a half of the day avoiding",
          "With great anticipation I hoofed the fairly long uphill walk from the commercial center to the museum through some nice neighborhoods. I opened my purse, handed over my ten euros and answered where I was from. Signs told me to keep my ticket to get the free audio guide. I did",
          "I dunno i am sure this is ped estrian but I didn't see a single thing I would have in my house or yard if my great aunt gave it to me for free. If you LOVE Chagall definitely go. But for me it was very amatureish .. dripping paint all at the painting bottoms... multiple",
          "I saw the Chagal show in Montreal so I thought I'd skip the gallery. I'm so happy I didn't, these are paintings that don't go on loan and the museum was designed to showcase them. Being Jewish and of Russian descent, Chagall holds a special place in my heart. But my partner also",
          "Enjoyed visit to this museum. A few things to note though. There is a film (very good apparently) that is shown at 10.15, 12.15, 14.15 in French and 11.15. 13.15 and 15.15 in English. When purchasing admission tickets there is no information provided about this film. We missed",
          "Surprised by the variety of experiences of Chagall's work in this relatively small museum, we were both happy that we took the time to visit. You get an electronic \"guide\" so you can listen to explanations of each piece, even though I personally rather enjoyed taking my own",
          "I knew very little about Chagall before my visit and was blown away by his paintings. I loved them The sculptures were less interesting for me. The museum has a caf\u00e9, a shop and a garden, and inside, they have air conditioning in the summer.",
          "I couldn't wait to get to the museum and I want to see it again, because I am a great admirer of Marc Chagall's work and personality. Some reviews said it was disappointing, but if you don't like something it may certainly be the case. Perhaps if you are not sure, read up",
          "We read great reviews about this place so thought we'd give it a try but was very disappointing and too expensive for what it is. Very small and can be done in 15-30 mins. If you don't really like Chagall then this place definitely not for you.",
          "I love Chagall so I knew I'd love this museum. It's situated up on Cimiez hill with stunning views of the city and the bay below. Although it focuses on particular religious themes there are plenty of beautiful at works thoughtfully displayed to admire if you're a fan.",
          "This beautiful museum is not your typical boring museum. The art work is well displayed in creative, engaging locations. Chagall's renditions of biblical stories are colorful and unique. If in Nice, don't miss this museum.",
          "A short walk from our delightful Petit Palais hotel the first thing we did was to visit this Museum. Easy to find, my memory still holds the in depth artwork, especially the color blue. Large walls were perfect for displaying the large pieces. Easy to navigate in open spaces",
          "Very impressive situated beautiful part Nice with its own gardens and cafe houses wonderful collection Chagall bequeathed by him to French nation and displayed according to his own instructions",
          "This museum of Chagall's work was amazing. Many of his important works are here. Definitely recommended to get the headset as the explanations are very helpful.",
          "We loved the Musee National Marc Chagall. The layout of the museum allows an easy flow from room to room, and the audio + written explanations make learning about the artist so accessible. We've seen Chagall windows in the past, but seeing the paintings really was quite special.",
          "A truly stunning museum - incredible Chagall paintings on display. An amazing experience, strongly recommend",
          "Visiting in this museum is relaxing afternoon in the busy city at least in May then there is no too much tourists.",
          "Although this does not cover all of Chagall's work, it is incredible to think that this museum was set up as a National Memorial while Chagall was alive. It mainly has works based around biblical stories and you see elements of his life in these as well. The curating of these",
          "Took the tram line #1 and then a short walk to the Chagal museum (followed by a bus to Matisse further up the road). Splendid exhibits within a busy but quite modern building and small grounds. Well worth a visit. Impossible to add helpfully to the many words written about",
          "This was a highlight of my time in Nice. As a Chaim Potok fan who places his protagonist squarely in Nice and alongside Chagall himself, this small museum was breath-taking. Large paintings really do justice to this amazing artist. It's laid out well and the audio guide is a",
          "We spent an enjoyable hour looking around at Chagall's work. Too bad that as a federal museum it isn't included in the municipal pass!",
          "For anyone with an interest in Chagall's work this is a must visit. The collection is impressive. The museum showcases a set of paintings on Old Testament themes along with a changing and varied collection of other Chagall works. (Sculpture when we were there.) The venue is",
          "Very nice museum with large Chagall paintings on display. Also a very worthwhile film of his life in the theater - a good place to relax and learn.",
          "We are a couple of jaded are loving New Yorkers who live in a city with major museums where international exhibits visit frequently. There were many museums which were homes of major artists in the south of France we did not visit because exhibitions from these museums had come",
          "This is a very nice way to spend a morning. Even though I was not to sure what to expect the audio guide is very good and explains what is going on in each painting.",

          "Very nice museum with the biblic scenes of Chagall and a few stuff around. A little bit expensive for more or less 20 paintings in total.",
          "This is a museum entirely dedicated to Chagall's work, built for him during his lifetime. The permanent exhibition is a brilliant compilation of his experiences as a Jew during WW II. He depicted many biblical themes on huge paintings ranging from the Exodus from Egypt, Moses",
          "A lovely museum dedicated to Marc Chagall. Free electronic guides offer insightful descriptions of the works on display, delving into the personal life of Chagall. Well laid-out and logically divided into sections, we very much enjoyed our visit, and learned a lot about Chagall,",
          "To appreciate Marc Chagall fully, you must know his history. The film in an auditorium blessed with Chagall glass gives a great background and includes an interview with the artist(runs in English and French). It helps one to recognize the emotion, history, and depth of his",
          "We are Chagall fans so this was one of our 'to do' items in Nice. The exhibit is very small and we were rather disappointing, expecting to see more of his stained glass and other works.",
          "Nice building, good presentation of the paintings with text and audio guide (which is highly recommended). Audio guide is especially good for the kids.",
          "It's a short journey out of Nice's busy tourist district and definitely worth it. It was great to get up close to such pieces of Chagall's work. Loved it!!",
          "I was fairly unfamiliar with Chagall's paintings but in this museum they all have a biblical context which make it kind of interesting but his style isn't my favourite. The paintings are huge and there is a big selection. Also a little cafe in site. I bought a French Riviera two",
          "This is not surprisingly a museum only with art from Marc Chagall. I think all paintings are inspired by the Bible. Takes roughly an hour to see it all, and it was a nice hour :-).",
          "If you are an admirer of Marc Chagall's works you will not be disappointed with a visit to this museum. Plan on a two to three hour time allotment for your visit.",
          "The museum has a marvelous collection of Chagalls paintings. You will get a very good impression of his work by visiting this museum. Do not miss the opportunity!",
          "Hadn't been a fan until I saw it in person. Liking it more and more now that I gave it a chance, especially the Bible scenes.",
          "The museum is curated and designed by Chagall's input which makes the visit more special. The whole collection of biblical works of Chagall is in the museum. In these works, he represents the stories from the old testament using modern art techniques. The audioguide goes through",
          "Excellent choice . The place is very beautifil , the collection amazing and veryh close to the old town .",
          "I wanted to see this museum because I had seen the BBC programme about a (fake) chagall. Looking at the originals in the museum it was clear why they determined it to be fake. Well worth a look",
          "It was awsome to see these unique and beautiful paintings displayed as the artist wanted them to be. The guide was very informative and the explanations were very helpful in pointing out aspects in each painting that we might have missed. It was an uplifting experience for me.",
          "We came in to VilleFranche-Sur-Mer on a cruise ship and in a pouring rain, took the train and a cab to this museum. It was well worth the time. If you've never seen a Chagall in person (whether a painting or his stained glass), then do so here. The biblical scenes I've seen in",
          "Small museum but great sample of Chagall's masterwork focused on the Bible. Really enjoyed the experience and recommend the rich audioguide and even the one for children, really fun!",
          "This exhibit is a well presented collection of this interesting art. There is also a nicely written film which outlines the life of Mark Chagall that is worthwhile taking time to watch. I found myself looking at the world through a changed perspective.",
          "The museum exceeded my expectations. There was a nice sampling of his work, which emphasized Old Testament stories with lots of splashes of color. The museum was very easy to get to and we went in conjunction with viewing Matisse's home, also very interesting. Would recommend",
          "This \"National Museum\" and the adjoining park are nothing short of remarkable. The original works of art by Chagall were inspired by the Bible--- and the hanging of the works were arranged by the artist!! Over time the collection has expanded, and is now the largest collection",
          "The museum was dedicated on Chagall's 86th birthday and built to house his Biblical (old testament) series, and a second series of paintings on the Song of Solomon. In addition, there are some of his statuary and stained glass windows. The art explanations are in English as",
          "For art lovers in Nice, this is a must-see! It is a small museum, but the works are spectacular and the stained glass is breathtaking. I recommend the film as well.",
          "Well worth a visit when in Nice. The audio guide really added detail and the paintings are special. It is close to the Matisse museum but is definitely the better of the two if you have a short time",
          "The Museo Chagall is an exceptional place to visit. The grounds are lovely and the outdoor cafe is so very pleasant. Of course the most compelling aspect was the presentation of the art. The museum exhibited about 30 very large and striking works by the artist. The",
          "Although we were expecting this to be a bigger exhibition, particularly in view of the size of the buildings/gardens, it did not disappoint in quality. We were fortunate to be here for annual \"free museum night\" and so went in for niothing! This presents a range of Chagall's",
          "Irritatingly, only two rooms of paintings. Not much more. Special exhibits closed. It seems like the museum is just there to advertise for the cafe. Also: parking is very difficult to find, unless you pay (which is expensive). Disappointing.",
          "The museum was worth it as I was interested in seeing Chagall's biblical paintings. If you are not interested in seeing these, then don't visit the museum as it's all they have. Museum is small, can see everything in less than 1 hour.",
          "This museum is well worth a no 15 bus ride up the hill from the old town. Loved it .. So much I went back for a second visit within the week. Truly fantastic setting for these wonderful huge canvasses. Don't miss the auditorium .. Great windows.",
          "For those who love, or even like modern art, definitely worthwhile. Increased my appreciation of this great painter. Must see the movie!",
          "Difficult to find on foot and best bit was the cafe which served decent snack from a very small kitchen. Paintings not great by my taste and does not take long to get round. Not free as guide book said but 10 Euro an adult. Not great value",
          "If visiting make sure to take the audio device as it explains the paintings and what the painter. These are free as well which is unusual. Nice little outdoor cafe serving some food. Video in asuditorium a must to get to know Chagall's life. Small museum overall so well worth",
          "This is one of the best individual artist museums in all of France! Yes, that's quite a statement, but I've seen many of them, and this is definitely one of my favorites. Many of the wonderfully colorful, expressive, and symbolic works of Marc Chagall are well presented, well",
          "Small museum set in beautiful garden with a caf\u00e9. A tour bus and school visit on the morning we visited but the queue moved quickly. The exhibition of Biblical Message work was stunning - well worth a visit.",
          "When we visited it was very busy with tourist's and schoolchildren. Mr Chagall produced incredible paintings are something amazing.",
          "If you are a big fan of Chagall this is definetly a museum you can't afford to miss. It is not huge but the paintings selection is impressive. A little out of the way but it is worth your time. And if you are not really into Chagall, after your visit, you might change your mind.",
          "The grounds and building showcase this series of Biblical paintings by Marc Chagall. The audio commentary enhances one's visit and is included with the cost of admission. Well worth a visit.",
          "We visited this gallery when recently in Nice. The exhibition showing his depictions of the old testament are wonderful and really worth a visit. The headphone commentary (French and English versions) help to explain his work well. The cafe/ restaurant was very good too and good",
          "A lovely museum devoted to a amazing artist, all the staff are welcoming and friendly. Just be careful of the amount of bus trips which go there, I suggest that you get there early!! Also the cafe on site is very valve and do great crepes. Also this is a museum based on Chagall",
          "Easy to reach on bus 15. Very poor management. I arrived after 11 am and although the queue consisted of only 18 people, it took half an hour to get a ticket, as there was only one person issuing them. Only two ladies' toilets, including a disabled one and the bathroom was",
          "I saw Marc Chagall paintings before, the museum collection, however impressed me beyond my imagination. Highly recommended to everyone who visits",
          "For any lover of colors, history and knowledge of the bible, the Chagall museum in Nice is a must. The museum which was designed and inaugurated by the artist itself has only a handful of the artist's works yet each one is a master-piece. Would advise to take a hand-set (which",
          "Not being much of an art buff but appreciative of art, I was pleasantly surprised by his work. Some interesting history around him, his paintings and the museum. There were a set of paintings depicting the highlights of the Bible. I'm pretty much an atheist, so the story",
          "no other way to describe it. A most to any visit to Nice. Bring your camera. You will be able to take excellent pictures.",
          "So to be fair the museum display of Marc Chagall work is excellent. However, it was really hard to fully appreciate it as the crowds of people that streamed in from the bus and school tours seem to have minimal respect for those who wanted to appreciate the art. Since cell",
          "Beautiful building to house these wonderful paintings by Marc Chagall. Well worth a visit. We walked here from the center of town in about a half hour.",
          "The museum is actually quite small, so when there is a temporary exhibition, there are just a few rooms showing Chagall's work. The displayed art is beautiful; however you can check everything in 30 minutes (unless you want to watch the movie shown in the auditorium). So, the",
          "Maybe I was expecting too much... There was a very small collection of paintings, religious themes from the Bible and Song of Songs. But the most interesting thing was a film about Chagall's life. It was interesting to watch although it was in French and I understood only few",
          "Then is a wonderful museum with attractive architecture and a pleasant caf\u00e9. The collection is stunning and well explained with free commentary earpieces. There is also a film on the artist which is well worth seeing. A highlight of the local museums. Well worth the \u20ac10 entry",
          "The collection is small but interesting. It's quite an uphill walk at the end to get there but there are good facilities when you get there. Small collection is focused on religious works",
          "This is definitely a must see on your next visit to Nice. Probably the finest collection of Chagall art and certainly the place to learn all you wish to know about this great artist!",
          "The pictures are as we know amazing and typical Chagall. But it was kind of part of the museum was empty, just shadows of olive trees... but then you got to the cinema and that film made the difference... really worth watching. It is in French, so ask if translation is possible,",
          "An interesting insight into Marc Chagall's art the entrance is not free so our tour guide stayed at the entrance which meant, we could have got an Uber there. Actually used Uber around the city as taxis rip tourists off. On the way there it cost me \u20ac45 while when using Uber just",
          "I am not really a modern art person but I have seen some interesting modern expositions and I've found them nice or interesting. This one is kind of empty and Mr. Chagall's work ist just not my thing. This Museum ist really for Mr Chagall's or modern art lovers (imho).",
          "Visiting Nice you should include the Chagall museum. The colorful paintings will surely make an impression on anyone who visits. Recommend.",
          "I was not sure what to expect but found this to be a \"must visit\" if in Nice. The system to hear in ones own language about each piece was a bonus and the paintings are both stimulating and interesting",
          "Lovely collection housed in light filled building. Not far from nce centre. Please check web site as trip advisor opening hours are incorrect. Worth while visiting. Nice gardens small cafe although it didnt look nice so i gave it a miss.",
          "A profound exhibit of classical Chagall pieces of historical and biblical events. Large colorful canvasses in beautiful surroundings. Definitely take the free audio player to get into more depth background to the paintings.",
          "for a rainy day... You get a perfect impression of Chagall's \u0153uvre, of his love for his wife, his belief in religion.... Often the museum also shows temporal exhibitions that are also interesting.",
          "Wow! I was amazed not only because of the paintings but the brilliant guide. It fully explained the story behind the pictures and drew attention for tiny details and their significance. Probably the best I've ever experienced.",
          "This museum is small but has an excellent display of Chagall's work. The colours dazzle and the style of the paintings draw you to take a closer look while at the same time the overall impressing is one of joy. Having said that many of the topics of the paintings are sombre",
          "Having walked the 2 kilometre up the hill to visit the Matisse museum and the Franciscan monastery - both worth a visit - we were hungry and thirsty. But they have no associated cafes for weary travellers and are situated in a mainly residential area with no restaurants either.",
          "Small, smart and extremly nice museum. Take 1-1,5 h to enjoy it. Will be closed 16.45 (no entrance after that)."

          "Verdict: 5/5 Recommended Time: 120 mins Fees: 0 Info: This is the largest shopping mall in the small city of Monte Carlo. The mall has been luxuriously designed with full marble interior, huge chandelier, and major brands. My experience: I visited the mall not for shopping",
          "This is a very cool mall to wonder through and window shop. Everything from the marble floors, to the crystal chandeliers, to the wrought iron railings screams Monaco. Very fun people watching too.",
          "We were visiting Monaco as part of a cruise tour and had very limited free time to eat so we thought we'd grab something quick to eat from the shopping centre...Big mistake! An awful stale ham baguette was \u20ac9! I expected it to be expensive but the quality was rubbish. Just did",
          "We found this shopping centre because I wanted to go to Laduree. I was disappointed in the range on offer at Laduree (and what's more my macaroons were simply placed in a paper bag to carry, suffice to say they were all squashed by the time we got back to our hotel in Eze!), but",

          "I'm so glad to have tracked down at last the Metropole shopping centre! It was worth the search for the entertainment factor although not a place for serious shopping unless you have the income to match!",
          "There are a variety of reasonably priced restaurants, with pleasant service. The shops, no surprise, are geared towards the wealthy but it is a good place to spend an hour or so to do some window shopping",
          "Beautiful interior, but was not at all impressed by the selection of stores. Needless to say it was quite pricey, but if you're in Monte Carlo, it won't take much of your time so go ahead and take a look.",
          "Happened to chance upon this lovely luxurious mall whilst walking around Monaco. Mostly luxury branded shops, and some very nice Cafe serving great tasting coffee. It is also a place where you can do people watching where you'll notice all the women (and men) walking around with",
          "If you have been up to the casino square you may as well visit the shopping centre, even if its just for a coffee and sandwich. It is decarated like a stalely home and far beond an westfield or intu back home. Some shops are expensive as you would expect in Monaco but you do",
          "Opposite the lovely wee park by Casino Square are some escalators- take a ride down into this subterranean shopping centre- full of chandeliers and oppulant surroundings but worth a visit even if to sit and enjoy a reasonably priced - 3 euro - cappuccino and people watch. Plenty",

          "Very beautiful and all very expensive not blue water in UK but it's worth a visit to see how the other half live . We had lunch and coffees very nice",
          "This is worth seeing to understand what rich people buy and how much they pay for it. If you want a designer tuxedo for your 6 year old this is the place to get one.",
          "The shopping center is beautiful, but all that beauty comes along with the prices within the stores themselves. It's definitely on the very high end of shopping, so there aren't too many stores available for you unless you're looking to drop hundreds or possibly a few thousand",
          "This place really was designed with exquisite taste. Underground car park is immaculately designed and kept, Cafes and boutiques all high end and the walk along the malls are pleasant. Step into the main road below or the escalator on the top floor will take you to a pathway",
          "High end shops and boutiques - lovely cafe - at this time of year we especially appreciated the time away from the heat and humidity",
          "This small but charming shopping center has it all for everyone. From luxurious gifts, brands and food products to lunch or delicate pastries, you will find whatever you need just steps away from the heart of beautiful Monte-Carlo Casino and Hotel de Paris. If you are looking",
          "Again something for everyone. When my son and I went to the Casino, my wife and daughter went here. I only knew about it because of tripadvisor. It is across the street from the gardens of the casino but if you did not know it was there it could be difficult to find. Anyways,",
          "Have used the bar extensively over the years, but never actually stayed in the hotel, justifies its elevated status. Rooms excellent, and beds superbly comfortable ..... Didn't have a meal, this time round...only gripe is pool terrace a bit noisy....",
          "This is a lovely little indoor shopping centre on three floors there are great private shops as well as some fantastic deli's to get some good treats.",
          "Certainly worth a visit to this superior shopping mall! As we were staying literally next to it, we went there every day, so we would highly recommend it for shopping and eating there when in Monaco.",

          "Unique items for sale that we haven't found elsewhere in our travels. Great little Parisian gourmet shops where we picked up local chocolat and macarons. Delicious food, wonderful service, and classy shops. We really enjoyed wandering around, shopping, and eating in this",
          "Went here during Xmas and its definitely an OMG moment, massive chandelier and all the designer brands in place and make sure you've got deep pockets as it's pricey but who cares!!!!",
          "Wow! This is what I call a shopping centre. It is decorated absolutely beautifully very lavish! A lot of the shops are quite expensive but you can find a few gems with bargains- especially make up. Lovely coffee bars too. Some tourists will be followed round closely which makes",
          "Trendy and very upmarket shopping Mall close to the Casino. It is very beautiful, spread over several floors with stunning decor. If you have a lot of cash to spare, this is the place to shop as very expensive! There is a beautiful chandelier hanging over the spiral stake",
          "This small but modern and upscale mall is underneath the Hotel Le Metropole. It has a number of interesting shops, including an antique shop with some real treasures. There is also a selection of places for coffee and snacks. Overall a nice experience,",
          "Under ground (floor 0) was luxurious feel like mall. At the bottom was nice caf\u00e9 named as Metcaf\u00e9. There were even gluten-free pasta salad. It was nice surprise, little dry, but tasted okay. To next the caf\u00e9 were also shop full of cosmetics. Good brands and very, very nice",
          "This is a very modest Mall atleast comparing to what I see all the time in Dubai, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. Reasonably small and nothing too great about it. Chandelairs were certainly the only nice thing and the flooring is beautiful.",
          "Walking around in this shopping centre was really an experience - the finish is high quality with chandeliers hanging from the roofs! Obviously items sold here fall at the top of the price range...",
          "A small shopping mall with high end stores and caf\u00e9s near the casino. The mall has a series of indoor and outdoor escalators. Most of the fun for the kids was riding them in and out. The shops were less interesting.",
          "The bulding tells a lot about the royalty and tha majest of the area. Thus you can find items in all budgets",
          "Been here many times you will find some good deli's furnishing stores and fashion stores, a lot of people might miss it as tucked away discreetly next to the metropole hotel.",
          "Broad selection. Even has a Spar!!!!!!! Brilliant sandwiches - good value. Excellent shopping. A hidden gem.",
          "So we asked to be taken to the shops, and we were informed that this was the 'normal' I.e. High street shop mall. However we were surprised to see that the shops were pretty much all high end shops (Gucci, Kenzo, Maxmara etc). It's a nice way to spend a day, but if you are into",
          "Amazing shops, wonderful cafes , a great experience Lovely little Boulangerie near Spar to get early morning croissants. Well priced, friendly staff throughout, and wonderful shops to get items you can only get in MC",
          "My wife liked this mall and the shops here, the credit card was dented in a serious way but as most of the items purchased were for me I was happy",
          "Doesn't really match the status of Monaco being the rich and famous city. It sells some second hand designers' bags,It has Long CHamps shop inside.",
          "We visited with our teenage children and spent way too much money. Gorgeous stores and people. new definition \"Trophy Wife\" they were amazing!! Head to toe designer and gorgeous with their little dogs in tow. We ate at the Sphere caf\u00e9 which served Italian food, cooked by there",
          "Multi level shopping centre in the heart of Monte Carlo, prices and designers on par with other European centres. Some unique stores. Huge chandeliers and nice marble tiles. Prices at Hugo or Granr the same. Free WIFI. Pets allowed but no smokers. Spend some time",
          "This is a very good located and nice little mall, just near the casino and with a cool and elegant inside decoration. There are other interesting shopping areas around but this is one of the best.",
          "Elegant, and pricey. Of course. Thankfully all I bought were batteries for my electric shaver. I'd suggest you do something similar, though it is great to window shop here.",
          "There were a few interesting shops, but I had much better luck with stores on the streets of Monaco.",
          "All I can say is \"Wow\"!! Before I saw this I thought all shopping centres were much the same, but not this one!! Top end designer stores, fantastic d\u00e9cor, spotlessly clean and even if you cannot afford to spend, there is no charge to look!! We visited on a fairly grey mizzly",
          "I was intrigued that there were hardly any reviews and zero photos of this place on Trip Advisor, so when in Monte Carlo, I had to check it all. I was expecting four or five high end shops in a small corridoor calling itself a shopping centre but no, this is a major attraction",
          "we went in on a sunday but all the shops was closed which is not like at home. so we just window shopped it is very posh and clean inside think if they was open i still would not have enough money to spend in there ...",
          "Lots of expensive stores for window shopping, but there are also several cafes with sandwiches, panini, coffee, etc. that are a great place to stop for an affordable lunch.",
          "OK, it's nice and beautiful inside, helpful staff of course, pretty boutiques BUT it is tiny. It is not a place where you could go mad on shopping but then again no one goes there for shopping shopping I guess. Overall it is worth visiting.",
          "Lovely decorated shopping centre, good for window shopping and sheltering from the rain if you are unlucky enough to visit Monaco in bad weather. Affordable coffee/sandwich shops and a great chocolate shop for gifts.",
          "Very chic shopping mall with a number of shops that will empty your pockets. You can also enjoy your coffee here in AC environment. Travel bags, clothing, children clothing, jewelry, small drugstore are at your disposal, my personal favorite is FNAC with lot of electronics, DVDs",
          "very expensive clthes and jewellry shops that were out of our price range but was great to look at. The centre has unusual sculptures and lots of chandeliers. Good for not so expensive coffee shops and in basement has a Spar supermarket with a pastries and sandwich deli if you",
          "If you love shopping and do not wanted, or do not need to know the price of things this is for you, as the saying goes if you have to ask you can't afford it.",
          "This is a really great shopping mall underneath the city. I've been to Monte Carlo several times before and never hit this shopping mall as we're always so busy. Our apartment is even just on the same block overlooking the Casino Gardens. This trip we decided to walk around"

        "wiki": "The Fairmont Monte Carlo is a luxury resort located in Monte Carlo managed by the Canadian-based hotel chain Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction of the hotel was completed in the early 1970s. The hotel was built on the spot of the first Monegasque railway station, by the real estate development company Caroli Group. As it stands today, there is still a section of the original station wall hidden in one of the hotel's offices. Instead of building the hotel up the rocks, the property is partially built into the Mediterranean coast. The hotel started under the name of Loews Hotel Monte-Carlo and opened in August 1975. In 1998, Toufic Aboukhater bought the hotel from Loews Hotels Holding Corporation for an undisclosed price and renamed it the Monte Carlo Grand Hotel.In 2004 the hotel was acquired by hotel chain Fairmont Hotels and Resorts for 215 million euro. It was the first purchase by a joint venture of Fairmont, Kingdom Hotels International and Bank of Scotland Corporate. After acquiring the hotel, the complex was renamed Fairmont Monte Carlo. A renovation project began in 2005 and in 2009 the hotel  began its second round of renovations.\nDuring the annual Formula 1 racing event on Circuit de Monaco, the racers make use of the tunnel under the hotel which is considered one of the most dangerous parts of the circuit. One of the corners is still named after the previous hotel name, the Grand Hotel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonaco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Hotel Fairmont Monte Carlo, Monaco at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

          "At only \u20ac3.80 (A student ticket), the Jardin Exotique is a superb attraction. From high up among the cacti and succulents this garden provides the best views over the country! Worth the entrance fee for these views alone. As you wonder up and down the winding party\u2019s of the",
          "We spent a fantastic few hours here for my birthday outting whilst holidaying in France. It is such an interesting place and definitely worth visiting. Make sure you do the cave tour, its really worth it!",
          "This was really wonderful. I have never seen such a collection of mature cacti like this before. Many were flowering which is a treat in itself. The gardens are on the hillside and the walkways cleverly engineered to allow easy meandering.",
          "These gardens are at the far upper left of Monaco and reached by the number 6 bus. I had never dreamed that there were so many different varieties of cactus. How the gardens were put together defies belief as the cactusses grow out of the most unusual places and are very",
          "There are more cacti per square metre than I have seen in several visits to Arizona. The ability to walk up and down steps is vital here as the site is situated on the cliff face. Fabulous construction and beautiful flora",
          "This is a fantastic cactus garden with specimens larger than I thought possible with lots of nooks and crannies to soak in the views. Senior rate of 5 euros was appreciated. Free cave tour (believe every hour) which was really worth the time (about 40 mins). Never seen a cave",
          "A 24 travel pass for E5.50 is worth it in hilly Monaco. The no. 2 bus goes to all the main tourist sites including these gardens. The paths are all on the cliff side and although are very much up and down could be used by pushchairs and possibly wheelchairs. Even in February",
          "A must when in Monaco. Easy to reach by bus at the 'top of the country'. The views are spectacular and the exotic plants are beautiful. We did the tour of the caves as well, which is included in the entry price and fascinating. Easy to spend a couple of hours here.",
          "A great variety of trees and plants. All colours can be seen here. Very neat and clean. Great for relaxing evenings or summer hot days!",
          "The garden is ho-hum. There's a few art installations and nice shade to escape a hot day but nothing spectacular. It pales into comparison to the ocean horizon view surrounding it.",
          "Great expositions, great views, plants, cave and museum. We had a really nice time. I think it was worth it.",
          "Wish we had left more time to spend here. Interesting not just for the cliffside walk but overall. We only popped in as we had a little time to kill post visiting the palace and the side street shops. We SHOULD have skipped the shops and spent time here it's lovely with many",
          "My wife is a horticulturist specialising in succulents, so she was keen to visit the gardens.. We went to Monaco on the train from Nice for a day trip. It was pouring when we arrived and we almost turned back to the station. However, we walked up the hill towards the Gardens",
          "This garden is absolutely stunning and my all time favourite places on Earth, beautiful views of Monte Carlo and most impressive and exotic cactuses I\u2019v ever seen in my life, walking though this garden feels heavenly and yet tranquil, it\u2019s very picturesque and if you\u2019re in",
          "We had a most pleasant stroll through these garden admiring the plants and various statues dotted around the Gardens.",
          "if you like cactuses this is the place to be (at Monaco); hundreds of beautiful and many years old cactuses, very impressive and awesome, little hard to get there (up the hill) but there are some elevators which help; within the site you can buy refreshments only from vending",
          "Delightful gardens with interesting sculptures scattered within. As well as the gardens the view over the ocean is superb. Worth a visit",
          "This was the first place we visited in Monaco. It is very high up but worth it. There is a free bus that can take you up the hill (unsure if it\u2019s always free or it was free because it was a Sunday). Entrance was free too - again I think it\u2019s free on a Sunday and we didn\u2019t go",
          "The Jardin Exotique is high up in Monaco, so will take a walk or a bus to arrive, but it is worth it! The entrance fee is approximately \u20ac8. There is so much to see in the gardens & the view of Monaco from above are amazing. On the hour, there is a guided tour of the underground",
          "This garden and its beautiful cacti provide a break from the bustle of the city. Walk around the garden, and stop for a tour of the grotto or at the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology",
          "Keep in mind that the US based cellular providers don't work well or not at all in Monaco, so be prepared to park anywhere near the water and do a nice 30 min climb to the Gardens. It's worth it because on the way you will get many photo opportunities to capture this unusually",
          "As is everything here in Monaco - the gardens and surrounds are fabulous. Saving up now to live here!!",
          "We took the #2 bus here from the Casino area, near the Tourism office. Superb view of Monaco. Must visit. The gardens itself are pretty excellent too. Similar to what you see in Eze Village. The views itself are worth on its own.",
          "Very picturesque tropical gardens, mostly cacti, with windy paths down the steep hillside. You wonder how they built the place back then. Great views of Monaco, and at the bottom there's a grotto cave which is interesting and a welcome cool break on a hot afternoon (it was 33C",
          "We went there in June, while it was not yet hot this year, but it's recommended to bring a hat for the sun anyway. We had a very enjoyable stroll over the various levels. The scenery was particularly breathtaking at the top. We could have easily stayed most of the day, but for",
          "A very nice collection of cactus plants with other exotics spread around and amazing views on Fontvieille and the Rocher/Main harbour of Monaco. If it comes to purely the plants, then the exotic garden of Eze is better, really it is. However the view is equally astonishing and",

          "Spend a good two hours here for \u20ac7.20. Some very colourful varieties other than just the 'dry' cactus type plants. Great view points as you walk round for the harbours and city. It's steep in parts mainly reducing levels from the entrance point, so by the end of the tour",
          "We visited the Exotic Garden in June, with 90 degree heat (Fahrenheit). It was HOT. The shade, trees, and breeze were very welcome. We didn't plan to spend much time in the Garden, mostly just walking through it because we were there. We wound up spending almost 2 hours,",

          "I will preface this review by saying that I am completely fascinated by succulent plants. The Exotic Garden in Monaco is the most striking and awe-inspiring garden I have been to in my life. The diversity of species that have been assembled here since 1933 is a thing of beauty.",
          "We based ourselves in Aix en Provence, rented a car and drove to Monaco from Aix. Prior to arriving in Monaco, we made a stop in Eze. By the time we arrived in Monaco, it was a bit after 10 am. There is a parking garage called L'Engelin where we parked. It is literally across",

          "Visited on a Saturday, bus to the entrance very easy to get there but quite a hike up and down. Although the slopes are gentle there are lots of stairs to get back up once you have reached the observation area. Not recommended if you struggle with steps. Fantastic selection of",
          "It is a bit of a hike to walk up to the gardens but you can get the bus, the signage is not easy to follow. What and amazing view when you get there! This must be the best view of Monaco . Beautiful cactus gardens , not too big, an hours stroll would do it. You can also visit",
          "The Gardens are not large in area but more than compensates with a stunning location on the cliff-side and the variety of plants. Land for the gardens was acquired in 1912 with design and establishment undertaken over the next 20 years. They were opened in 1933. If you are a",
          "Loved every zigzag corner with succulents that must be at least \ud83d\udcaf years old. Exceeded my expectations. If you are fit take the lifts and stairs. The views are well worth it.

          "We were part of a group visiting the famous gardens of the Cote d'Azur and this garden epitomises all that has made the Cote d'Azur famous for its gardens. It is well laid out and maintained and features many mature and stunning plants. As with most of the gardens we visited",
          "The exotice garden at Monaco is situated in the upper area of the town and therefore has several interestings views over the town of Monaco and of course many, bvery interesting succulent plants. Yo\u00fa can get a discount of 1,70 \u20ac when presenting the coupon from the booklet",
          "Gorgeous views, can take about an hour to get around and the views are well worth it Can take either the number 2 bus or walk up the hill",
          "We had been to Monaco before, but this was the first time we had been to these gardens. They are in the top corner of Monaco, and are quite large and well maintained. They are on the side of a hill, and you have to be reasonably fit and mobile to visit them. It is worth visiting",
          "I didn\u2019t find the garden itself very nice, because as the name says it\u2019s full of exotic plants and I prefer the normal colourful ones - if you are interested in plants I\u2019m sure you will love it - but the view from there is the best in Monaco. I think the ticket is around \u20ac8,00",
          "I highly recommend going to this garden if you end up in Monaco. It\u2019s beautiful and interesting with the cacti. It\u2019s a nice contrast to the ritzy feel of Monaco. I give the garden five stars. The garden admission includes the price of an expert tour for some fascinating caves.",
          "A stunning garden above Monaco on the mountainside with a heavenly view: you feel like you are in the paradise! The entrance fee is only \u20ac7.20 which grants you access to visit the maze of the beautiful exotic garden, the anthropology museum and an amazing extra: a prehistoric",
          "This garden exceeded my expectations, precisely because I love cacti and succulents. Truly a beautiful place with amazing views of the city. It is a steep climb up a mountain which we chose to do on foot, erroneously thinking we were \u201calmost there.\u201d If you can, take the bus.",

          "This is a beautiful garden and well designed has a various of cactus with their stories . This beautiful place also has a cave which is really beautiful and interesting . A museum of prehistoric anthropology. The guided tour was really good , he took his time to explain",
          "First of all, the simplest way to get there is to take a No.2 bus from outside the tourist office. The cost is currently 2 euros if you pay on the bus or 1.5 euros if you buy a ticket from the machine. Walking up there is too exhausting and you're likely to arrive in a bad mood",
          "Gosh, there are so many cacti here. There's an interesting mix of flora here, and even a small anthropological museum, and ultimately, you definitely have to come here, even if just for the stunning views of Monaco and La Condamine that the garden gives.",
          "The basic 10-euro (Dec. 2017) ticket entitles you to a visit to the garden, the Observatory cave and the Anthropology museum. A 16-euro combination ticket lets you visit the Oceanographic museum as well (located in a different part of town). The Exotic Garden is tough to reach",
          "Didnt have much time to explore the whole garden coz we arrived late afternoon and they close at 5pm. However from the garden you already have a magnificent view of the whole city and the Prince's Palace . Best time to go is in the afternoon with the sunset . Plants are really",
          "In my opinion, without the cave tour the garden tour would have been a failure. This is also the reason I give it 3 stars. Otherwise I would give it 2 stars. The garden tour is not guided, you just walk through the plants. There are very little to no information regarding the",
          "Nice view of Monaco, full of cactuses, fun to walk around...best to get there by a lot of elevator in different places. Worth it. Price included in Riviera pass.",
          "We visited the garden quite early on a Saturday (10.00) it was good timing we arrived before the crowds. This garden is beautifully designed and maintained with cacti and similar plants from around the world as well as beautiful sculptures. There are places to rest and a much",
          "Gardens are great all different cacti. The guide who took us down the cave was very informative. Very easy to walk round great for wheel chairs.",
          "This is my second visit, although for purposes of photography it is great and for views its stunning, there only seems to be plentiful of cactus types of plantation abd maybe a few of floral, would have prefered more variation of floral blooms, the cave tour was only in French",
          "You can access these gardens by stairs from the harbour with a climb and buildings reminiscent of Hong Kong only cleaner and better maintained. The views on the way up are magnificent as they are from the cactus gardens . The tours for the cave are included and went on the hour",
          "The garden with all it's cacti is beautiful and well organized. The cave is an experience but the guide could have told the story and history behind the descovery of the cave, would have been interesting.",
          "We walked up to the gardens from the main area of Monaco, it was hot! It was a nice garden to walk around lots of cactus, also a cave that you can go into on the hour, allow a couple of hours to visit as it is a nice spot. Get the bus up or down as we did on the way back, only",
          "Visted on Sunday mornong - really quiet and a good time to go. Intriguing amount of cactii and rare palnts laid out through a winding garden.Feels a bit like a maze at timesand would benefit from a more clearly defined map.",
          "Very beautiful place and always very good to see such an nice area. Extremely gentle atmosphere around all the green.",
          "While I agree with what has been said about the view, it is beautiful, the same can be had in many places along that coast without paying an admission. Parking is in a public lot a fair way down the hill and will cost you a few Euro. If you REALLY like cactus this is the place",
          "The garden is located on the slope almost above entire city and as such commands quite good views. Other than that, the choice of plants is limited to various kinds of cacti. One point to note, that the garden is absolutely not navigable for the people with walking",
          "This place is just a short 20 minute walk from the train station. Beautiful, hillside views of Monaco while seeing amazing unique cactus. The cost to get in was 7 Euros but since we got there near the end of the day, we paid 5 Euros. Definitely worth the visit while in Monaco.",
          "The views from the top are unbeatable and you can bag a really breathtaking photo down on Monaco port. I can see why people find the wildlife beautiful, but for me it was quite repetitive as I was under the impression there would be more variety of flowers and plants, rather",
          "Great garden interestingly laid out on the side of the hill. There are great views of the rest of the city - great for taking pictures. The grotto was a highlight of the visit, but you have to take a guided tour (which only happens on the hour so try to plan around that if",

          "You can take bus no. 2 from Monaco Ville. Entrance is about 7 euros and covers the entrance to the caves and the museum also. You can find here many species of exotic plants and trees, especially cactus. Prepare yourself to descend many stairs. The cave tours start each hours",
          "It is a shame these gardens are less well known! A friend and I went on Saturday night about 2 hours before closing - the day was cooling off and there was no crowd whatsoever. It was practically empty! Most of the plants are cacti and succulents but they are beautiful and many",
          "We caught a cab to the palace and walked down through the exotic garden. An absolute must on your visit to Monaco. The atmosphere is peaceful and the views spectacular and on another level \ud83d\udc9a",
          "This is a beautiful but small garden. It's great for a hour or to relax after a full day of Monaco and before you start to drive back.",
          "These gardens are certainly worth a visit, you can combine your entrance fee with other attractions such as the Aquarium which will save you a few euros. The large variety of cacti are worth seeing and the views are perfect for any budding photographers. There is also a small",

          "It was a beautiful garden filled with mostly Cacti. I like Cacti, it was nice to find this plant in this area of Europe. In my mind this is not exotique, but I understand that this may be different for other people. It is not easy to get there by foot. In the map it seems very",
          "Who knew that a beautiful garden in the middle of Monaco could be so relaxing. We took the time to visit this garden during out visit and all enjoyed it a lot. This is a very nice and quiet park that Princess Grace had some part in. It was amazing that even though you could",
          "A Mediterranean garden with plenty of flowers nicely arranged. Have ample benches to sit down and playing areas for kids. Worth a visit after visit to the harbour and the casino.",
          "We hadn't planned to visit this garden but as we were driving into Monaco we spotted the signs and decided to visit. We parked the car in the multi storey next to the garden and the entrance was a short walk down the road. It was all cacti but some amazing species that we hadn't",
          "The garden is well designed with pretty views of the sea and it has a nice gem: a deep cave to explore! You can only descend with a guide (tours every hour, I believe)",
          "The garden is easily accessible from the Monte Carlo Casino- take the Bus No. 2 all the way up to the last stop- Jardin Exotique for 2 euros. Once here, enjoy the stunning landscaped garden leading you to the best breathtaking views of the Monaco !",
          "Finally made it to this garden, incredibly well manicured and laid out. Bit of an incline coming back up, best avoided in the height of summer I imagine. Great spot to escape the high rises, apart from the construction noise from the constantly developing city below. The cave",

          "These gardens were very nice and interested. The views were the best in all of Monaco. Every step we took I wanted to take pictures. We also really enjoyed the cave, a lot of stairs but also a lot of history.",

          "So stunning, astonish. Many kind different of cactus. And more can enjoy the view of City of Monaco. Even on the toilet can see the view of the beautiful Monaco. And don't ever miss the cave!!! So beautiful, magnificent!!!",
          "Everything in Monaco is first class and this is no exception. The park is clean and tidy and neatly clipped. All captions are in English so no problem for me! The cacti are amazing and hang on the side of a cliff giving wonderful views of Monaco and the sea. There is a free",
          "I last visited Jardin Exotique about 15 years ago and as a frequent visitor to Monaco I decided to make a further visit this afternoon.. The gardens are easy to find and can be accessed from the SNCF railway station using the number 2 bus route which criss crosses the",

          "Fabulous gardens and the caves within the gardens are a must see. Entry is reasonable and it takes about 1 hr to do the gardens and 1 hour for the caves. Views over Monaco are spectacular. A really nice place to visit",
          "Was here 20 yes ago, went back this year with our children. The caves are still amazing and nice temperature of 18-20 degr, so no need for the pullovers we brought with us. The view over monaco is also great. Ok pricewise.",
          "Visiting Monte Carlo other than the glitz and the glamour, we were told we really should go here. In the price you don't just get the gardens which are lovely and relaxing with amazing views of the whole principality, but you also get the cave tour and the anthropology museum in",

          "This garden is superb. Cactae of every kind and size. The collection is just mind-boggling. As a Bonus there's even a cave, with guided tour, which has the slowest growing stalagmites/stalagtites. Very unique attraction, highly recomended. The view over Monaco is also splendid.",
          "Not for the faint of heart, or relatively inactive. This Exotic garden takes a lot of work and physical strength to visit, let alone I can't imagine the workers. The succulents and the cave is great, the views spectacular.",
          "Gardens are lovely, it was rather a sunny day and gets rather warm when the sun is beating down. The cave is worth a visit but lots of steps 600 in total. You need to be fairly active as it takes quite a lot out of you I'm 30 and do lots of walking and struggled probably",
          "The gardens on this site are so beautiful, you take a stroll enjoying the flowers and succulents at every turn. The view across Fontville is also impressive, You finish with a tour of the caves, it's narrow and slippery steps need care but well worth the effort",
          "Go for the views, the garden is just an added bonus. I can't even imagine the logistics of building and maintaining a garden on the side of a cliff, not for those with limited mobility or a fear of heights. If I knew what I know now I wouldn't of wasted any time with the museum",
          "We walked both ways and that was challenging - wouldn't recommend it for everyone. The ticket includes the garden, which is a charming collection of succulents and cacti, terraced down the side of the mountain with amazing sea views. Also included is a visit to the extensive",
          "The views are spectacular from the Jardin, but if the caves aren't open then I'm not sure it's worth the trek (easy by bus, or a heckuva hike up!) or the admission price. We combined tickets with the aquarium and saved a few bucks.",
          "We disembarked from a cruise ship in Hercule Port looking for a taxi to drive us around Monaco. We walked for about 10 minutes towards the main road and a sign which said Taxis. There were none in sight but we were told that the #2 bus would take us to the Exotic Gardens. We'd",

          "Beautiful garden with stunning views out over the coast. Well worth the walk up through the village. If you plan on visiting Villa Ephrussi then buy the \u20ac15 combined ticket which is great value!",

          "I don't quite know what we were expecting when we visited the Jardin Exotique. I'm a great fan of botanical gardens, with a mind doubtless conditioned by numberless visits to Kew and Wisley - but the Monaco version was as different from these as can be imagined. It is tucked,",
          "If you want variety and views, then this exotic garden is a great place to visit. I was disappointed by the lack of cafe/dining facilities - but not very surprised after the lacklustre attitude from the staff. Still I wouldn't miss this on your visit, we had a great walk from",
          "I would not try to walk to the gardens from the port; we stopped by on a cruise tour thankfully. High up above Monte Carlo is the Jardin Exotique. The garden contains lots of tropical plant life and had a nice layout that allows you to leisurely stroll through to enjoy",
          "What a lovely, peaceful garden to visit. The sun shone, the sky was blue, views over the old town and port, sea twinkling below, what's not to like. Yes it's hilly, you have to go down to go up as only one entrance at the top of the hill, but No 2 bus drops off right outside,",
          "To enjoy this attraction and Monaco in particular, you need to be a big fan of steps. Not the 90s teen heartthrobs of course, but the means of ascension. Monaco itself, not by design, well partly by design but more by geographical accident is far from the ideal place for those",
          "This is one of my favourite gardens that I have ever visited. It is beautifully laid out with many different types of cacti. The views are amazing as the whole Monaco is in front of you. Very easy to get here on the number 2 bus.",

          "We had a spectacular experience visiting this exotic garden, with its huge plants in a nicely designed garden on a steep cliff with a fantastic view of the bay. The cave is less impressive and if you are not in a good condition enough to add over 300 steps to climb back when",
          "My husband and I went to Monaco for our honeymoon in 1977. Jardin Exotique is beautiful and very different. There are so many different types of cacti, small and large. The garden has wide paths but the incline can be moderately steep as you are going up through the different",

          "I don't recommend visiting the garden for those, who are mad about succulent plants and cactus like me:-) Because there is so many incredible plants that you will go crazy and you will want to have all the plants at home! Now, with an objective eye, it is true that the garden is",

          "We've never seen these unbelievably-shaped cacti before. The location on a cliff that oversees the entire kingdom is also very commanding. The staff wasn't that friendly. The cave was closed, which was a big bummer for my children and finally, the museum was closed. Had we have",
          "You wil,never see so many e species of cacti collected by the Grimaldis. The garden is well marked with all the names and worth the free visit. It also has an amazing view of the rock where the price's palace is located.",
          "Very nice garden to spend 2-3 hours, even if you are not a specialist in cactuses or other plants. The garden is located on the steep hill so you have to use lot's of stairs for up and downs so don't forget to have comfortable shoes on. You'll have plenty of opportunities to",

          "Large range of plants here, including quite a few different cacti. There were also good views of a different part of Monaco.",
          "The exotic garden is nice - if you are looking for very exotic plants, you won't see them here as succulents etc. are similar to what you see in other gardens outside of their native South America. But the view of the Prince's Palace and the water is absolutely spectacular. It",
          "I had read about the Jardin Exotique before my trip, and to be honest, I wasn't all that bothered about it. I ended up going as I had a free afternoon, and I am so glad I went. I'm not an avid fan of plants, but there was still a really interesting and beautiful array to be",
          "The exotic garden has been nice. But in hot and sunny times....it is HOT! So good that there has been a grot to visit, there it has been 18, 5 degrees:) A great view over Monaco.",
          "Having got the number 2 bus to the gardens we arrived at lunch-time to find the restaurant outside the attraction closed. Inside the gardens there is no caf\u00e9 just a few vending machines. It was overcast when we arrived and the light did not do justice to the gardens. We got",
          "There is nothing you can say you dislike there. Is a heaven and you should be grateful you reached there .",
          "This is a pretty good activity to do for the whole family. In terms of its location this can be a challenge if your level of fitness is below par. But saying that Monaco is fantastic as the buses are 1 euro per journey and there is plenty of elevators en route and throughout",
          "Definitely take a bus because it is at the very top of the ridge that comprises Monaco. Due to this, the views are really spectacular. The plants and walks down the hill are nice. There is a cave at the bottom with a guided tour every hour. I was dismayed, however, that",
          "We were somewhat disappointed with this. The setting is great and there are some fascinating succulents. Our disappointment stemmed from getting there and being ready for a cup of coffee in the cafe with views overlooking Monaco. So made our way there (no signs) and found it",
          "If you're infirm and can't manage slopes or steps give this a miss. But if like most of the local pensioners you don't mind a cliff path walk it's an amazing place to visit. So many cactii and succulents, many in flower. We paid 7 Euro to get in. With the ticket price is the",
          "Beautiful and interesting walk would recommend the day was sunny and we had a great time",
          "The gardens themselves are very nice. Lots of plants and trees set high on a cliff overlooking the Rock and the bay. Find the entrance to the cave that goes deep into the cliff. They open the access every hour or so and it is worth the climb down.",
          "My favourite attraction of my weekend visit to Monte Carlo and I'm no gardener!. I loved the colours and the variety and size of the cacti and succulents. Beautifully laid out with windy paths and viewpoints over Monaco and the Riviera. I also went on the tour into the grotto",

          "I try only to review attraction that offer something not available elsewhere and this garden fits firmly in this category. In Monaco I expected to find fast cars, beautiful people and lots of buildings. This exotic garden (and caves) were a real surprise. I've visited lots of",
          "I was a little put off at first about having to pay 4 euros to enter, but I'm so happy I did. I went when it was a little chilly, so if you go in the winter prepare for that. You are very high on top of a mountain afterall. But, I've heard that it's a perfect place to bring a",
          "High above the coast is a lovely area of cacti plants where every corner provides a photo opportunity! There are a few seats and it was nice to take a breather and just admire the view. However the best part of the trip was the visit to the underground caves which are included",

          "From the top end of the Casino Gardens you can take bus no 2 (for one euro) up to Le Jardin Exotique, a cactus garden high up on the hillside overlooking Monaco Ville and Monte Carlo. Admission is seven euros, and it is open from 9.00 until 17.00 or 18.00 in the winter months,",
          "This amazing garden is suspended on a rock. The views of the city, the French and Italian Riviera are breathtaking !",
          "If you never visit this garden, you will leave Monaco without truly understanding it as a place in time. That\u2019s because from the vantage point of the garden at the top of everything else that is built upward toward it, you can see the old city of Monaco as it was in years gone",
          "Peace and tranquillity... perfect garden...in a perfect city...love Monte Carlos...love life!",
          "We didn't know what to expect so it was a lovely surprise! The staff were very pleasant and helpful and the views of the city and both the French and Italian Riviera are stunning! We also did the cave tour with our twin 5 year olds and the guide spoke English and French and was",
          "I enjoyed the cacti, and le jardin is truly beautiful, built on a hillside and well laid out. For those who have mobility issues, this is not the place for you! However, I think I enjoyed the views of Monte Carlo, the palace, and the Mediterranean more than the cacti. It was",
          "Nice garden with lot of Mexican (and some others) cactus. Also many other flowers - though they not at their best on November. Great scenery over Monaco. And if You walk all the way from La Condamine or Monte Carlo, You get also nice excercise!",
          "Apart from the views (it's very high up the hill) there's very little that this Jardin offers to justify 7 euro entry fee. Unless you're a cactus lover, and there's 29754465 different types of cacti, there's very little here. We couldn't even get a tour of the cave as it was",
          "take time to visit and enjoy, we were there for a hour and only one other person was there, a rare thing indeed in Monaco. It is a little haven of peace and where oney does not count for anything..... even rarer in Monaco...",
          "Very enjoyable with lots of shade, a view of the sea and lots of homage paid to Princess Grace. Worth a visit and respite from all of the other tourists. Combine it with a visit to the acquarium and cathedral for a nice way to experience this area.",
          "Reasonably interesting to visit. Expect to do climbing uphill. View of Monaco is nice from there. There is a cave but the guide who takes you down there does not speak English and does not stop for you to catch up with him, and It is quite slippery in there so not really safe",
          "To be honest, we had not planned to visit the Jardin Exotique, but when our plans fell through and we ended up just exploring on foot, our wandering led to the entrance of the gardens. I don't recommend this approach, however, as the gardens are perched high on the hills. A",
          "Very old cactus will amaze the cactus enthusiasts and if you are not, the views are stunning! Well worth the 5 euro entrance fee as there are informative plaques dotted around and you know you are standing on the site where people were looking out for invaders centuries ago.",
          "We took the train from Nice to Monaco. In the train station, you can begin following the signs to the botanical gardens, and then you will \"surface\" pretty high up in the hills (after having taken quite a few escalators), leaving approximately a 15 minute walk to the garden",
          "It's hard to impress this jaded garden lover, as I have been to so many across the world. However, this little gem in Monaco had me thrilled to the marrow. Somebody with a lot of money and a love for cacti managed to build this essentially on the side of a cliff, with fabulous",
          "My wife and I spent about an hour visiting the jardin-exotique, last month. The gardens are OK, but I was horrified when the tour of the Cave began to see & hear that the guide would not speak in English. In protest , we decided not to go on the hour long tour & remonstrated",
          "The botanical gadens were nice. Mostly cactus well presented on fun paths along the hillside. But the joy for us was in the views from the paths. Unobstructed views of all Monaco from a high vantage point. Stunning - bring your camera. The other great surprise was the",
          "I went backpacking with a friend and we decided to take a day off from the museums and casinos to see this beautiful garden. It was gorgeous and I remember we ooh-ed and ahh-ed a lot at the way the flowers and trees were arranged on the paths. It was a nice, easy path, and the",
          "My wife and I happened on the the exotic garden during a casual walk around Monte Carlo. It is an extremely long garden which hangs on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranian. Both my wife and I are devoted to plants (she is a professional horticulturist). This garden provided",

          "Mt. Boron is a hill, mountain between Villefranche and Nice that offers great views of each. There is a park on it with great hiking trails and an old fort. However the reason to visit is the views which are incredible. Take time to visit, you will not be disappointed.",
          "You must visit Mt. Boron when you are in Nice. It is absolutely the most incredible view of the entire city, and the French Riviera. There were people walking the hill, but we took the tour train from Place Messina. It is so worth visiting. You must go!",
          "Great view, well worth the time. Much less crowded. Hikers there is a shorter trail up the north side (inland side) Otherwise drive or. take bus 14. Bring a lunch or snack! There is a locals fitness trail in okay shape thru the woods for those so inclined.",
          "The parc de chateau and tour Bellanda views of the Nice Marina are topped by the views from this point",
          "On Mt. Boron you can / should do the following: - A picnic - Hiking - Sightseeing .... you see the city of nice from one side and Villefranche on the other side. - Go there to watch sunset over Nice .... simply amazing!",
          "Lovely views from the mount across the bay to Cap Ferrat and Eze, lots of olive trees and shaded walks.",
          "We caught the bus from Place Garibaldi. Lovely 1euro bus ride to the end of the line. The superb views are however obscured by the over hanging tree line. One wonders if the City Mayor should introduce a programme of tree pruning to revive this once spectacular view and walk.",
          "the secret little narrow strip beaches that line the coast of the mountain. Discover the nudist beaches if you can find them.",
          "It's a long winding road to get there but once you do it's well worth it. On a sunny day you can see for miles and miles. It's peaceful and relaxing Lots of places to stop off and have a drink.",
          "The views are amazing here, you get a complete panorama, this very good for photographers. There is Fort Alban which is very interesting if you get a guided tour. This is a nice place for a picnic and is only a short drive away from the city and a great escape. There is no caf\u00e9",
          "The views from the mountain was stunning. There are numerous walking paths to explore. Enjoy the seaview from the mountain by siting at one of the many benches provided. I like the wind and the views...very relaxing",
          "Take Bus 14 (Mont Boron) in Nice and get off at Chemin du Fort. The views as the bus ascends is a prelude to how beautiful it is up there. When you get off the bus stop walk to your left for a full view of Nice. The views at Castle Hill are nice but I like these better",
          "Where a fort was buildt by the Architect Vauban, and the Woods are cool all Year long, particularly during summer Time.",
          "I don't care how you get up to Mount Boron, be it with your own rental car, the city bus, something else, but get up there because the views are mind blowing. On one side, all of Nice is exposed for you to see with its amazing coastline and white houses that look just like a",
          "One side gives the whole of Nice and the other Cap Ferat and Villefranche. Not a lot of walking, so the whole trip is only a couple of hours. Do on a clear day. We caught the 14 bus up to Mt Boron. The map at the top is not very easy to follow.... Turn left along the road",
          "Started in Vieux Nice and followed the roads until there were trails to trek up to the top. Once there....amazing views and more trails for hiking and running! There is a workout trail circuit at the top also and then you can hike down to Villefranche sur Mer for lunch and then",
          "Went here via the #80 minibus that leaves from the beach side road at the station in villefranche roughly half past the hour. It's also possible to catch the # 84 from beaulieu. The# 84 takes you to another lovely panorama viewpoint and pizza cafe overlooking the bay as well.",
          "Take bus 14 (from Massena/Guitry or Cathedrale among other stops) to Mont Boron (Chemin du Fort stop) for a break from Nice. There's the old Mont Alban fort to walk around, fabulous views to both Nice side and Villefranche/St Jean Cap Ferrat. Lots of tracks and paths to explore.",
          "If you're feeling fit... Walk from the port around the bay past the lucky residences that have the incredible views and daily sunsets. Drop down and tw the path around to the Cap de Nice late afternoon and take in a stunning sunset... And make a wish that one day you could",
          "We walked this in an hour from Villefranche old town following the yellow route. The steps up from the Boulevard Princess Grace are fairly steep and with nothing much to see, but once up at the top the view from the fort mont Alban were amazing; Villefranche-sur-mer to Beaulieu",
          "Depends what you like really. The mount is picturesque but it's really one of the places where the rich & famous live, for example, Sean Connery 007 and Elton John. If you like looking at their houses, fine - if not, skip this - there's plenty more to do.",
          "Go up in the tourist train to the top enjoy the views all round over Nice and East to Villefranche. See the super yachts and ferries busily criss crossing with yachts and speedboats. Enjoy the walk down through the old town to the flower market. Lots of cafes and gardens for a",
          "The #14 bus will take you up to this almost deserted spot from which you can walk to magnificent views of Villefranche, Nice and the Mediterranean. No services there, though, just a fountain for our thirst (we kind of thought there'd be a small shop or something, but no). It's a",
          "Walked up following a eco-walk. It is quite steep but not difficult and the views from the top are outstanding. Also great to see such natural forest so close to the city and so well used",
          "We walked up here from the town centre and although it was a bit hot (end of August), the climb was well worth it for the sunset views we had over Nice and the surrounding area. Very quiet and tranquil, good for wildlife spotting.",
          "Like other reviewers we took the number 14 bus to the top of mt. Boron then walked down the road to the main coast road. This takes longer than the escalier de verre but its an easier route . When you reach the mian road cross over (taking great care as it is a very busy road)",
          "The No 14 bus (Fare \u20ac1) takes you from the centre of Nice up to this promontory between Nice and Villefranche. You can walk up to Fort Alban from where there are tremendous views east over Villefranche and Cap Ferrat. It is also possible to walk down via the escalier de verre to",
          "We accidentally drove around and down Mt. Boron on our way back from the Rothschild Villa. The views are fantastic. A must see.",
          "The views are magnificent and Mt Boron is not too far from Nice either. We did enjoy our picnic there a lot.",
          "Just a short bus ride from Nice cost 1\u20ac is well worth the lovely views and peaceful atmosphere.Do take water and snack as not easy to find the one cafe."

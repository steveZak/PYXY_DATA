        "wiki": "The Palais des Papes (English: Palace of the Popes; lo Palais dei Papas in Occitan) is a historical palace located in Avignon, Southern France. It is one of the largest and most important medieval Gothic buildings in Europe. Once a fortress and palace, the papal residence was the seat of Western Christianity during the 14th century. Six papal conclaves were held in the Palais, leading to the elections of Benedict XII in 1334, Clement VI in 1342, Innocent VI in 1352, Urban V in 1362, Gregory XI in 1370 and Benedict XIII in 1394.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Palais is actually two joined buildings: the old palais of Benedict XII, which sits on the impregnable rock of Doms, and the new palais of Clement VI, the most extravagant of the Avignon popes. Together they form the largest Gothic building of the Middle Ages. It is also one of the best examples of the International Gothic architectural style. The construction design was the work of two of France\u2019s best architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean de Louvres, and the lavish ornamentation was the work of two of the best students of the School of Siena (Italy), Simone Martini and Matteo Giovanetti.\nIn addition, the papal library housed in the Palais (the largest in Europe at the time with over 2,000 volumes), attracted a group of clerics passionate in the study of \"belles-lettres\", amongst them the founder of humanism, Petrarch. At the same time, composers, singers and musicians were drawn to the Great Chapel of the Palais. It was there that Clement VI used the Mass of Notre-Dame of Guillaume de Machaut, there that Philippe de Vitry at the pope\u2019s invitation presented his Ars Nova, and there that Johannes Ciconia came to study.\nDue to its immense size, the Palais was also the place where the general organisation of the Church began to change. It facilitated the centralisation of services and the adaptation of operations in order to suit the needs of the papacy, creating a truly central administration for the Church. The manpower of the Curia (Church administration), while 200 at the end of the 13th century, surpassed 300 at the beginning of the 14th century and reached 500 people in 1316. To this were added over 1,000 lay officials working within the Palais.Despite this, the Palais became obsolete when the papacy found it necessary to return to Rome. The hope of reuniting Latin and Orthodox Christians, along with the achievement of peace in the Papal States in Italy, made the case of returning stronger. Added to that was the strong conviction of both Urban V and Gregory XI that the seat of the papacy could only be the tomb of St Peter. Despite strong opposition from the Court of France and the College of Cardinals, both popes found the means to return to Rome, the first, on 30 April 1362, the second on 13 September 1370. This time, the return was absolute.In the following centuries, the Palais lost all of its former glory, despite serving as the seat of two anti-popes and many cardinals. It retained, however, a \u201cwork of destruction\u201d aspect that French poets and writers such as Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert have referred to over the centuries, with its powerful sense of beauty, simplicity, grandeur and immortality.Since 1995, the Palais des Papes has been classified, along with the historic center of Avignon, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, under cultural criteria i, ii and iv.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Palais construction began in AD 1252. Avignon became the residence of the Popes in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as Pope Clement V, unwilling to face the violent chaos of Rome after his election (1305), moved the Papal Curia to Avignon during the \"Avignon Papacy\". Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor Pope John XXII set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops' palace was begun in earnest by Pope Benedict XII (1334\u201342) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river Rh\u00f4ne, was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the Palais Vieux (Old Palace) and Palais Neuf (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of 11,000 m2 (118,403 sq ft). The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy's income during its construction.\nThe Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of Pope Benedict XII. The austere Benedict had the original episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centred on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.\n\nUnder Popes Clement VI, Innocent VI and Urban V, the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. An architect, Jean de Louvres, was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a 52 m long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court d'Honneur) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures and wooden ceilings.\n\nThe popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the Papal Schism during which time the antipopes Clement VII and Benedict XIII made Avignon their home until 1403. The latter was imprisoned in the Palais for five years after being besieged in 1398 when the army of Geoffrey Boucicaut occupied Avignon. The building remained in the hands of antipapal forces for some years \u2013 it was besieged from 1410 to 1411 \u2013 but was returned to the authority of papal legates in 1433.\nAlthough the Palais remained under papal control (along with the surrounding city and Comtat Venaissin) for over 350 years afterwards, it gradually deteriorated despite a restoration in 1516. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789 it was already in a bad state when it was seized and sacked by revolutionary forces. In 1791 it became the scene of a massacre of counter-revolutionaries, whose bodies were thrown into the Tour des Latrines in the Palais Vieux.\n\nThe Palais was subsequently taken over by the Napoleonic French state for use as a military barracks and prison. Although it was further damaged by the military occupation, especially under the anti-clerical Third Republic when the remaining interior woodwork was cleared away for use of the structure as a stables \u2013 the frescos were covered over and largely destroyed \u2013 this ensured the shell of the building's physical survival. It was vacated in only 1906, when it became a national museum. It has been under virtually constant restoration ever since.\nCharles Dickens describes a tour around this building in his book:Pictures from Italy. His guide he describes as a she-devil with flashing black eyes who glories in the gory past when the building was used as a torture chamber.\n\n\n== Present ==\n\nThe Palais is today a historical and architectural landmark and primarily a tourist attraction, attracting around 650,000 visitors per annum, putting it regularly in the top ten most visited attractions in France. It also houses a large convention centre and the archives of the d\u00e9partement of Vaucluse, which include a research centre on the papacy of Avignon, organised jointly by the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome and the institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes.\nThe Palais regularly serves as an exhibition centre. The first major exhibition was initiated by Ren\u00e9 Char, in the Grand Chapel between 27 and 30 June 1947. Entitled \"Exposition de peintures et sculptures contemporaines\" (Exposition of contemporary painters and sculptors), it was the starting point for what would later become the Festival d'Avignon.The courtyard of the Palais des Papes is a central performance location during the Festival d'Avignon, which is held every year in July. It is also the site of many cultural and economic events including exhibitions, shows, and conventions.\nThe Palais is also home to the International Congress Centre, which was established in 1976 and today hosts a large number of events annually. These include congresses, parliaments, symposia, reunions and other gatherings, with the largest room, the 'Grande Audience', able to hold up to 700 guests.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nWith 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor space, the Palais is the largest Gothic palace in all of Europe and, due to its many architectural merits, one of the most important in the world. These merits were highlighted by Viollet-le-Duc, author of \u201cDictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle\u201d (Dictionary of French architecture from the 11th to the 16th century), who referred extensively to the Palais, including the thickness and height of its towers, the strength of its crenelated walls, the use of arcs for support on its fa\u00e7ades and its ability to withstand heavy and drawn-out sieges.\n\n\n=== The towers ===\n\n\n=== Cl\u00e9ment VI studium ===\n\nThe studium, or private study of Clement VI, is commonly called the chambre du cerf (room of the deer), on account of the justly-celebrated 14th-century frescoes, depicting courtly hunting scenes, that decorate the walls and vaults. The subject matter, while common in contemporary secular art, is as unexpected in a room supposedly dedicated to study as it is for a room in a papal apartment. The frescoes were probably painted by French artists, who were either highly influenced by Sienese art or assisted by Simone Martini and/or Matteo Giovanetti, both of whom served as Clement's court painter.\n\n\n=== The Great Tinel ===\nThis room was used primarily as a reception room. Covered with tapestries on starry blue background, there is actually nothing left of these sets. Indeed, a fire destroyed the palace in the 14th century: many parts have been restored or rebuilt.\nDuring conclaves, it is in this room that the cardinals met to elect a new pope. For the occasion, the room was walled and only a small opening was left open to provide all the necessary food. After each conclave, the walls were destroyed, revealing a vaulted room opening to the rest of the palace.\n\n\n=== The chapels ===\n\n\n==== Saint-Martial chapel ====\n\nLocated on the second level of the Saint-Jean tower, the Saint-Martial chapel relates through painting the main parts of Saint Martial's life. Matteo Giovanetti worked there in 1344 and 1345. The reading direction of the painting should be made from top to bottom.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Saint-Jean chapel ====\n\nFrom 1347 to 1348, Matteo Giovannetti was in charge of the Saint-Jean chapel, located under the Saint-Martial chapel.\n\n\n== Art exhibitions at the Palais des Papes ==\nThe Palais des Papes regularly hosts art exhibitions. The tradition began in 1947, when the art critic Christian Zervos and the poet Ren\u00e9 Char organised an exhibition of the likes of Matisse, Picasso, Braque and Mondrian. The exhibitions shown since then include two exhibitions of Picasso (in 1970 and 1973), the comprehensive 2000 exhibition \u201cLa beaut\u00e9 in fabula\u201d and, more recently, the exhibition \u201cLes Papesses\u201d (2013) and single exhibitions of Miquel Barcel\u00f3 (2010) and Stefan Szczesny (2014).\n\n\n== See also ==\nPalace of the Popes (disambiguation)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)\nThe Popes Palace, visit and report\nVisit the Pope's Palace and Avignon",

          "A must see. I enjoyed the interactive guide and 3D visualisations. Finding the coins hidden in the 3D animation was fun and should keep children interested (unfortunately the device stopped working towards the end which meant no last coin = no prize). DO - get a 0Eur banknote",

          "I think there is only one thing to say STUNNING, truly stunning. If you are less mobile choose your route carefully, the one I chose was very steep uphill with a lot of stairs and cobbles. If you use one of the main entrances the path is gentle. Well worth the visit",

          "I think this building is really more impressive from the outside than the inside. Yes, the views from the top are amazing and yes, it is rich in history. The issue that my wife and I had was that the audio guide we received was only somewhat helpful. There is nothing really",
          "The Palais is huge .It is empty of furniture but its grandeur will definitely bring you back to the 14 th century. Give yourself enough time to visit for you will not want to miss climbing all the way to the top tower . You\u2019ll be snapping pics of the breathtaking views of",
          "The room signage is 95% in french and the rooms are in their original condition. The names on the excellent ipad guide are in English and the pictures are enhanced SO its very difficult to identify which room you are currently in most of the time. For any room with a black",
          "You have to be impressed with the grandeur of the palace, so much built in a short time for the pope\u2019s place and the seat of the bureaucracy. The audio guide was frustrating as was the lack of signage directing us. Construction closed some rooms, and the admission was reduced",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the Papal Palace even with the number of stairs that you need to climb and descend during a tour. Although most rooms have no furniture, it is not hard to visualise the grandeur of furnishings. We also booked tickets to see the sound and light",
          "A gothic architectural treasure! Touring the Palais des Papes is a highlight of a visit to Avignon. Tours are self-guided with a virtual reality tour provided on a tablet. The tour is offered in several languages and one is able to see what the rooms would have looked like in",
          "the digital guide/histopad was really cool, showing how the rooms used to look, and gave interesting details as to the building's history! very engaging, informative and fun!",
          "The histopads at the Palace are a fantastic device to bring not only audio to the tour but also computer graphics showing how many of the rooms would have looked like back in the day. Great idea. Got there at opening time and missed all the crowds.",
          "We had been to Avignon but hadn't visited the Palais. We spent a couple hours there. They have this awesome interactive display, showing what the room you are standing in would have looked like when the Popes lived there. Worth the money and the time!",
          "The visual aides were really good and made the rooms seem real. The cost was reasonable and the palace easy to get around",
          "This is a must-see museum during your stay in Avignon in order to understand the look and feel of the city. The media displays show the wealth of the Papes; this wealth created the architecture in Avignon.",
          "We had a private localguide take us through the Palace and it was really wonderful to hear bring the building's history to life. The palace is empty but they have tv monitors that tou can scroll through the pictures to see what the Palce looked like during its peak period. A few",
          "I learn a lot about the history of the Catholic church and their Popes from visiting this place. And heard many stories about their contributions to the city of Avignon.",
          "If I'm not mistaken, this iconic building is what made Avignon famous. When the Pope ran away from Rome, he stayed here. I absolutely love the medieval structures and architecture of the buildings. Tickets to enter can be bought online or at the venue. I got mine online only",
          "You would expect the palace where popes resided for over 100 years when moved away from Rome to be very lavish, perhaps not like the Sistine Chapel, Rome ornately painted ceilings but some features of the bygone lavish styles.. Sadly no. Large rooms, impressive, but devoid of",
          "We were astonished at the huge size of this building - the Papal palace when Popes lived and held court in Avignon. Yet it had been even larger before parts of it were knocked in down in later centuries. After security you get a Histopad - a tablet preloaded with a variety of",

          "This tour was part of our cruise and I thought when they said there were a lot of steps they meant on the outside but that was not the case, there are many steps up and down throughout. Extremely well preserved, the rooms do not have any furniture so you have to use your",
          "All ticket holders are given a tablet/screen & audio guide to wear around their necks to help them imagine what the rooms were like back in the day. Possibly helpful, though you might (as I did) simply prefer to look around the bare rooms just as they are. Worth a visit, though",
          "This is one you can't miss. The architecture and history is incredible. Plus, they have an awesome audiovisual guide that adds so much to the experience",
          "Really enjoyed this visit.the palace is very impressive and wonderful. The audio tablet is an excellent aid. A very impressive site to visit.",
          "Well worth visiting - we loved it. Walk around with interactive ipad and \"time portals\". Easy to access all rooms.",
          "We only walked around the outside. It is fairly well restored and looks impressive. Did not bother with entrance fee to go inside.",
          "Enjoyed the visit. Audio guide was very helpful seeing the palace alive as it was used and decorated.",
          "Very interesting place. Was not aware the pope had a resided outside of Italy but then, I\u2019m not that keen on the history of the Pope. Have been to the Vatican and there is no comparison. So the Pope lived here in the 14th century. Very small window high on the wall in his room.",
          "The visit to the Pope's Palace was extremely interesting. The use of tablets that are handed out at the beginning of the tour really brings the life at the palace more real. My husband and I are very happy we went on this tour.",
          "A lovely tourist Attraction in Avignon. Allow a good two hours to follow the Audio Guide and Explore the numerous areas and rooms. Need to be mobile as stairs to Climb. This is a must.",
          "The standout attraction in Avignon, and the ability using the Histopad to see what many rooms would look like during the time of the Papal occupancy was great! Took me a while to get the hang of all it\u2019s features, but it certainly added to the experience!!",
          "The self guided \u2018Histopad\u2019 tour of the Palais des Papes is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Very informative with lots of reconstructions to help illustrate what life in the past was like. Would heartily recommend",

          "Spent over two hours here, could have been more. Amazing interactive iPad and commentary. Such a lot of history.",
          "Very mixed feelings. In Avignon this is the must see attraction. That is both good and bad. We went at 10 am, an hour after opening and the tour bus crowds were in full swing. Weird for a Monday almost past prime season. So that was a pain. They gave us a mini iPad for an",
          "This is one of those historic buildings that you just have to visit. Huge site with a lot of walking and climbing. On entry you get an iPad type device and headphones that give a full commentary. Expect to spend at least 2, 3 hours",
          "Astounding piece of history that is worth spending time exploring. We went and there were not too many tour groups or other tourists. Fantastic large complex with good displays and visual aids.",
          "Didn't go in but sat in cafe and had chocolat chaud and tarte tartane in the square beside after dinner. Lit up beautifully and impromptu opera singer appeared and busked for 30 minutes. Magical moment",
          "If you visit here in the summer, I would recommend to buy on-line tickets instead of buying the tickets at the counter. While the palace was empty, we were given a tablet that has the programme of the whole place. It was really easy to use as you only have to scan a QR code in",
          "If you go during the Summer, be ready for the crowds. I highly recommend buying tickets on-line as that gets you into the building. They have to come up with a better way of issuing the tablet guides as that was a total cluster. Once you get through that, the palace is large",
          "The huge French Papal palace dominates this medieval city and is amazing in its proportions. While essentially empty, the tour in 2 successive walks clearly demarcates the older and \"newer\" sections. On entry we received a pre-programmed tablet with earphones, which made a",

          "The palace is at the opposite end of the walled city to the railway station. Not a long walk. You don't get to see all that much inside but it's interesting nevertheless. Quite a lot of steps to climb if you have problems climbing stairs.lots of restaurants and cafes in the",
          "Spent an afternoon walking through this amazing palace. The history is fascinating. But the best part was the Histopad, which provided an audio and visual tour, showing you what each room would have looked like at the time the popes lived here. I wish all museums had this guide",

          "Our second visit and still as majestic and special, not to be missed. They now provide an interactive iPad for the visit, which did provide some detail to allow you to visualise how it would have been decorated. However do take time to just absorb the magnificent rooms, their",

          "The histopads and earphones were a bit clunky but the overlay effect of each room by year was pretty cool. The layout of the tour is clear and easy to follow. There were not a lot of actual artifacts exhibited but the a lot of material was presented via poster boards and the",

          "This was a must see site in Avignon. We did just the regular visit with the tablet guide. I admit the tablet (histopad) was somewhat hard to grasp at first and took us a bit to figure it all out. But it was a very nice addition for touring the palace and really understanding",
          "A very well guided visit to this extensive establishment of 9 Popes. What space was enjoyed, what luxuries (of their day), what wealth was stored here. A must to visit when in Avignon.",
          "It makes a difference visiting the palace where the 9 Avignon Popes lived. It is indeed a palace. I also learned about what happen to this property of the Vatican. They lost it during the French Revolution and the place is now run by the government. It is partly used as a",
          "Although several of its important rooms are closed to the public, the Palace of the Popes exemplifies both life in the Middle Ages and how ingeneous were its architects in being able to remove walls in order to hold a conclave, and fill the wall back in after the papal election.",

          "Did visit Avignon to see the palais des papes. First of all, Avignon is worth a visit by it self. An old and very charming town. Just wander round in the central parts, stop at a restaurang, enjoy the surroundings and you will be satisfied! Palais des papes is a marvelous",
          "Something new for us was using a computer tablet that not only gave information, but in some rooms, you could link up and scan the room, which would then take you back in history. When you lifted the tablet to the walls suddenly they were decorated in the period in which it had",
          "This was one if the best things we did in Provence. The tour is made so interesting by the use of the interactive pad. I also noticed activities within the media for children. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "You cannot really visit Avignon without going around the Palace des Papes, but I found it quite disappopinting. The hi-tech pads for information were not easy to use and sometimes did not work at all. There are a great many stairs and steps, but the views from the rooftop are",
          "Good value for entry fee 10.00 euros with additional 5 Euros to walk on the Bridge. returned for a late afternoon visit to avoid morning queues walked straight in (august) Good audio guide. Toilets on site , gift shop and restaurant. Opened till around 8pm. (check website)",

          "The palace is an amazing and dominant feature to the city. It\u2019s grand and impressive. Very well done with the tablets to give visuals and narration. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Absolutely astonishing collection of art and sculpture,beautifully presented with details of the history of the collection on audio/visual portable aids",
          "This is the main point of interest in Avignon. From outside it looks good. Cleaned walls, high towers. For a good picture try to get there in the morning, the earlier is the better. We did not go inside.",
          "A massive, impressive palace located at a beautiful square. If it wasn't for the small shops and many restaurants, you could see yourself back a few hundred years. The visit to the castle is interesting, but the castle is rather empty, not a lot left.",
          "Just beautiful, especially when you think this has been build many many years ago. The garden around it is nice as well and you have a great view.",

I would",

I find this a bit distracting though as I\u2019m not looking at the real thing, just a cartoon image. Our children enjoyed",

          "Palais des Papes was stunning and well worth it. You get given iPads with earphones to do a self tour and it\u2019s incredible. You can just take your time and wonder around. We booked our tickets online so we got to skip the long line out in the sun so I advise to do the same!",
          "We walked through Avignon on a guided tour (Friday 31st May) to the papal palace which is an incredible structure containing the most enormous rooms. Between 1309 and 1377 seven Popes lived in the palace. Our guide Emmanuel (Manu) was excellent and surprised everyone by",

          "In spite the insufferable mid morning heat the visit to the Palais des Papes was well worth it. The building is a marvel of 14th architecture and achievement. Any historian or aspiring historian will have a feast!!",

          "Their audio guide here was great. It had geotags and gave additional information when you scanned your tablet. There were also translations at each area with text that included details that the audio guide did not include about the popes who lived in the palace. My husband and I",

          "I waited many years for this visit and found it engrossing and informative. The IPAd tour is quite innovative. However....the Avignon Festival runs thru most of July and this means TONS of people in town that month. Try to go in June instead. Second, Festival events are often",
          "We visited the palace with our grownup kids. We especially liked the histopads a tablet that showed all the information on the rooms visited. Also it shows the rooms as they were when the palace was in use many years ago.",
          "This is a great piece of history and a must see landmark in Avignon. The audio visual device is state of the art, allowing you to see what each room might have looked like in its original form. The tour took us two hours but more time would have been nice.",
          "It was a great experience to visit this place. They offer audio guide and show kindly each chamber and explain about the usage and history. My daughter learned about history of Avignong and enjoy it a lot. Necessary to visit",
          "While in Avignon there was the theatre festival, so I could only visit the gardens and a small chapel as the Palais was closed. Gardens are wonderful and offer a beautiful view of the city! It\u2019s definitely a must!",
          "It was so impressive and large you need at least 3 hours to see everything. Thanks to the palace's highly functional histoguide, the self-guided tour was manageable and less stressful. A visit to the rooftop allowed the panoramic view of the city. A little secret I found, which",
          "Superb building and history all brought realistically to life by the interactive Ipad guide. We loved the treasure hunt and were absorbed by it, we even backtracked when we realised we had missed out the kitchen with its enormous chimney. Good views from up on the roof. Great",
          "Very interesting place but extremely hot! We only saw a couple of fans in the gift shop and staff areas. If we had known it was going to be this hot inside we would certainly not have spent 30 euros for visiting an oven!",
          "This must be seen with a private tour guide and I have the best for you!! So much history here , one must go with someone e who knows their stuff! A beautiful Palais- well kept and offer iPads to view the way it was back centuries ago. I feel blessed to have walked on the",
          "The tour is very high tech, with a Ipad- like guide that shows what the rooms looked like. The history of the papal split and its impact could have been explained much more.",
          "Visited here on a baking hot day in July. It was an impressive building and we liked the tablets they gave out which took you back in time and showed how the palace looked in its heyday. We thought it was good value for money. Would definitely recommend for those visiting",
          "Great place to visit. It is well preserved and interesting But what really sets the place apart is how the self guides work. You get an iPad and headphones that tells you about each room. But it is highly interactive: as you point the iPad at the walls in a room, the screen",
          "It is one of those UNESCO site for a reason The history of this site is rich and spectacular. (Sans the dan brown sort of way) Anyone who is into the period church history must visit at least once. I agree with other reviewers, it is too crowded. I know with the fame comes the",

          "There is a fantastic audio visual guide for the Palais des Papes unlike anything I have ever seen before. It's like an IPad that has screen and audio for every room in the Palais. Although most of the rooms are fairly empty, there is a platform in each room with a symbol on",
          "Visited this must see place and were amazed by the construction and architecture as-well as the history of the place. It was very warm and abit crowded when we visited and they had a massive stage/seat construction in the courtyard. Im not sure if its stationary or if it was",
          "The palace itself is quite an interesting place to visit. The self guided audio tour is a must if you visit. It is very informative. The highlight for me however, was the art exhibit at the end of the trip. Currently running is an exhibition of art and photographs by Ernest",
          "The guide really brought this place to life. The scavenger hunts were really good for our teenager. The guide also showed what the facility looked like when at the height of its power. We spent about an hour and a half here.",
          "We visited on a ridiculously hot day but even with that this was a cool place to visit. They provide tablets to help guide you through the palace and provide more detail on how it used to look back in the day. There is a nice garden area and a path to the broken bridge.",
          "This is a Christian historic relic of epic proportions. Not what I\u2019d call an architectural marvel though. The info pads were OK but more of a distraction than anything to be honest. Had a bit of a challenge keeping our group together and finding the right way through!",
          "We have visited Palais des Papes before, but not with kids and not since the adoption of HistoPads. We were in Avignon during a heatwave and it was a cool respite from the hot sun and with the addition of walking around with the iPad, participating in the treasure hunt, the",

          "The interior is mostly empty, but they've got a Histopad that attempts to recreate it for you. I learned a lot and enjoyed the tour.",
          "Very nice place, but nothing special things to see. Nice to walk around and take photos... Be just and watch the places as u think how they were made.",
          "We arrived late in the afternoon and walked around Avignon. The next morning, we headed to Palais de Papas. The tour was magnificent. I'm a tech geek and I loved the use of the ipad and VR to augment the tour. It had a game to find things in the castle. It also allowed you",
          "Awesome place. Especially at night with the lights. It is enormous. Well worth seeing. Not hard to find",
          "Avignon became the Pontifical residence under Pope Clement V in 1309. For those who are interesting in history and architectur have to visit the Palais des Papes. Seven popes and two anti-popes resided in Avignon. We had an audio/video-guide. You could see the rooms as they are",
          "The largest Gothic palace in Europe, quite impressive from the outside walking into the city. The new \u2018virtual reality\u2019 experience with the Histopads is a nice effort, though it should be enhanced if you really want to engage people in this place\u2019s history. The current method",

          "We enjoyed our visit to the palace/fortress of the popes. It wasn't overly crowded, and we got a feel for how the rich and famous lived in the 14th century. It was interesting to compare the spare walls with the overwhelming treasures of the Vatican. The best part of our visit",
          "After visiting the markets in L\u2019Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, my fianc\u00e9 and I made our way to Avignon to see the Palais des papas. They have an amazing tour that turns every room into how it would look in the 13th century! Truly fun for the whole family!",
          "We didn\u2019t take the tablets that they give you at the beginning. We wanted to see the building ourselves. It\u2019s pretty and every where there are signs/explanations in English so you don\u2019t need a tablet.",
          "We expected an interesting building because of its role in the Avignon Papacy, and we were not disappointed. What came as a pleasant surprise, though, was the way it was presented, using sophisticated tablet-style devices. The device always knows where it is in the building, so",
          "Wow, wow and wow! The Palace is breathtaking and spectacular. You are provided with an audio guide and each room has a point where you stand and the guide tells you the history, etc. The tour of the Palace is easy to follow and would highly recommend if visiting Avignon.",
          "You receive an iPad with dual lingo script. It is very easy to follow along. Cost 12.00euro per adult well spent. Clean washrooms.",
          "Good value for a visit including a clever audio pad guide, available in English. Very busy, as you would expect of such a national treasure, but it flows quite well because of the guide. My only complaint is that the headphones for the audio pad are terribly difficult to keep",
          "We expected a normal tour, like all the others in the past but it was not. We got a tablet and the interaktiv tour started automatically. The explanations were very good and interesting, you have to move the tablet around the room and get the historical picture of it. On",
          "Reading through some reviews we must have been extremely lucky with our visit. No queue whatsoever to get in, and once inside although of course many tourists, we had all the time to explore the building in our own time and manner. The audio guide is a must have as the rooms",
          "Magnificent vist, with a excellent visual aid on the tablet. It really helps you to get a good view on how it was in the 14th century",
          "Do get the augmented reality app. If you just go through this on own it\u2019s a bit of a trap because it\u2019s all renovated. It also doesn\u2019t have much in good views and spots. Mostly Internal facing so less to see. Just a check off the list spot.",
          "Arrived in Avignon in a 35 degree heatwave and thought we would give the Palace a try to stay out of the heat. Admission comes with a free tablet and audio guide and directs you around the rooms of the palace that was used as the Popes residency for nearly a century in the",
          "Arrive early to avoid the crowds and the heat but definitely don\u2019t miss this extraordinary site! The histopad provides the interesting information but I did get tired of carryover carrying it.",
          "Make sure you visit the Pope\u2019s Palace - it was the highlight of Avignon! We went at 9:30am and there was minimal crowd (got our tickets with no queue). The audio guide was incredible with augmented reality showing you how each room would look like back in the day. My teens had",
          "On the hottest day in France since modern records compiled, it wasn't the best day to explore this splendid city. However we were determined to make it to the Popes Palace. We were not disappointed. Thankfully it was cool inside. You can take a combined ticket to cover this and",
          "Lovely audio/ video guide for visitor. Lovely special building with some art exhibition during visit",
          "Did not go in for a tour, but just the sheer size of this fortified home is impressive. Wonderful architecture. A must-see when in Avignon.",
          "The popes palace really does stand out in this beautiful city. This was the first time I was able to use an iPad virtual tour as the audio guide which was fantastic. It really allowed you to get the VR experience of what it was like in a different point of history while still",
          "During my short - 3-hours - visit to Avignon, the most attractive was visit to Papal Palace, and the most interesting was taking the boat across the river Rone (it is free).",
          "brilliant tour and they have an I-Pad virtual treasure hunt for kids (and grown ups too...shhhh) great value in an incredible place",
          "The audioguide tour with visual on the tablet was very nice. Tour only took 1 hour. Was hoping it would last a little longer. Ended quite abruptly. History behind it was interesting. Would not do tour without audioguide!",
          "We saw the popes palace on our first day in the city, and despite the pouring rain the queue was massive. We resolved to get up early the next morning to beat the crowds, and this paid off nicely as we strolled in sans queue. This place is absolutely amazing. A treasure trove of",
          "Bought tickets online and arrived to almost no line. The audio tour included an iPad with GPS positioning and virtual reality to show how the rooms would have looked in the 1300s. Really cool technology!",
          "Amazing structure and I think it worthy of a visit. I am always impressed with the architectural features of these old buildings. Recommend visiting.",
          "If it were not for the free histopad that is lent to you once you have paid, this would have been a mediocre tour. There are a few lovely murals but for the rest, there are bare empty rooms. Still worth a visit to see the stupidity of \"religion\".",
          "There is a lot of history here, and the structure is in superb condition. The ipad guide is pretty good, but it still has some bugs that need to be worked out. Not sure it is really worth the trouble at this point, because the palais is so overwhelming and impressive. The gift",
          "How does anyone rate this as \"Poor ?\" This is a beautiful example of medieval architecture. It is just beyond downtown, just after all the restaurants. Yes, it involves some walking. Technology (pads) allows one to hear the history, see the rooms as they once were and gives you",
          "Another great example of the architecture of the late medieval period. Obviously unmissable if you are in Avignon. There is small lovely park on the left, with a great view of the Pont d\u2019Avignon.",
          "We extremely enjoyed our visit. We were given a Tablet and earphones which enables seeing the Palais as it originally was.",
          "Back in 2017 I undertook a guided tour of the Vatican Museums and became captivated by the history of the Papacy. However the visit felt like a jigsaw missing a piece, since the Papacy was predominately based in Avignon between 1309 and 1377, while the city continued to elect",
          "If you're expecting loads of decorated rooms, you will leave disappointed. Most rooms are bare with few frescoes remaining, but there are collections of artefacts in each room. The rooms are brought to life by the free pad everyone receives upon entering. Quite easy to use",
          "The admission includes an interactive multimedia audio tour guide through out the Palais. It gives you some 3D reconstruction images to help you \u201ctravel back in time\u201d. This historic site also offers some nice view of Avignon and even the surroundings are worth a walk if time",
          "Good. enjoyed it....i don't want to say more but hv to fill up 100 chars. Make sure you drop in to the cave cellar door on the way walking down to the village",
          "The Palais is bare bones today but the current audio guide gives you a full perspective of the Palais interior trappings during the pope's stay in Avignon. Detailed descriptions in each room via audio guide. Great experience and learned a great deal.",
          "Sometimes it is hard to imagine how ancient buildings looked when in use more than 500 years ago. Your admission to the Palais des Papes includes a time machine that allows you to see the rooms back in the day - magnificently recreated using tablet technology. Very cool! Also",
          "Although it is a very impressive building, it still is not outstanding architecture. However, it has great value as part of all the developments of Europe. It\u2019s halls are impressive and the statues are very good.",
          "The first sighting of Le Palais as we entered the grounds will remain with me always. A magnificent edifice. The tour around the building just got better and better as we moved from room to room. The Histopad brought history to life and enhanced the experience without a doubt.",
          "Well kept, well organized small museum! Enjoyed to see things from 1300s! Recommed to visit early in the morning when there is no line!",
          "I was not quite prepared for the massive scale of the Palais des Papes, but immediately appreciated its superb late Gothic facade and its incredible state of preservation. Inside, the available audio tour is a great addition to what you are seeing--explains and puts what is",
          "We planned this around some business and we were not disappointed in our day at the Palace. They have a audio tour system that helps you to see what the palace looked like in 1300. After years of renovations and in some cases, allowing for areas not redone, you get a sense of",
          "Tour of the Palais des Papes is a must. The interactive multimedia experience that has been built into the tour is a great way to provide information and clarity to individuals who are not a part of a group booking!",
          "The visit to the Les Palace des Papes was terrific experience thanks to the \u2018iPad\u2019 type device that\u2019s included in the 12Euro per person entrance fee. The device visually transforms each key room into it\u2019s former glory so that you can see and hear what it may have been like many",
          "Hanging around the front of the palace in the evening to share a glass of wine is simply a delight. Stop by there around aperitif hour when the sun starts to set lighting up the facade of the palace. Exquisite \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",
          "The history behind this Palis is amazing to think that at one time the catholic church had two different popes that were in two different countries. This is such a great work, well worth seeing",
          "The Palais stands tall in the lovely town of Avignon. Before it, a beautiful plaza. The building is enormous, quite imposing. Very well kept, beautifully build. What's most fascinating tough is it's history, the story of the popes who came from Rome to stay there, as they",
          "Really interesting guided tour all done with an ipad type thing. Really worth spending a few hours especially the time portal thing.",
          "We could only see the place from the outside since it was shut. However, the fa\u00e7ade and the areas around are impressive!",
          "You can see the grandeur of the palace from the sheer size of it. However, it Is difficult to imagine how it was when the popes actually lived there. The tour provides you with electronic tablets that show pictures of how the various rooms may have looked with furniture and",
          "The self guided tour, with cleaver iPad guide takes 1.5 to 2 hours. Lots of steps. Interesting, but not HC friendly.",
          "This middle age castle brings you back in the game of thronees age. Very well preserved, with even some rooms that havent changed nor been restored since the 13th century! Yet the experience you have with the ipad and virtual reality is like none other, you understand millions",
          "We spent 3 1/2 hours wondering through this amazing building. Your admission includes a histogram / audio guide. What is really cool is you point the pad at a wall and it shows you what it would have looked like back then. Lots of history and don\u2019t forget to play the treasure",
          "This is an interesting historic site. You receive an iPad when you enter that includes an audio tour and images showing the rooms at various times in history. The headsets for our iPads kept falling off which was frustrating, and the audio portion changed from English to French",
          "Firstly, there are a lot of stairs, secondly as the morning progresses it gets busy. The audio with special effects is very clever and hi-tech, the information boards in every room are in English. It\u2019s a bit like the Tardis, bigger on the inside. A must on any visitors list when",
          "Home to 7-8 popes in Roman times. Worth a self-guided tour although several great tour companies available. Check with your hotel or the tourist office on rue de Republic.",
          "My wife and I toured the palace and enjoyed the visit. The extent of the place was amazing. The audiobook tour was great, and the virtual reality effects were interesting. I would definitely recommend. The changes for the physically impaired were significant due to the many",
          "Excellent experience, ticket includes use of iPad style tablet with narrative and interactive map to fully explain the amazing palace history. Well worth a visit.",
          "With the half bridge a must visit in Avignon. Some quite daunting stairs but worth persevering. The audio coverage in the price of the ticket is hndy",
          "Impressive palace easy to spend a few hours in. Histopads may or may not be for you but if you have kids they keep them entertained while you are looking around. Good value at Euro15 per person including the histopad tour and bridge admission (save more with a family ticket).",
          "This building represents an important point in history and puts on display the incredible luxury and wealth that the Popes of that time enjoyed. Its layout and scale is impressive and it takes quite a bit of time to take it all in. We had a live guide but they also have iPads",
          "Really enjoyed our visit. Audio guide was helpful. The views are stunning. Get the ticket including a ticket to the bridge and save $. Fun to sit in cafe in plaza below and enjoy the view.",
          "The building is impressive and, even more impressive, is the history accompanying the building. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The scale of the ediface is staggering. Absolutely beautiful. Many museum-quality artifacts inside. One of the most important stops in the South of France. Underground parking is nearby and very convenient to the site.",
          "The Palais du Papesin Avignon is a huge stone building without a single interesting feature. The notepas guide, so lauded by other reviewers, is a nuisance. Don't waste your time.",

          "The \u2018Histopad\u2019 interactive tablet with headset makes this a fantastic experience. Not just an audio tour but a soundscape ( think Gregorian chants, the crackle of a fire...) and a 3D movable rendering of some of the rooms showing the furniture and even \u2018ghost\u2019 figures of the",
          "Amazing. Highly recommended. We stayed in Avignon only a 5 minute walk away, so we were able to walk there every day to take in the ambiance. The architecture is just incredible and we did the self tour inside the building. The surrounds are also incredible with the",
          "The extremely impressive exterior leads to a collection of completely empty rooms of various sizes.They have to be empty so coachloads of tourists whirling like slow motion dervishes staring at tablets do not fall over anything real.Looking at an artists impression on a computer",
          "The Palais des Papes is absolutely breathtaking. To imagine popes from hundreds of years ago living in the palace and working there is a lot to take in. They offer audio tours of the Palace so you can enjoy the history of each room at your own pace. This is truly a",
          "A large area where the Popes once lived surrounded by a walled city. The church is nice but not great, the area surrounding is very nice. I enjoyed the history.",
          "If visiting on your own do not be panicked by the groups surging forwards. take your time to fully understand and enjoy what there is to see. The frescoes in the chapels and private rooms are highlights. They provide you with an audio guide which is a tablet as well as head",
          "Must-do in Avignon. A bit pricey but you are given an interactive tablet and headset which is like your own private tour.",
          "So you get this ipad tour when you buy a ticket and when you enter each room you hover the ipad over a time transporter which converts the screen into a look at how each room would look back in the 14th century including people, tables, artwork fabrics etc. very insightful and",
          "This tour is by pre-programmed audio and visual guides on tablets. They were rather confusing at first but rather ingenious once we figured them out. The palace itself is 25 empty rooms with very little character and a lot of walking. Worthwhile for the historical and",
          "Interesting history of Papal residence in Avignon. Do the walking tour with the electronic guide- You\u2019ll get more out of the experience; our group did not and I feel we missed a lot.",
          "The Palais des Papes dominates the skyline of Avignon. The tour is well curated with informative displays of artifacts. There is an audio tour that includes a \u201chistopad\u201d that displays where you are on the tour and video of how the rooms looked when the Palais was in use in the",
          "What a fabulous building with a very very interesting history. Our brilliant guide Emmanuel acted out all the drama associated with it and brought it all to life. A wonderful building, a must to visit. We will go back for another trip to spend more time there.",
          "After visiting the brewery came to the Place of the Popes. The iPad commentary and visual reference was outstanding. To be able to see what the rooms looked like originally was fantastic. This is simply a must see while in Avignon.",
          "I cannot possibly guess how many historic sites, monuments, museums and historically significant churches and mosques I have visited in my life. Le Palais des Papes is without doubt one of my favorite! While the quality of the structure and its location are marvelous, it is",
          "This place can only come alive if you use the audioguide in each room to see and learn how things were at the time of the papacy. Otherwise there are just a lot of bare walls and nice views up on the towers.",
          "It\u2019s impressive & beautiful facade would almost be enough but this incredible piece of Franco-Roman history inside is the treasure of Avignon. They provided the best audio presentation I have ever used, with additional video features allowing you to view the rooms as they might",
          "The Mistral Winds were blowing the day we came here...watch out and hold on tight when you are on the top of the castle. Scary winds. Make sure you have the I-Pad to see what the interiors of the castle looked like. We exited a different spot from entering and then got lost",
          "This is an impressive hulk of a complex right in the middle of Avignon, and in fact, put Avignon on the map in the Middle Ages. The history is somewhat complex, so read up a bit before you go, relative to the schism in the church, antipopes, etc. It will give you a deeper",
          "This building has a lot of history, and on top of that is very beautiful. It's a must see in this region of France. When you visit make sure to avail yourself of their video guide. It's incredible! I wish I had hours and hours just to go through the whole interactive guide. It",
          "I visited also a few years ago but now I found out a great improvement: a sort of tablets on which you could figure out how the walls and the interiors used to look like at that period.",
          "The histopad guide was super impressive and gave us so much information about this interesting historical site. The way they made use of new technologies to introduce the old is amazing. A wonderful experience and worth every euro.",
          "You'll need to use some imagination to bring the building to life as there's not much left inside. Fortunately there's a nicely-done augmented reality guide on a tablet which shows you what the grander rooms may have looked liked in their prime. It's still worth doing the tour.",
          "The building is impressive and the audio guide outstanding. Only the two small chapels and the papal bedroom are seriously intact and that is disappointing for a fine monument.",
          "This is actually two buildings. Construction began in AD1252 with the first pope taking up residence in 1309. French popes used this as their seat for 70 years. Today the grounds are used for cultural and social events. When I visited they were preparing for a wine event. Many",
          "Highly recommend a visit, the augmented reality histopads added a great deal to our knowledge and experience on the tour. We visited on a Monday in late April and was very impressed with the number of visitors. Great experience.",
          "While there was interesting and rich history, In hindsight, I would have spent less time touring the palace and more time walking around Avignon. The town is delightful with plenty of shops and restaurants.",
          "A really good example of old meets new. The integration of using tablets and headsets to explore this magnificent building is brilliant. You explore the \u201cempty\u201d rooms but if you lift your tablet up you can see the room as it was when it was created. Fascinating and brilliant use",
          "In the beginning of the 14th century, Pope Clement V transferred Papal power from Rome to Avignon, making Avignon the capital of the Christian world for seven decades. It is rich in history and stood through rebellion and revolution. Yet, although it sustained damage, it was",
          "I wanted to visit the palace knowing that it was the place where the pope lived for some centuries. However, I hadn't done much research about it. I was so positively impressed by it. The size of it is huge and it's very impressive. The tablets with AR that they give are super",
          "This tour includes a self guided, hand-held devise that gave interesting info as you proceed through the ancient building. A very interesting feature was that when you held up the devise, a small screen would show what the rooms actually looked like at the time they were in use.",
          "Waited over an hour. Got close to the front but didn\u2019t move due to dozens cutting in line. No organization to get in. I left in disgust. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nice inside but not worth the frustration of the lineups.",
          "Did not know the history of this place. Worth a trip inside. The palace is in the old town. Take the virtual tour.",
          "The Palais des Papes is very impressive. There is an entrance fee to include the bridge. I believe we paid 45 euro for the family packet. Pick up the electronic Ipad. There is a scanner in each room that starts the history. As you move the Ipad around the room is shows",
          "Having bypassed Avignon on many occasions, we finally decided to visit it. The whole city far surpassed my expectations. Very beautiful, stunning architecture, amazing history. To walk out onto the Pont d'Avignon was magical. I cannot recommend this place enough.",
          "The residence of the Roman Catholic Papacy in the 1300's. Fascinating history and architecture. We spent a few hours inside, others may prefer shorter or longer visits, your personal preference. Entry fee includes also the Pont d' Avignon bridge not far away, which as I",
          "you'll get a tablet that shows you round, without this it'd be awful, all historic but a bit hard going.",
          "We started with a tour organised by Riviera cruises. The walk to the palace from the boat was short and slightly uphill. The tour involves steps and cobbles but it is a reasonable walk. The tour was fascinating with the history of the palace, the Avignon popes, and the area",
          "This is probably the most visited site in Avignon. My friend had already visited it in the past and so I went here to visit for a couple of hours. The price is quite expensive and the audio guide is included in the price.",
          "I knew some of the history behind the \u2018second Vatican\u2019 but was woefully ignorant about the whole story. This tour was really well done ... in fact I would say one of the best palace or church visits to date (and I have been on quite a few). The tablet you receive allows you to",
          "This was an excursion provided by our Riviera River Cruise. Our guide was excellent and made the history of the Palace really come alive. Best way to get the most out of this experience would be with a guide. I wouldn't recommend for anyone who has difficulty walking as there",
          "Full of historical artifacts and very interesting. Well worth a visit. You can choose to be guided by a headset controller or just taking the tour at your own pace reading the well positioned boards in English, German or Spanish as you go along",
          "If you do any sightseeing in Avignon then the one thing you should do is Palais des Papes. It sits proudly looking proudly across the walled city and the visit is well worth it to get a sense of the city and all its history.",
          "I read in a guidebook that this place was so cleaned out, why spend money to visit it? I disagree! The authority that runs the place has gone to great lengths to help guests imagine what it was like when the Popes were there. The tablet guide had reams of information and",
          "My wife and I took the tour using their iPad devices, which automatically provided explanations as you walked through the self-guided tour. This device provided a virtual reality window into how the palace looked in the time of the popes. Extremely well done and fascinating! The",
          "A wonderful visit to this magnificent, historical palace. The audio guides were superb! One was able to scan them in the center of each room and be able to see in 3D how these magnificent rooms looked decorated in their day!",
          "Enjoyed seeing this amazing building, an architectural feat. The iPads we were asked to carry around our necks were a disappointment as they craved so much attention that it took away from soaking in the history.",
          "The best way to get the most from your visit to the palace is a guided tour by a local tour guide. The most history will be learned from an excellent guide as opposed to self-guide.",
          "About a 10 /15 minute walk from the train station you'll come across the beautiful building of Palais des Papes. Quite interesting walking around looking through the different rooms and seeing the cripts. Well worth the visit. Maybe about 30 people here when we visited so was",
          "Allow a couple of hours to visit this stripped bare, medieval Papal Palace brought to life by an excellent audio-visual guide. You will learn a lot about the 14th century schism in the Catholic Church, and the politics and high finance of the French Popes. Avignon lost out to",
          "We must have been lucky to go there about 11am and not that many people there. The rain must have put them off. You get a tablet that guides you through the palace with audio in applicable language. There are portals in each chamber that you connect to that begins narration and",
          "we went twice. Very interesting and in-depth. They give you a tablet, very helpful to understanding what you are seeing.",
          "We toured with a Viking group tour and found the pace acceptable given the large number of steps to climb and descend. Our guide and the markers in each room told the story of the evolution of the buildings and grounds and there were many interesting architectural features to",
          "This is a fantastic place to take a couple of hours and visit. Not only is the structure itself fascinating and fun to explore, but the history and the amount of influence that this place had for a period of time makes the visit worth it.",
          "So glad that I took the time to go through the Palais des Papes. It is self guided with an I pad and was very easy to use. You can take as much time as you want, and definitely take the time to climb to the top, the view is spectacular.",
          "What some of you might not be aware of is that Avignon was the seat of the Pope from 1309 until 1378. Following some manipulation of the college of Cardinals, 7 elected Popes of the Catholic Church were French. They chose Avignon as the seat of power and built the Palais des",
          "Early morning is the best time to visit. The crowd is less and one can run through the place leisurely. The place is ruined a bit being so old and not kept up after the Pope left for Rome. But is large and the Vatican seems to be built in a similar style as the Avignon Palace.",
          "A really nice building and the idea with the video guide is great. Small negative point is, that I would wish to see more exhibits marked in English and more of the rooms of the palace.",
          "Even though it was only May the palais was quite busy but there was planty of room to wander and view the exhibits without tripping over people. Very interesting metal art sculptures at the start but I was really impressed with the nice room to room flow of the exhibits and the",
          "Four adults walked through the papal palace. Since no one in our group knew any of the history, it was very interesting. I really liked that the explanations of the exhibits were in a variety of languages. We didn't use the iPad for the tour because we wanted to use our own",
          "This is probably one of the best self-guided tours I have ever experienced. At the start you are given a tablet and a set of earphones in your language. The tablet knows where you are and displays what the various rooms looked like in the 1300s when Avignon was the seat of the",
          "We went to the Palais des Papes for a tour, and were there for around 2 hours. They gave you an Ipad which told you where to walk and what to do during the tour, with an audio function which informed you of the history of the place. It was really enjoyable actually and nice day",
          "As you walk through the Palais des Papes, you connect electronically to several stations using an iPad-esque \"histopad\". By then holding this tablet up, you are able to see an image of what the various rooms would have looked like with drapes and furniture. That part of the tour",
          "While on a one day stop in Avignon, we did a walking tour of the town, including a visit to the Palais des Papes. This is the largest medieval fortress and biggest Gothic palace in Europe, built in the 13th and 14th centuries by popes who left Rome for the safety of Avignon.",
          "Very long queue, and when we got to the entrance after 90min of waiting, there was something wrong with the ipads. We got a small discount, but I think you really need the technology to make the most of this experience.",
          "We based ourselves in Marseille and went around Provence in three full days. The fast train took us to Avignon\u2019s UNESCO 14th century palace in 40 minutes. We walked the many private apartments with frescoes depicting religious ceremonies, kings and patriarchs from the Bible",
          "We spent half a day visiting this ancient Popes\u2019 Palace, and it was not crowded due to the low travel season. Interactive guided on a Samsung tablet is very good. Lots of history surrounding this location. There\u2019s also a very pretty garden next to it that offers great view of",
          "Well worth the travel from Nimes, audio was very formative and because there were not that many people we got to have a great look around",
          "Excellent place to visit. Thoroughly enjoyable. Very interesting. Good value. Clever use of technology to provide information. You're given an iPad to walk you through the Palace.",
          "The Papal Palace in Avignon is an enormous landmark in the city. The sheer size is amazing. We went on a day on which there were apparently no tours, at least with an English-speaking guide. It was worth walking through the palace just to get a sense of the size and",
          "The sheer magnitude of this edifice is astonishing. The fact that the palace was built for the head of the church at this time of over 600 years ago is a testament to the devotion to the church and the control of the population back then. To think it contained a storage of",

          "we spent a good day here and were surprised how large the palace is, we were lucky as we found the multi floor carpark and it came up at side of the palace square, very handy. when you pay at the entrance you receive headphones and a i-pad and when walking around the palace",
          "This place is impressive and is well worth a visit, especially as the price for an attraction of this calibre is very reasonable. The digital guide (price included in the ticket) is a good way to guide visitors around the Palace and is nicely done with some excellent impressions",
          "We went on a very cold day & it is not heated, so dress according to the weather. That said it was a fascinating tour due to the interactive iPad/head sets that allow you to visualize how the palace looked when the Popes were in residence. It also showed me that the popes were",
          "We visited the south of France on June and Avignon city was the most remarkable for me and my husband. we took a tour of Palais des Papes and I would say it is worth a visit even though it is a bit expensive. A huge fortified cathedral with beautiful architecture and sculptures.",
          "I love Avignon and Palais des Papes. A really unique experience. A lot of tourists in June as to be expected. Expensive entry fee but worth a visit. History like this is amazing.",
          "I was totally in awe of this building and the age of it, still standing, it is just a majestic sight! The whole area is huge, I love how it is enclosed with a wall, although driving around is pretty tricky when you don't realise there are only a few ways to get places inside.",
          "What could have been a mundane traipse around an old building was changed into a very rewarding and interesting visit of this papal palace. Modern technology via an iPad lookalike allows visitors to see all around the inside of each of the rooms as they would have been used",
          "Great historic site that was the centre of Catholicism for just under a century. Very friendly guide/ ticket seller: he took an interest in us and our trip. Excellent technology to support and inform the traveller. You get a handheld iPad type device and it tracks where you go",
          "You can have an amazing history hour accompanied by an interactive tour guide. The place is very good organised with cafeteria and gift shop",

          "I visited once before on a warm day and much preferred that. In the winter, it can be cold walking through the museum and on the grounds outside, so bundle up. On the plus side, it was somewhat deserted when we visited. The iPad guides were helpful but not always easy to",

          "This church castle is beautiful from the outside, but cannot be accessed, unless you want to enter a small chapel in the side. Still, it is a must see if visiting Avignon.",
          "Knew the history before I arrived and it was as expected. Wonderful architecture and our guide made all the difference in our visit. We were there right after the tourist season, so virtually had the place to ourselves on a misty day. Did not spend much time inside as off",

          "This Palace of the Pope's I think is a \"must see\" when visiting Avignon. There's so much history involved in the building, it's also in great shape and you can go as fast or slow as you like. They have interactive tablets available in many languages, these tablets you can scan",
          "The palais is very grand and make good use of technology. Through the tablet guide on hand, visitor can view the past glory of each location, showing how it would have looked in the 14th century, as well as information on its uses. We had wanted to just take some photos of",
          "This is an example of how the Church used to rule in Europe. This Palace, housing maybe 200 servants and a single sovereign pontiff, takes up a looot of space. It is the largest Gothic style building in the world, and the Park surrounding it used to be fenced off to keep the",
          "We took the day-trip from Marseilles to Avignon, as the history of the French Papal Residences intrigued us. Sadly, the building has been gutted over the years, so is basically the shell of what it was, and not a lot of money sunk into it to represent its splendor back in the",
          "As luck would have it, it started to rained as soon as we walked into palais des papes. While it rained outside, we enjoyed the virtual tour of what once was a pretty decadent palace. Worth the visit- buy the package ticket that includes pont d\u2019Avignon.",
          "The price of entry is quite reasonable. The audioguide is actually a tablet. It tracks your movement throughout the palace and can play the tracks automatically. You can scan the \"time portals\" then look through the tablet screen to see a recreation of what the room looked like",

          "I had reservations about whether to tour inside as I was told that the rooms are quite bare. However, to my surprise, they've used the best of technology to bring the place alive. You get a personal I Pad and earphones. As you walk around and hear the explanations, you place the",
          "I went with my family to the Pope Palace in Avignon last summer and I was stunned ! It's amazing how after all these years, it's still beautiful and it's really impressive. The walls are huge and the seillings are painted with beautiful designs on them. I learned a lot of things",
          "A must when you visit France. It\u2019s just a 2 hour in train away from Paris and it\u2019s an amazing piece of architecture, with an awesome view. It\u2019s a little complicated to get to the Palais des Papes from the TGV station but it is worth it. It\u2019s better to buy your tickets online,",

          "Kids are 8 and 5 years old. Enjoyed the visit at the bridge. Followed by lunch at Chez Lulu (recommended by locals) then went on a train ride around Avignon followed by the Palais Des Papes. It was an awesome day. Timing perfect as we ended the visit in time for the sunset on",

          "So this is the first time I have had an interactive iPad to help guide me around the Palais. And it was very effective. Really helped bring the history to life. The commentary and the images were really well put together. Highly recommended. Just watch the opening hours as the",
          "I went to the palais de pap expecting it to be very boring but with the histoplasma you get on arrival the whole experience is improved. Except one iPad they all worked perfectly and the reason it is not 5 stars is that at 18:30 the staff started shutting down when the place",

          "The apparently new iPad guide which you receive upon admission allows you to view each room through virtual reality programming as it might have been back when the palace was used by popes. Amazing!",
          "Have wanted to visit for years and it didn't disappoint. The audio guide was fantastic (a tablet which showed rooms as they were in the past and had a treasure hunt that kept my 6 year old entertained) & really enhanced the visit.",

          "Close to centre of town. Many activities occurred in square in front of Palais Interesting structure",

          "First of all, the Histopad that is provided might just well be the best tool I've ever experienced. Instead of just an audio-guide, this tablet allows you to see, in real-time 3D video, what the rooms looked like centuries ago with all their adornments and furniture. It may",
          "Lovely day at Palace of the Pope, no large crowds . The audio is a little confusing . Probably best to have a guide",

          "We spent a very pleasant afternoon exploring the Palais des Papes. The building is beautiful and expansive but the best thing about the tour is the tablets that help you experience the palace along the way. The tablets provide you with an audio guide, as you would expect, but",

          "The iPad audio visual self guided tour is the best I have ever seen. Its interactive, has optional parts you can view, and even has a game. Sadly my ipad or game was broken and I could not complete that portion, but the game is more geared towards those under 12 years of age.",
          "Fascinating spot to visit,it was the home to 7 Popes in Avignon,while,for about 100 yrs,another Pope ruled in Rome! Well worth a visit and you can get a ticket for the Palace and 'The Bridge'",

          "I loved the little pad they give you for the tour. It shows images of what it must have looked like in the 1300's. I also loved the mapping portion so you could see where you are and what rooms you've finished. Only disappointment was that we missed the Christian LaCroix",

          "Four of us spent a month in France. Avignon was a particularly nice stop. The Palais des Papes was different from any other palace because religiously oriented. During something more than 100 years, A series of Popes lived here. The palace is well preserved and the audio tour is",
          "I would assume that to visit Avignon requires a visit to the Palais fed Papes. It is probably the reason Avignon is so famous. The Palace is well preserved and the entry price comes with an audio tour. A lot of effort has gone into making the audio tour interesting for both",
          "We were excited to tour this Palace. We received the audio guide and the iPad which had the walking path and in each room you would center over a symbol and it would come alive with the way the rooms looked in the past. There was also a way to collect Gold coins in each room",

          "This was a very interesting site. The Palace has seen better days but enough remains to make a visit worthwhile. The audio-visual tour is well worth it and makes the Palace come alive. Nice small closet of curiosities at the end.",

          "I have seen many medieval castles on many different countries, and to some extent they all resemble each other. The popes palace has one special attraction, and that is the very modern presentation. You really should get the \"audio guide\" tour, which is not only an audio guide,",

          "The building itself ist very beautiful and wirth it to visit. But the audioguide is really bad. It is to technically and everybody is just looking through the tablet. It should show you the rooms in the past, but just looks like a comic. You also can play a game with it to find a treasure.",

          "The interactive tablet used for the tour is an excellent idea. Very informative",
          "The museum was great. I am surprised on how much they managed to do whit the little they were left with for the restauration. The guide is amazingly well done. Good job, fellow programmers! And the information audio guide tells you just enough to experience the way of life in the palace at the time.",
          "Interesting as a building but there are only limited internal displays. I'd make do with the facade and save the entrance fee for a few coffees.",
          "I would have loved to have visited and scored it higher but sadly the queues were far to long and to slow, especially as you are queuing in the heat. The area around is beautiful and the mini tour train worth doing.\n\nIf you want to get into \u2026",

          "Wonderful museum. It was the best museum I have been to, because of the virtual reality software and audio guide.",
          "I was very interested as the pope had stayed in this castle. It s nice but watching n hearing via head phones n ioads was a munroe cumbersome added to scanning the coins in each room to hear the audio. Also our required half s day solely for the castle",

          "Definitely worth a visit.",

          "Impressive, but the town was quite depressing and empty in the late summer.",

          "Suitable for all age as the treasure hunting game attracts the interest of the kids!",
          "A beautiful landmark to tour. The AR experience provided with easy to carry tablets makes it easy to imagine how the palace may have felt when it was inhabited and filled with dining guests. The stairs may be difficult for less mobile \u2026",

          "Well worth the tour - the histopads take you back in time!",
          "An absolute must see if you're into history. At first, the tablet thing felt gimmicky but it's actually a really nice tool to better understand where you are. I didn't use the earphones but the \"time portals\" were really nice",

          "Great audio/video tour. Allows you to visualize what rooms may have looked like in 14th century.",
          "It is probably The attraction from around and the place is upgraded with the audio tour, but it boring, little to see, audio tour treasure hunt couldn't be finish as room was closed, put at least the hunt game before the closed room to continue, for the rest impressive building that you can see from the outside.",
          "We didn't go in the Palais, but we did walk around for a while. Incredible views if you make the trek to the top.",
          "A really interesting place. The included Augmented Reality portable tablets and headphones worked well for both adults and children.",

          "Experience the history of a papal state, the papacy itself and the French connection. The absolute luxury of the papacy gives one pause when one considers the representative of Christ on Earth versus the humble carpenter from Bethlehem.",

          "Lovely historical pile",
          "Overall a bit disappointing.  Feels empty, lacks furniture and furnishings. The tablet virtual imaging helps, but it would be much better with real objects inhabiting the rooms.",

          "Great tour, the histopad makes it a very enjoyable experience for adults and children",
          "The house of the pope in the 14th century, it was a brilliant and well restored site which contained the history of the papel chambers before the move to Vatican city. The audio tour was also a nice way of explaining the important places to visit in the palais.",
          "The Palais is a great monument to explore; it is made more exciting by the technology deployed to bring each room to life before the eyes of tourists. It is is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Fantastic place: innovative interactive tablet programme with real-time images that recreate the original decor wherever you are looking at the time. \u20ac12 per adult includes the interactive tour  (and a treasure hunt game for kids).

          "The building is excellent made and to see how the Papst lived in.",
          "Fascinating site to visit in most major languages with a tablet provided and interactive guide throughout. If you go to Avignon without visiting the Papal Palace and the Saint Benezet bridge, it iskust as good as you have not been to Avignon at all.",
          "This was a fantastic experience! I loved the Histopad provided that used augmented reality to show what the inside looked like in the 1300s! Hands down the best history guided walkthrough I've ever been on!",

          "Worth a visit. Enjoy the panoramic views from the upper gardens, then enrich  yourself with a tour of the historic Palais des Papes.",
          "Spectacular and informative. Don't forget to pick up the enhanced reality tablet that shows you what the palace originally looked like as you walk around. And it turns out that you can't walk through a wall just because it wasn't there 600 years ago. It's also worth taking a first aid kit.",

          "Famous Popes headquarter!! Impressive to visit, with \u20ac14,50 you'll receive ticket, earphone and tablet to follow the path and interact with it. Consider to spend about 3h inside because the palace is really huge and you need to listen the \u2026",

          "FANTASTIC PLACE. REALLY INTERESTING AND WELL SHOWN. I LOVE AN IDEA OF HISTORYTAB - THE SMALL TABLET OFFERED TO ANY ONE WHU BOUGHT THE TICKET. USING THIS DEVICE U WILL DISCOVER UNUSUAL THINGS. \nTICKETS FOR SENIORS AVAILABLE. \nTIME NEEDED: AT LEAST 2,5 - 3 HOURS. GOOD FOR SMALL KIDS",
          "This is a stupendous rambling palace in the heart of Avignon housing art masterpieces but a lot of walking is involved and many steps as well. It overlooks a beautiful square where there is a little train that carries up to the top of Avignon for glorious views of the river Rh\u00f4ne and pont Di avignon",

It does get hot in the summer so a fan might be helpful.",
          "Plenty of big neglected rooms. A big disappointment eventhough entrance was free of charge.",

          "Awesome views, went wine tasting in the cellar.",
          "The high-tech computer tablet added an extra dimension, with 360 degree views of how the palace looked - neat. Other than that,  a rather dull visit, unless you are a history junkie.",
          "Very educational and interesting. We stopped here during a cruise ship stop. We did an excursion through the shop and really enjoyed having the private guide. Would recommend for anyone having a cruise ship stop that offers an excursion to this location.",

          "Unfortunately you get a better experience of the tour if you can read the french signs. Still a very interesting and impressive place to visit, also thanks to the tablet provided. Count 2 to 3 hours to fully enjoy",
          "So my ratimg is not about the palais itself but rather on the 'skip the line' line. After obtaining tickets online we waited for over an hour whilst the line for regulars moved! Do not buy tickets online!",
          "The histopad (tablet with AR) is amazing. As you tour the palace, you scan the QR code which will allow you to see and interact with the room in the 14th century. There's also indoor positioning system so the tablet knows which room you're \u2026",
          "It was a great tour. I'm bad at world history, so I've always thought that center of catholic church has always been in Vatican. So, lessons are learned well when I visited this palace. \n\nThe palace tour can be helped by audiovisual guide \u2026",
          "Probably a must see if in Avignon however it is not the most interesting place in the area and it is quite pricey for what it offers. Augmented reality tablets took away from the experience for me as I found myself staring at a screen rather than at the architecture itself.",
          "This building proves to me that Pope's feel they are royalist. The audio states how a woman accused of murdering her husband all property seized till she met the Pope and he purchased the town for 800 gold coins from her after blessing her. \u2026",

          "beautiful place to visit. Parking was a little bit tricky to find at first. but once you came up you are directly at the site. Very convenient if you are not planning a long day there. I tried the public street parking nearby but way too many people. I would say save your time just park underneath the Palais. It wasn't too expensive.",
          "a beautiful scenery of the whole city! worth the visit!",
          "Take excursion with histopad, won't regret!",
          "Great place to visit, the staff was friendly and the palace was very interesting. The free audio video tour with the tablets was amazing. Whenever you scan the logo in the designated rooms you could look around and have a look in the room \u2026",
          "The museum was amazing. They have an interactive tour guide, that really takes you to the time the pope resinged in Avignon, if you are in the area, do visit! 1,5h minimum",
          "Very Nice, lovely place, they have student discount.",
          "Wow, what a well presented and preserved piece of history. \nTake the tour through the palace and take in the buildings and the historical facts that go with them.",

          "The interactive audio tablet was fantastic",
          "A lot of really great information in different formats. Written, tablet, and audio. I recommend going in the morning. It was very warm around 11:30 am when we went. The night lights show is a must see if you are here after dark.",
          "It\u2019s great historical place to learn. It is quite well maintained inside with great facilities. \nBut I think the tablet device can be distraction. \nI would be great if people can choose from simply audio on small device. probably the bigger \u2026",
          "Enormous!  Histiopads brought the past to life.",
          "Opulent lifestyle and taste when the Popes were the leaders of Christendom. I could not have imagined if I did not see it with my own eyes. Palace itself was astounding. Such architecture does not exist anymore, unfortunately. Loved it.",
          "Beautiful!! Loved every minute",
          "A grand historical attraction which should be seen by all in the area.",
          "Historically significant place for sure! There are histopads that help you interact with the rooms, showing them as they would have looked when the Popes lived there. The rooms are quite spare otherwise, so this made the visit more interesting. Would be neat if they had preserved some of the gardens in the courtyards.",
          "Amazing historical palace in Avignon. Must see it!",
          "Lovely quaint little area. The Papal Palace is what you encounter after a series of souvenir shops. The cobblestone streets then lead you into a square with lots of restaurants and then on a street with shops. Lots of eating and dining \u2026",
          "I've always been a big history fan and this Palais was the witness and stage of major historical changes.",
          "Interesting history.  Great visual aids.",

          "Massive mideival complex. Although it is empty, the audio guides and tablets digitally restores the rooms to their original grandeur.",
          "Nice to see in july during theatre festival",
          "The iPad virtual tour of each rooms they were is a spectacular use of technology to enhance your experience. Virtual treasure hunt for kids is a added bonus. Highly recommend!",
          "Very interesting, beautiful view",
          "Calm and scenery religional place",
          "Not sure how I walk right by the self-guided iPad devices, but somehow they escaped me.   It occurred to me about 5 minutes into the tour that everyone had one but me. Lol. Just a heads up for other distracted folk like me.  That said, I still enjoyed the place, although I wasn't entirely sure what I was looking at all the time.",
          "Best interpretation ever seen. Modern, with a lot of interaction what is possible only with tablets. Special quest game for children and adults make it even more unique. Take ebough time for visit.",
          "Nice palace turned to a museum now. Best part is the audio cum video guide which will turn some room in the palace to look like as it was in the old. Loved this place. The terrace view of Avignon is marvelous.",
          "Very cool castle with deep history!",
          "Excellent place to visit the histopad brings it to life",

          "Beautiful gothic castle with rich history overlooking the walled inner city of Avignon",
          "Beautiful and fill of history... The AR tour is definitely worth it.",
          "Interesting history of the French Vatican. I don't usually like wearing the personal headphone narration devices so I didn't pick one up. But this one is different because it shows pictures of the rooms as they were decorated and furnished. \u2026",
          "The \"HistOpad\" made this experience one of a kind with a virtual guided tour given you the ability to travel \"back in time\" a must see",
          "Worth the entrance fee just for the e-guide alone. Kudos to those who developed it. It was interactive & informative. I like the fact they showed us what it could've looked like.",
          "I could almost hear the angels singing, beautiful visit.",
          "Amazing to see.  Say yes to the free headset and tablet tour guide.  Very helpful and gives you images of the rooms as they were.",
          "Impressive and informative. A piece of Western history that shaped future centuries for all humankind.",
          "Amazing ancient architecture in ancient, preserved walled city.  Good multi-language personal guide to each historical room.  Many old artifacts on display in huge chapel.  Definitely worth the time and cost.",
          "Fascinating to hear the history of two popes at same time. Much military destruction of the Palais when they left.",
          "It is a place where there are amazing views and the visual guide of a tablet is very interactive and a very interesting idea.",
          "Very interesting history of the Avignon Popes.",
          "Amazing tour with very informative interactive guide tablets.",
          "Even though the palace has been empty for several years its history is well presented with pads with virtual images and stories as you enter the different rooms. With this pad you can enjoy the tour at your own speed.",
          "A very interesting piece of history! Worth a visit! The audioguide is an interactive pad from Huawei which uses Augmented Reality to render the halls as they might have been in the 14th Century. Check the kitchen!",
          "An important slice of history.   Interactive tablet was the best device i used during 3 weeks in France.  A must see!!!",
          "Walk where popes walked, ate, planned and played. Their legacy is in the beautiful little town that grew up around the palace. Many of the great things of France - lavender, pastries, clothing, art, food, etc - are here to enjoy.",
          "Very interesting building.",
          "The open space and grandeur",
          "Amazed by the way this museum is organized. super tech savvy!! it transports you to the middle age which is awesome. A cultural must!",
          "Nice place.",
          "Impressive historic site. Well worth a visit. Especially out of the main tourist season (no queues).",
          "The digital experience visit is pretty good. Dont rush it, you need 4 hours to visit everything and there are so many details to check out.",
          "I think it's so interesting how the space has been converted not only into a museum for the history of the Catholic schism, but a showcase for modern art as well. Definitely a must see when in the region!",
          "Magestic and awesome. The wealth of the Catholic church in 1300 was clearly beyond belief. The tablet guide was very good but one of the party had problems with it ( very low volume) that detracted from their enjoyment. Worth a visit.",
          "Not exactly super original but still an \"incontournable\"! And the city around has so many hidden gems...",
          "Enormous and fascinating. Well laid out displays and good room information. Allow a couple of hours and be prepared for some walking and stair climbing - but well worth the effort.",
          "Great venue. Great show",
          "Interactive, self guided tour was very well done and engaging for all ages. It helped provide context for how the site has changed over the years and the role of the Popes in that era.",
          "An extremely interesting tour. The audio visual headsets added a great amount of information. Lots of steps.",
          "It was fantastic to visit the building. It takes 2 hours, but it worth it. You get a tablet which guides You and shows You all the parts of the building. Amasing.",
          "the Pope wasnt even there",
          "Beautiful landmark.",
          "Well maintained but no original furniture or carpets... only virtual but worth to visit",
          "Very  well organised  would  recommend  to anyone. \nTanya.",
          "Highly recommendable, take the histopad, it gives a good impression of the past splendour of the palace. It also offers a lot of additional info. Pay euro 2,50 more and you can also see the famous bridge. If you come by car, take the free \u2026",
          "A simply stunning place, definitely the main landmark of Avignon. It looks different at different times of the day but is always imposing. Do go inside, you won't be disappointed.",
          "Interesting use of technology to enhance the visit, but not always intuitive to use.  Very little ventilation so on hot days , it is oppressively hot.  Don't expect the grandeur of the Vatican.  Lots of imagination per use the technology to get a better sense.",
          "Fabulous. Large open square. Lots of cafes. Tourist train . Museum. Walk to the top to see park and views across the river and famous bridge. Excellent for sitting and watching",
          "Not that this place needs any more reviews, but we were impressed with the use of technology to help this building come alive. If the only augmented reality you have ever experienced is Pok\u00e9mon Go, then you are in for a real treat! Someone \u2026",
          "If you only have time to visit one thing in Avignon then I suggest that you make it this one. Not at all expensive and you are provided with a tablet pc with headphones that you will find so useful during your visit. The tablet becomes your \u2026",
          "It's a magnificent example of Middle Ages architecture and a great history lesson.  The palace, together with the medieval walls of the city, dominate the landscape from all around.  However, the interior of the building is pretty much \u2026",
          "It is very nice, but now there are also a lot of reconstructions .",
          "Iconic place !",
          "Really enjoyed the ipad tour. The virtual experience added so much to the visit. The content was informative and the rendition of the room help increase the understanding and appreciation of the palace. Great way to bring history to life.",
          "Awesome, as one could guess !",
          "It's a good walk back in time of when popes lived in Avignon. the guided visit with the \"histopads\" is well done and intuitive. Fun for solo and family travel.",
          "Very high price (12 euros) for a person. Park is free and quite good, but toilets are terrible",
          "One of the best augmented reality I have ever seen... it\u2019s amazing walking in that structure and having a view how the interior looked like hundreds of years ago.",
          "The augmented reality tablets are well done and immersive.\nIt was ridiculously hot though, because no windows were open and the whole thing heated up like an oven.\nThere is a coin hunt on the tablets for kids.\n2 criticisms- coin hunt should \u2026",
          "A place worth an holiday. Stunning palaces and architecture all around",
          "stunning to see, don\u2019t miss it. The sheer opulence of how the catholic church conducted itself is on display and worth seeing for all. the VR tour seemed like a gimmick at first, but it is actually a nice touch to give you a feel of the palace in its prime.",
          "Great! Not cheap, but the 'histopad' guide makes for an interesting an fun experience",
          "Great tablet based tour! Great for kids too with embedded treasure hunt. Buy tickets in advance online to bypass line.",
          "Fantastic light show at night",
          "I love the Palais des Papes. Views of the city and of the river unparalleled. Wonderfully maintained, with a rich history. Nice little gift shop inside the church. I visit the palais every time I'm in Avignon.",
          "The tour is not worth it: a bunch of empty rooms and a few recovered artifacts.",
          "This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that this is a wonderful historical site. What might come as a surprise is the use of technology. The included AR experience provides a great window into the palace as it was lived.",
          "Wonder full palace",
          "Honest opinion: the place is definitely worth visiting outside, the building is majestic! Going inside? Not worth a single penny, in my opinion. You get given a nice tablet audio guide, which has an indeed amazing software that guides you \u2026",
          "Really remind me of Attack of Titan when seeing the gorgeous barbican and wall.Videoguide is also awesome.",
          "Lovely place. Extremely comprehensive for non-French speakers. Even though the descriptions of the works are in French, a numerous number of the exhibits have multiple boards you can pick up of the descriptions in English, Italian, German, \u2026",
          "Excellent historical monument. Thanks.",
          "Admission is 12 Eur (+ optional 2EUR for the bridge), you get a laptop with an audio guide and 3D projections. Worth visiting!",
          "Memorable and so special.   Avignon loved it.",
          "Full of history and views. Worth of revisiting but not in summer time.",
          "Didn't quite know what to expect. But this is one of those visits you will remember for a long time.  Very well presented by the organization. You'll need a couple of hours to tour this place. Staff are very resourceful and helpful. \nA return visit for sure. Thank you Avignon!",
          "Stunning views, majestic building, great guided AR tour.",
          "Large unadorned rooms without much explanation. Historical presentation lacking. Read up before visiting.",
          "The tablet guide with AR mappings of the rooms is amazing! Really makes the place come alive. Every castle should do this.",
          "Great place, so much to see.",
          "Absolutely awesome and their tablet guide is fantastic",
          "Loved the histopad to recreate the old-time scenery!",
          "Nice walk around the Pope's former residence. They tried hard to make it flashy with virtual reality and tablets, and despite my sceptisism it does work. There are some impressive murals and architecture.",
          "The tablet guide was a great invention!",
          "Hugely significant location in both the history of France and the Catholic church, the palace has extensive buildings and a collection of artefacts and displays that offer appeal to all ages.",
          "Very interesting audio video guide",
          "Great place for tourists and for taking photos.",
          "Outstanding technology to take you back to medieval period.  Know that the tour includes many stairs and uneven walkways and cobblestones of the Middle Ages.",
          "Absolutely worth the visit even though quite pricey (50\u20ac for a family). The multimedia tablets are very informative and the AR applications give an idea how the rooms looked like 700yrs ago. At the same time it\u2019s a bit distracting so that at times you are so busy with the treasure hunt that you forget the real environment...",
          "The tour is enhanced with the tablets that useQR Codes to get information about the areas is the Palace.  A lot of history.",
          "very nice interactive visit with augmented reality technology",
          "After the visit ,to the palace just rownd the corner is some very nice restaurants",
          "Nice palace to visit. It\u2019s rather well preserved and has some interesting information. If you go up the towers and walls you can get some nice views of the area. The Pont d\u2019avignon is also near by and worth checking out.",
          "Interesting history.",
          "Amazing media experience inside.  Highly recommend",
          "A huge, grand, incredible papal Palace. A fascinating place to visit. Numerous rooms are open to the public, including grand meeting rooms, and small but elaborately painted chapels (viewable from the doorway). A truly fantastic place to visit",
          "Fabulous site to visit. Didn't think I would want to emerse myself in the technological guide, but using it really enhanced my visit. However, I loved the wall paintings, which unfortunately you couldn't take photographs of - even without flash on camera.",
          "The Histopad is great! You get to see what some rooms used to look like. Interesting and educational, so great for kids too.",
          "One of the most interesting and kid friendly historical places i have ever been to. The interactive tablets are excellent.",
          "They have a self guided tour using tablet devices now that recognizes your location and shows you the room as it may have existed during the time being discussed. Really a neat thing and made the history come alive.",
          "I am not mad about historical sites but this one I was keen to see. No regards. Knowing that it used to be pop\u2019s residence it cannot be compared to Vatican. Great castel, unfortunately it gets renovated which spoils the scenery. I would definitely recommend to visit.\nLeave your car outside of the old city, 20 minutes enjoyable walk.",
          "Exciting and very unexpected visit to the place due to the innovative history through modern IT technology of pseudo-virtualisation. Immerse yourself into the time of pope's time in medieval Avignon. Would certainly recommend and come back again for more treasure hunt.",
          "Great guided tour",
          "Interesting place with very useful history pads",

          "One of the best museum, i've ever visited",
          "Old castle with a cool visual/audio guide.  Castle has minimal furnishings but a tablet/audio guide bring the Castle to life with interactive imagery.",
          "I somehow expected more of the palace itself.  It's been turned into a sort of space for modern art.  However,  there is a rich history behind the place that is very interesting. I recommend getting the audio guides or at least reading all the placards.\n\nThere is a 7 minute movie on the first floor.   Don't miss it!",
          "Beautiful Castell, with the surrounding walls protecting the village.",
          "Interesting history and structure",
          "Very well preserved medieval castle, at least when it comes to the exterior. Inside, there is not much left of the original decoration, but you can use the tablet they give you at the entrance to see the reconstruction.",
          "Beautiful",
          "It was great example of the wealth of the church and the power of the  Pope.",
          "A must see when in Avignon.",

          "Inside the walled city of Avignon , France",
          "This is the Papal palace of popes when several of them were French. It is the main part of Avignon France. It is found inside a walled city and you could get lost for hours or days checking out the palaces and surrounding shops. Check \u2026",
          "You can't not love the Palais des Papes of Avignon. Great experience, first all ages and in all languages. I recommend it, well worth its price.",
          "Beautiful ancient building with a fascinating background story. The entrance fee is rather high but is well worth it because you get an awesome audio-/video guide. The guide is one of the best I've ever seen. It can actually revive the past!!",
          "Must have in Avignon. Impressive.",
          "An interesting place to visit.  A week planned itinerary guides you round the palace with plenty of interactive experiences.  Make sure you pick up the tablet guide.",
          "Definitely take advantage of the tablet guide they provide. My kids really liked the treasure hunt game. There's virtual coins that you need to find in the major rooms.",

          "Extremely interesting and the artificial intelligence on the electronic guides were brilliant",
          "I didn't do the tout as I was right for time but the building is amazing and well worth seeing. Beautiful surroundings in the square outside also with lots of restaurants and life about the place.",
          "Extensive palaces, complimented by some GPS tablet technology enabling you to examine rooms as they were in the past, just by pointing towards the walls.  Further depth of information by pressing Query symbols and games for the children. \u2026",
          "Only one word to describe: IMPRESSIVE... MUST SEE. Breath taking view from the gardens.",
          "It is a great castle!",
          "Astonishing relic of mediaval history. It was built in 14th century. Very impressed by it. It was the seat of pope for at least a century. The interactive AR based guide is the best I had ever seen in any place. A must visit in France.",
          "One of the most beautiful and splendid gothical palaces in Europe. Great museum for family with teenagers.",
          "Fascinating historic building, surprisingly easy to get around",
          "You must use the audio guide. It's phenomenal!",

          "Great 3D tech in the museum!",
          "Well worth a visit .",
          "It was under construction when we came. The weather was super hot (around 38 degree) and it was quite stuffy inside. The AR experience was quite cool with little treasure hunt games",
          "Totally enjoyed this trip into this region's historical past, the views are stunning and locals very welcoming. Lovely",
          "Amazing experience and thorough knowledge of historical events. If you love history I recommend a visit to avignon and have a tour. Hard to explain but it's worth the money we spent for entry fee.",
          "A lot of history. Great architecture",
          "At the time of my visit they were doing some restoration on the outside but it was still spectacular and the experience was very good. Mobile technology that makes the journey interactive was part of the entry fee. And what may have been a dull museum tour became a bit of a treasure hunt.",

          "Nice place to go on a vacation.",

          "Good audio guide which would be better if you could  \nZoom in on the details of the ceilings. Without the guide it's an empty she'll but the admission charge reflects that.",
          "Definitely worth a visit if in Avignon",
          "Very good place to visit if you like the history with technology you can see hows the place looks like before. Its bring you back to in the year of 1300. Take a morning visit so the rest of the day you can visit others. The ticket plus pond d\u2019avignon is \u20ac14.5.",

          "Nice place to visit, good idea with the HistoPad",
          "Having learned about this in books, I was enthralled to actually visit the Palais des Papes ! I've seen the Vatican a few times, but now I've seen the other Papal residence and well ~",
          "Very interesting history but there is a surprising lack of information as you walk through the rooms. Tablets are handed out with info, so everyone is walking around with electronics. It\u2019s neat, but there should be analog as well.",
          "They have used new technology very well to make the experience more enjoyable educational and interesting.\nFor example one can see and hear what things might have been like during the occupation by the popes.",
          "Nice historical place",
          "Good historical material on the Avignon papacy,  and medieval church and secular government.   Also a good look at how history effected the buildings and their restoration.  Not really for kids under 6.",

          "Great Chef.",
          "A very lovely place. I love the whole building architecture and we had a great time walking around every corner inside. Too bad it's only open until 7 pm so when I visited the place I came quite late so I didn't have much time to explore \u2026",
          "Worth a visit. The mixed reality aspect of the \"audio guide\" kept my younger kids interested as they searched for hidden coins in each room and being able to see what the rooms would have looked like via the Android tablet was novel.",
          "Top",
          "Amazing palace, where you can feel like in medieval ages!",
          "Excellent use of digital to enhance the experience of what would have been a largely empty building. Well worth a couple of hours.",
          "Really worth visiting this impressive building. We were also very lucky as there was exhibition of African art. Very well organised and succinct description of each room. Staff very helpful",
          "Wonderful place. great ancient buildings. I loved this place",

          "I grew up with the song, being from Canada, and was very surprised to meet some people from the US and Australia who had never hear of the song. We learned that the Canadian connection came from the Quebec-France connection, which we didn't realize. So, I was keen to sing the",
          "The bridge, better known as Le Pont d' Avignon, is apparently best known from a famous children\"s song - I am none the wiser however! The bridge was completed in 1185, creating the only place to cross the Rh\u00f4ne between Lyon and the Mediterranean sea. The bridge originally",
          "However we knew it didn\u2019t. Very pretty area and a nice walk. There are some interesting little places to explore.",
          "You have to visit this one. Not because of the famous song, but also stunning views, and nice architecture of the bridge as well.",
          "Liked reading the history, to be brutally honest don't know what I expected. The gardens from which we viewed the bridge are lovely. Glad we visited Avignon but glad it was just for a day.",
          "This bridge brings back childhood memories for so many people. My partner did the folk song while dancing on the bridge and he was joined in by another tourist. It is a remarkable bridge with So much history. The views are truly amazing.",
          "The bridge is famous. It is cheap to visit. You get a nice view of the river and papal palace. The surface is even to walk on. You are contributing to the upkeep of the bridge.",
          "Our tour bus disembarked near the Pont with the advisory, \u201cif you get lost, just follow the signs for the bridge.\u201d Of course the Pont is inextricably Linked to the history of Avignon. It was first constructed in the 12th Century, and has been destroyed and rebuilt several times",
          "Yes it is a Medieval Bridge, but it was destroyed and never rebuilt. There is folk song about the bridge, which makes it famous. Take a look from the river bank and move on.",
          "I would combine this visit with ine of the half day tours offered at Avignon Tourist centre. Provence tours was excellent with knowledgable guides and they speak English and French. You can walk the middle of the aquaduct and see the Rhone river below.",
          "Headset provided. Interesting history, definitely worth a visit if in Avignon. Nice walk from the centre of the city too.",
          "We arrived the previous evening on Riviera's MS William Shakespeare and moored just by Pont St Benezet - that is \u201csur le pont Avignon\u201d to you and me... A visit to the bridge was followed by a short walk to the town walls and it was only after viewing the flood gates do you",
          "I got a little lost trying to find the entrance while strolling through the narrow back streets of Avignon. After buying your ticket, you climb a long stairway to reach the tower and bridge level. It was a warm day just around 6pm and the sun still shone over the river, Avignon,",
          "What is going on in France...on my way to Avignon by Car i stop at Champs sur Yonne and in the Evening strolled by the river and YES come to the bridge that joins Champ to La Cour... ....except it doesn't ! it stops halfway in the middle of the River I eventually arrive in",
          "So we sang the song as we crossed the bridge awed by its beauty a d that of the Rhone River below. Passing over the middle of the we came to a barrier. It stopped. We couldn't cross over to the island. How can it be a bridge if it doesn't connect to anything? It 's better to",
          "Inluded in the ticket for the palais, is the entrance to the famous Pont d'Avignon. Honestly the view is best from the opposite bank of the Rhone, but of course you also want to stand on this famous half-bridge.",
          "It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s famous and it gaves a nice view . But that\u2019s it . After so many years singing \u201c Sur le pont ...\u201d I was expecting maybe to much ?",
          "Folk music aside this bridge has some decent architectural elements that can be admired very well from exterior. Not sure is worth the admission fee.",
          "Founded by the Greeks, then a Roman colony, Avignon's next period of history was one of successive invasions until more stable government arrived in the 9th century. A wooden bridge spanning the Rhone was built between 1177 and 1185, only to be destroyed 40 years later.",
          "Maybe you know the song of the people \"on the Avignon Bridge\". The bridge at issue is the San Benza Bridge, a very well-known bridge in Avignon, built during the Middle Ages between 1177 and 1185 across the River Heron. Originally, the bridge consisted of 22 arches, but due to",
          "these are the 4 remaining arches of the once 22 counting bridge over the river Rhone. With a little ancient chapel on it, quite exceptional this is. Entrance fee 5 Euro, but worth it.",
          "It is near the Pope's Palace, but it is not easy to get there if you don't understand French. The view is beautiful.",
          "Enter the bridge from the enterence inside the city wall. Up one set of stairs. Buy your ticket in combination with the Palais de Papes. You can also access a section of the city wall but that's better done from the public park above the bridge. The bridge obviously doesnt reach",
          "Great visit to a must-see feature of Avignon. On the day we visited, the Rhone River was smooth and glassy, so we had some wonderful reflections, adding to the beauty of the site. Great views of the bridge can be had from a track on the river bank just to the east. From the",
          "The song actually said \"Sous le pont... \" as per the information shared, there was no space to dance ON the bridge. Interesting history this bridge, worth the visit!",
          "From memory, the ticket to this bridge cost only a couple of euro if bought in conjunction with a ticket to the Palais du Papes. We were even able to use the two tickets on two separate days, since it was too late in the day to visit both when we arrived.",
          "It's one of the icons of Avignon, so it's worth seeing just for that, and the views of the Ile and the Rh\u00f4ne are great. But it's just half a bridge, and I only spent about 10 minutes on it. Try to buy a combined ticket with the Palais des Papes to get your money's worth",
          "You can actually see the bridge walking or driving alongside the river where you will get a better position to photograph the bridge. It is worth a visit if you have time.",
          "The small museum at the beginning has the full history of the iconic bridge. That does not reach the other bank. Also has a display with many versions of the song through the ages.",
          "Like Pont du Gard in Niems, the Pont d'Avignon offers some well-preserved medieval architecture that possesses its own architectual beauty. As impressive are the city wall which survives as if it was just built. If medieval history and structure are interests, both the bridge",
          "Built in 1177 in wood, it was destroyed by Louie VIII around 40 years later. It was rebuilt in 1234 in stone but closed in 1633 due to being partially destroyed by flooding of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Still in rather good shape. The Chapel of St Nicholas sits on the second pier. World",
          "This is a great place to visit for all the family for only 5 euros per head. Beautiful architecture and there are great views of the Rh\u00f4ne. There are also ancient artefacts like cannon balls and the original timbers from the bridge. Their is a disabled lift to access the bridge",
          "We decided to battle the large crowds to enjoy some time on the iconic Pont d\u2019Avignon. Sadly it was a bit disappointing. The guide is definitely worth taking as it has quite a bit of helpful information. There is little to see here as much of the bridge is in ruins. It does",
          "Listed as an historical landmark, and based on prior reviews, we took a short walk from our hotel, walked down from the far side of the square opposite the Palais de Pape, through one of the city gates and up the stairs to the entrance of the bridge. An entrance fee let us",
          "Another historic site that is a must do visit location. Easy to reach by foot from the popes Palace. Hand set that allows you to hear the history of the bridge is clear and interesting",
          "Well it only goes partly across the River but if you grew up singing that song as a kid, \u201cSur le Pont d'Avignon L'on y danse, l'on y danse\u201d how can you not miss it. There is a small and informative museum st the entrance and although it won\u2019t take long to see, be a part of",
          "My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Provence and earlier today went on a Les Croisieres Mireio Cruise (Review to follow) on the Rh\u00f4ne River Avignon to Arles. On departing at 1130;hours, one of the first things to catch our eye was the Pont Saint-Benezet and this",
          "Who could go to Avignon without visiting the bridge? As part of a walk around the gardens behind the palace of the Popes the view from from above and on the bridge is lovely. There's also a film show at the bridge telling of its history and construction .",
          "Took audio guide tour here. Very interesting history for this bridge. Those mistral winds made it difficult to stand out there to listen to the guide.",
          "From the hights of the Palais des Popes, the bridge is quite cool since you get the view of the half bridge in the river. But when you walk out on the bridge you will find it strange that it was not rebuilt. It\u2019s cool to have been walking on the bridge, but it was cooler to see",
          "One of a kind bridge. It was extremely windy when we visited so we did not stay long. It offers a great panaromic view of the river banks and the back of the Palais des Papes.",
          "Lovely experience to view and walk upon the site near the original Pont d\u2019Avignon. Buy a joint ticket with the Popes Palace - good value and close by.",
          "While visiting the Palace of the Popes, this bridge can be seen (and also visited). It is an ancient bridge built by the Romans but repeatedly broken by the strong waters of the Rh\u00f4ne river. So it is now just a tourist site rather than a bridge.",
          "We would rather recommend to go on the other side of the bridge to have the view on it. The visit in itself does not bring much. Only an interesting 15min video on the bridge history.",
          "This is the image in my mind when I think of Avignon. We were on a riverboat this time and seeing the bridge from the water was a lovely new view for me.",
          "the legend that made it famous is nice. but the bridge itself is not that spectacular if you have high expectations.",
          "The Pont Saint-Benezet is a very unusual bridge in as much as you cannot cross it. This has been the case for hundreds of years as all but four arches have been washed away during floods. One can buy combined tickets with the Popes Palace which are very good value also the",
          "The bridge is famous due to the song. Other than that, there is nothing special nor spectacular about it.",
          "After being disappointed we couldn't get into the Popes Palace, we were happy to be able to park right alongside the Bridge & get a good look at it (particularly good seeing as we completely missed it on our last visit). It's special because of the song written about it - but",
          "I've been singing the song about this bridge since I was in the 7th grade and finally now I got to see it! There isn't a lot of it left, but what is left is beautiful!",
          "Actually nothing very special , but nice to be on the bridge which is the theme of sich a famous song everybody knows from his childhood although not being French.",
          "Although I did not go right up to the Pont d'Avignon, I was happy to see it from a city bus as I crossed the river on the next bridge up, just because of the famous and quaint song. Interesting history, too, if you care to look that up.",
          "To be fair, going on the bridge is not as thrilling from a tourist perspective as it is to see it from outside. The reason to go here is to listen to the audio guide to hear the myths surrounding the bridge and to see the exhibit about how it was used and how it has been",
          "my childhood dream got real.. i did danced! Very well explained story and history of the bridge. You cannot miss it in Avignon!",
          "We went to the bridge, it looked nice (as other impressive historic buildings. When you want to enter the bridge you have to pay a fare (around 20\u20ac). I think is kinda overpriced.",
          "Who ever heard of paying to walk on an old bridge? You can see this from nearby, save your euros and don't pay.",
          "Ok it's half a bridge! Historical in a way but only because of the song. Definitely wouldn't pay to walk on it. Good view from the little free ferry that crosses the river.",
          "It was a cool experience to be able to walk on the bridge that is missing one end of it. There is a nice audio guide, but it plays the song of the Pont d'Avignon, which you can't get out of your head!",
          "My late Mom use to sing to me as a child the famous French song Sur le pont D'avignon...so here I am some 65 years later singing and dancing myself on this famous bridge",
          "Amazing that you can charge for someone to walk onto a bridge but they do here! OK, it\u2019s interesting and historical, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of other much finer bridges. OK, if you\u2019re into very old bridges!",
          "Enjoyed walking out on the bridge and looking back at the town. They offer lots of information on the history.",
          "Nicely arranged and operated tourist attraction. Can be combined with a ticket to Palais Des Papes Doesn\u2019t take long but well worth doing",
          "the bridge is an interesting view into history. The idea that the bridge kept getting destroyed - how the bridge changed over time. I enjoyed the research into the how the bridge was built.",
          "We saw it while strolling along the wallpaper. Especially beautiful at night. A great piece of architecture",
          "As far as bridges go, this one is among the most overrated. You\u2019ll find much prettier and more impressive sights in the region, and even within the city. If you combine it with the Palais des Papes, it might be worth considering. Otherwise, just go for the free view from the",
          "The bridge has an interesting history, some unusual features and a glorious view of the Rhone. It's well worth a visit, especially as it's only a small extra optional cost when you buy a ticket to enter the Palais des Papes. There is an exhibition at the entrance to the bridge,",
          "How could you go to Avignon and not visit the bridge, famous for its Sur La Pont song? Even though there is only half a bridge left, with just 3 arches remaining, this is a must see. Best view of it is from the lavender beds.",
          "Nice views. Some history, some exercise. Worth going. Recommend before closing to get sunset and the smaller crowds. Would not recommend during day.",
          "Sure, it's just half an old bridge - but a lot of fun to immerse yourself in the history of it and to walk across the drawbridge to the middle of the river. Different perspective of the whole area.",
          "The audio guide was really good and filled in the history of this famous bridge. I enjoyed the experience of being there and being able to walk on it and learn more about it\u2019s history. I would recommend a visit.",
          "This part bridge is very well known and an icon of Avignon. You can walk on it so you can say just that but there is not much to see,",
          "The bridge from the famous song.... Not much to see, but very nice... A visit to Avignon would not be complete without it. Die Br\u00fccke aus dem bekannten Lied: Nicht viel zum entdecken aber trotzdem sehr nett.",
          "Tip straight away: If you do the papal palace first, you can get a ticket for here too. Interesting story behind the bridge. Audioguide brings story to life. Museum and films add further information. Good spot to take photos on a warm summers day.",
          "Beautiful bridge of Pont d\u2019Avignon, great place to visit and see this iconic bridge. A must see whilst visiting the old town, they\u2019re can be a long wait to walk across the bridge, if you have patience, then do so \ud83d\udc9a",
          "The remains of this bridge, although much reduced from its former glory, are a great reminder of how the Romans conquered and occupied so much in their heyday. Not much to see here but still worth the time and effort to visit!",
          "We spent a day in Avignon sight seeing and purchased a double ticket for Le Palais and Le Pont. If only because of the evocative chanson the Pont is a must see ... be prepared to prepared to be underwhelmed. Go to Orange instead to see the Th\u00e9atre Antique.",
          "We all sang \"Sur le Pont\" together and the setting was wonderful. We had passed several times in the week, but to stand there was more moving. Construction is impressive, and the end? It remains without completion.",
          "We danced across the bridge with our French friends and learned all about the Pont d\u2019Avignon. For us as Americans we understand its significance, from leading the song in French class. But for the French, this is some where they brings back happy memories of their youth. I",
          "When in Avignon this bridge is a Must See Cost to go on the bridge is about 5 euro This includes a head set to listen to the amazing history of the bridge",
          "You sang about it in your french class, now come and walk on it and enjoy the feeling of really being in France. The bridge is amazing as is all the other things in Avignon",
          "While only a part exists, the history of the bridge and the views of it from surrounding areas (from Rocher des Dames or from below) are nice!",
          "So if you did French at school in England there is a good chance you learned the song \u201cSur Le pont d\u2019Avignon\u201d for that reason alone it\u2019s worth going onto the remaining part of the bridge which once boasted 22 arches. If it\u2019s windy in May, it will be a bit chilly.",
          "Highly recommend the audio tour of the Pont St Benezet. Blends results of archeological, cultural, and written research to explain the use of the bridge over a period of 7-8 centuries. 3-D visualization derived from research shows the bridge in one of it's original Rhone",
          "Nice to visit when you stay in Avignon. But there are more places to visit. It is a short walk and a lot of tourists.",
          "Entry is 5\u20ac with an audio device that shares the story of the Bridge of Avignon. You can buy a 15\u20ac ticket that allows entry to the Bridge + Pope\u2019s Palace. Good value.",
          "You cannot visit Avignon without visiting the bridge although the view of it from the gardens up from the cathedral is probably as good as anything. It was closed while the Mistral was blowing strongly.",
          "What is intriguing about this bridge is how it was engineered and constructed which is part of the audiotape. I found the history fascinating along with the engineering and construction! The audio is a must for insight into the why of its present state.",
          "The bridge is conveniently located opposite the historical centre of Avignon. There is an interesting history. Architecturally it is not unique or engaging.",
          "Okay, there\u2019s decent views from the bridge and ramparts and there\u2019s a bit of interesting history on the plaques but no compelling reason to come other than the afore mentioned and the fact that Avignon is so small it\u2019s impossible to pass up.",
          "While the bridge itself is beautiful, what I enjoyed about the audio tour was all of the information about the research that was done to figure out how the bridge was built and what it looked like before it was destroyed by an ice floe in the 1600s. The staff was friendly and",
          "Go and tell people you have danced \"sur le Pont D'Avignon\". Learn about the history of the original bridge which was finished in the 13th century. Very good audio presentation which was free with the ticket. Very comprehensive and interesting. It is only a short bridge now but",
          "Having just visited Palais du Papes, this historic feature was anticlimactic. Worth reading about and perhaps a nice view up and down river for photos, it doesn\u2019t match the Palais for quality of audio presentation. Spend the extra time in the Palais!",
          "The less mobile will be relieved to learn that there is a lift up to the bridge and its museum. This is an interesting and informative place to visit, giving the history of the building of the bridge and the reasons for its destruction. You will also learn about the song that",
          "Once this was a bridge from the mainland to the island in the Rhone. It was a way to escape the heat and crowds of Avignon. The real name is Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet. And today is only a four arch section. You can gain entry by purchasing an inexpensive ticket.",
          "Beginning in 1234 the bridge was rebuilt with 22 stone arches. It was abandoned in the mid-17th century as the arches tended to collapse each time the Rh\u00f4ne flooded making it very expensive to maintain. Four arches and the gatehouse at the Avignon end of the bridge have",
          "Just go on it nearer to 5pm. Sheer breathtaking view and let yourself relax as u stand at the end of the bridge. Enjoy that quiet inside ;-)",
          "Having visited most of the main museums and monuments recently in Avignon, I feel this is probably the best. The views from the bridge are stunning, the audioguide is easy to use, and very interesting, If you go to Avignon, go on one of their map walks (there are three), choose",
          "Everyone has heard and sung or danced to Sur le pont d\u2019Avignon yet few get to do it while standing on the actual structure. Only some of the bridge survives but enough to make it fascinating. With good views of the river, town and countryside it is a great photo point. Must do.",
          "Of course you wouldn't visit Avignon without seeing it's most known landmark, even having it's own song...!",
          "This bridge is filled with French history! Must go see and walk out to see all of the details and learn what has happened here over the centuries. I learned the song, \"Sur le pont d'Avignon,\" as my first French song (probably after \"Frere Jacques\"), and wanted to see the bridge",
          "Almost everyone who\u2019s taken French in school can sing Sur Le Pont d\u2019Avignon. Buy a combined ticket with the Papal Palace and find out what the full bridge looked like, why it collapsed, and why the people of Avignon danced under and not on the Pont. Take time to watch the",
          "Make sure you buy a combined ticket for both events as they are discounted. The audio tour is very well presented and easy to follow. It tells the story of how the bridge was thought out and built. There is also a film area below the bridge that shows how it would have been",
          "We passed this bridge both directions by ship and it is a remarkable construction when you consider the wildness of the river in Medieval times and the construction techniques used. There is a way to go out on the bridge as well.",
          "The famous pont d'Avignon can be visited together with the Palais des papes and is certainly worth the short trip. This is the original bridge made famous by the popular song. The bridge has been partially destroyed over the centuries and no longer spans the river. It is",
          "The bridge is half across the Rhine tributary due to it being destroyed in the old times due to floods but it shows the skill of the people in those times without modern equipment. Can be visited when one is visiting the Papal Palace and Rocher des Doms.",
          "Make it here at sunrise. The calm and the skies give it a new dimension and you can see the town wake up. You will also have the place to yourself.",
          "Visiting the pont Saint-B\u00e9nezet is worthwhile especially when you follow the audio tour not in the appropriate order: if you visit the film (in the cellar at the entrance of the bridge) first you get a much better understanding of the bridge itself",
          "Not to be missed, this famous bridge offers excellent views of the Rhone river, Isle de Piot and surrounding countryside, and the walled city of Avignon with the Popes' Palace overlooking it all. Very photogenic!",
          "We walked down along the river from where our ship was docked to Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet. This famous bridge is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Construction was finished in the 13th century and it was of huge importance at the time, but flooding repeatedly damaged the bridge; ongoing",
          "We came here to dance on the bridge (obviously) but it\u2019s sewn up with entry fees and you can\u2019t get on out of hours - we were just too late... Had to make do with ogling it from the bank The city is beautifully historic but no good for granny - steep steps and inclined streets",
          "Worth the visit and it takes about an hour to go through the whole audio guide tour. It was quite windy out, so we didn\u2019t stay very long.",
          "At least, this is half the one, as it only goes to the middle of the river. However, it is THE pont d'Avignon, so a must-see. Best to cross over the river by the adjacent road bridge for good photos - either with the snow-capped mountains or the old city in the background.",
          "Ever since childhood this place was fascinating being the basis for the song we all had to learn in French class in school. Being there for that short time was one of those memories that you need on the \u201cbucket\u201d list. The eco Erie center takes you back many centuries and leaves",
          "TO to be charged to walk on a 1/5th of a pile of stones bridge is absolutely ridiculous....shame on you Mayor of AVIGNON !!!!",
          "Pont d'Avignon.... history, song, great view of the river and surroundings. we quite enjoyed our tour to this famous bridge after visiting Pope's Palace. 5 star spot, not to be missed",
          "You can hardly visit Avignon and not visit the famous \u2018pont\u2019. The day we visited was windy and that made for an exhilarating experience, but well worthwhile. Highly recommended if you\u2019re in the area.",
          "How can a trip to Avignon be complete without visiting the Pont d\u2019Avignon? On a sunny day in November, it was a bit chilly and windy. However, the views were spectacular! Worth the time.",

          "To finally walk on the bridge of the famous ditty during one's French classes in the good old school days is a sort of amusing achievement. The bridge itself is a historic landmark; an \"I was there\" moment. When we visited, the sky, the flowing river and the autumn foliage on",

          "It\u2019s has a beautiful medieval architecture. If you bought it online with the Palais totally worth it. If not, the entrance only to the pont is 5\u20ac (expensive I think). Better to walk and take photos from across the river.",
          "Pont Saint-Benezet [circa 1171], also know as the Pont d'Avignon of the nursery-rhyme. was one of only three bridges that crossed the Rhone River in the Middle Ages. Even though only four arches remain today. it's easy to see how magnificent this bridge was in its heyday.",
          "This strange bridge is worth visit. You will get Access to this bridge with same ticket as to Palais des Papes. With family ticket increase for whole fmily is only one euro. It don't take much time to visit, maybe 15 minutes.",
          "A must see in Avignon, but quite disappointing if you ask me. the bridge has a long history. You get an audio guide on entering the site.",
          "You cannot visit Avignon without seeing the bridge which has featured in the song you probably learned at school. There is a cost associated with it (we bought a joint ticket for the Palais des Papes and the bridge) and you can have an audio guided tour if you wish, though we",
          "We finally found our way down to the Pont d\u2019Avignon. There are very few signs to follow from the Pope\u2019s Palace down to the bridge. A group of students finally showed us the way. Once there you have to pay to enter before you can walk out on the bridge. The bridge is damaged so",
          "It's a bridge so its not really that interesting, but I think they've managed to get a pretty good activity out of it. Was informative and worth the price.",
          "Sure this is a pretty bridge, but I\u2019m piqued by the history of how it got to be in its current state. There was a flood that washed out the bridge. The pope was only willing to pay for half of the restoration, but the government felt only the pope and his people use the bridge",
          "Part of the tour that included the Papal palace. Great guide with plenty of information walked to the end of the bridge and sang the song",
          "It was okay, not sure it was worth the cost, though. Bridge is unfinished and looks odd that way. There was an audio guide,tour of it.",
          "I visited this attraction as part of a dual ticket with the Pope\u2019s Palace and had a great time. The visit is accompanied by an audio guide that provides information on the bridge. The bridge was more than just a bridge as it also contains a site of worship and played an",
          "We stayed in Avignon and walked around seeing sites. The bridge is fantastic and there is huge parkland which is very high up so you get a great view down to the bridge. Avignon is a beautiful place.",
          "A visit to Avignon is not complete with out a visit to Pont Saint-Benezet (Pont d'Avignon) there is a charge if you want to walk on it,but there are other areas that you can view it from.",
          "The photos you see make this attraction seem better than it is. Looks better from afar than it does when actually on it. That said it is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Everyone sees this bridge when in Avignon, so do see it. But I felt that seeing it from a distance was more interesting than visiting the bridge itself.",
          "I really just wanted to walk this ancient bridge since I learned the folk song about it at the age of 7. Entrance came with an audio tour, entrance to the upper and lower chapel on the bridge and fantastic views of the city. You learn more about the bridge and its problems,",
          "Who could resist to go on 'The Bridge' of Avignon!! Seriously,it is nice to walk out on the historic bridge over the Rhone river and look back at the City and its' medieval walls. Great picture spots are available from the bridge of the old City and the Papal palace.",
          "There is, apparently, a popular song in French about the Pont d'Avignon. Our tour guide sang it, but I had no idea what was going on. This is a half-remaining bridge right outside of Avignon. There is a fee (something like 5 Euros) and includes an audio tour. The whole",
          "Firstly it is not a bridge just a big jetty or pier into the River Rhone as it doesnt go anywhere. 5 euros to walk on the jetty for all of a 100 yards is wrong when the bridge fell into the river 300 years ago. Wouldn't even be on the map had it not been for a stupid nursery",
          "What I wanted was to see the bridge so I didn\u2019t pay to walk on the bridge but rather I walked along the path alongside the river where I got a great view of the bridge, exactly what I was after. In my opinion there is no need to pay to walk on the bridge if what you are after is",
          "When we were there, there was a family with small children singing \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\", which added hugely to the experience. We were there on a sunny summer evening, and while the bridge itself is lovely, the views from the bridge were even better.",
          "Well worth a visit, good info boards if you don\u2019t want audio set. As well as the bridge you can walk part of the battlement wall. Disabled lift if you need to avoid the stairs. Security check at the gate seemed a bit over the top, but there we go!",
          "Self guided, audio tour provides good information about the bridge\u2019s history. Easy walking. Worth a visit!!",
          "Interesting but get the audio tour to really appreciate, and watch the 3d research video to learn more. Good spot for photo back to old city.",
          "Nice and interesting, but please update the audio guides. We came from Papal palace and couldn\u2019t help thinking - wow this experience sucks! Charging 5 eur a person for what is essentially un maintained for tourists is a shame. Just walk 5 minutes to Papal palace and learn a",
          "The bridge is well worth a visit, situated on the beautiful Loire River. It reminded me of my childhood when we learnt the song' Sur le pont D'Avignon'. A serene spot.",
          "If you do nothing else in Avignon you must pay a visit to this bridge! At 5 euros it is value for money too. The handset you are given is full of interesting facts and the video presentation explains pictorially the reason the bridge is only half complete. Make sure you sing the",
          "Don't miss a visit here. We saw it in passing and decide to stroll that way in evening..It was beautiful and so peaceful",
          "It's the famous bridge immortalized in the French song \"sur le point d'Avignon\" that every child learns in France. Nice view from the end of the bridge looking back towards Avignon. Interesting chapel built into the bridge halfway \"across\".",
          "We hired a private guide for the afternoon and she took us around Avignon. First stop was Pont Saint-Benezet. The bridge was built in the 1100\u2019s and damaged several years later. Many restorations happened but in the end only four arches remain. She did an excellent job",
          "This bridge has local significance but was more of a curiosity for us. We bought the ticket as part of the Palace of the Popes tour but it wouldn't have been on our agenda otherwise.",
          "The second must see of Avignon and you defendly need to listen to the song first before you visit the Pont d\u2019Avignon. The bridge is one with an old historical story. The tour that you can combine in one ticket with the Palace of Popes offers a audio tour that tells you the",
          "It's just a bit of bridge sticking into the river but between the audio guide and the movie and material on the walls you learn quite a bit about the history and how a lot of the history was discovered. We enjoyed listening to the various versions of the song including reggae",
          "Must see in Avignon, walking accessible, take lots of pictures and don't go on the weekends, less crowded",
          "Was very hot on day we went which meant moving quickly between few shaded areas. Fascinating history and great reconstruction on film at end of trip. Well worth the money.",
          "You can of course choose to pay and walk out on the bridge, but you can see it from so many places it seemed unecessary to us.",
          "worth paying, although we went on a free day! More to it than meets the eye, good little interpretation section and good views.",
          "This is one of the key sites and is worth a visit. But make sure you come back at night as its illuminated and looks great",
          "Great views of the river Rhone. Fantastic story attached to this historic monument. Not very well signposted as to where and how much it cost to go onto the bridge. Best to get a combined ticket for the Palace Du Papes and Pong D\u2019Avignon, as that is much easier.",
          "The Pont D'Avignon was a nice diversion from the crowded streets. They provided a free audio tour with entrance. It provided a thorough history lesson! I loved standing at the end of the bridge on the water. It provided a refreshing breeze on a hot day!",
          "I honestly don\u2019t know why you would pay to go on this short little bridge. You are not missing anything by just looking at it from the promenade or a better view from the gardens high up on the hill",
          "Good audio tour of this famous bridge. Well worth a visit if you are in the city. Good views from the bridge",
          "Nice place to go for a quick stroll and admiring both the bridge and the views of the river and the walls of the Palais des Papes. Enjoyable.",
          "A combined entry ticket can be purchased with the Palais des Papes which saves a few Euro and I would say was well worth it because they are both must see attractions if you have any interest in history. The entry fee comes with an audio tour which is very informative if not as",
          "Hard to image that this was a bridge of some 22 arches across the Rhone built in response to a vision. Very picturesque and photogenic. You can visit - 4euros - stairs are involved - it gets very hot around lunchtime so prepare your visit accordingly. The song was first sung",
          "Beautiful place to visit, be it at day or dusk. Apart from going on the bridge also visit the other side of the river (a short walk away by taking the other bridge close by)- the view from there is stunning. Also visit the Garden next to the Avignon Cathedral, from here too the",
          "It is really unique and interesting, as well as one of the most popular bridges in France. Best views are seen from the top of Rocher des doms.",
          "Yes, this is the famous bridge from the old song, and it is not very common for a bridge to end in the middle of the river. But apart from that, there is not much that verifies the entry fee.",
          "Visited with my husband and baby. The bridge itself is quite magnificent and it was wonderful to finally learn the history and the legend too. Definitely worth a visit when in Avignon.",
          "The bridge was included in our tickets to Palais de Papes. Walking down to the bridge from the gardens is a great approach. Walking out on it is cool, but the film explaining the history of the bridge is excellent",
          "Wonderful legends and stories around the building of this bridge. Thoroughly recommend the visit, but get the audio guide :-)",
          "Historical place and beautiful bridge. A bit windy and quite busy with tourist especially on high summer but its all worth it.",
          "First impressions can be wrong(totally in this case). I saw the \u20ac5 charge and I thought it was cheeky to charge this to walk across half a bridge. However this site turned out to be one of the highlights of my month in France. I didn\u2019t realise that bridges had that much of an",
          "Lovely visit but crammed with tourists. Head over to tour Phillipe bell on other fork of the river for amazing views of the Palais de pope and an interesting 3D visualisation of how the bridge looked in medieval times \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Amazing to have walked on this bridge knowing the history and the age dating back to the 12th century - there is also an audio guided tour available. Great photo opportunity.",
          "Worth a visit. Worth getting be free Audio guides too. Take your time walking along the bridge. Lots to consider. Good facilities.",
          "Great little stop to visit. We were part of a tour and the location is well organized, with audio guides available. Small museum room at the entrance of the bridge and gift shop. Washrooms onsite as well. Bridge is very picturesque, many spots to tack pictures of the town,",
          "Very good value for money, an informative audio guide, such interesting history, architecture and plenty of opportunities for some postcard worthy snaps. Maybe only took an hour to go around everything",
          "FAB. excellent. Could have spent all day here. Surely the whole point of visiting Avignon is to experience THE BRIDGE.",
          "Interesting story, nice walk along the bridge but several tours arrived when we were there and made it too busy.",
          "If you were taught the Pont d\u2019Avignon song as a child, this is a charming visit. But don\u2019t expect much from this stop ... You must pay but can get a special rate if you also visit other spots (Palais des Papes). They offer audioguides to enhance your visit. You will share",
          "We were basically \"killing time\"; we'd already seen the bridge from the river and the road, however, decided to walk on it too. So glad we did, it is really, really worth it! The museum and film are excellent, and with the free audio guide too you are very well looked after and",
          "It would of course be impossible to come to Avignon and not go to see the Pont St Benezet (sur le pont Avignon). There is a small entry charge (5 euros for adults) to walk on the bridge, with an audio guide included in the price. There are 6 stopping points with audioguide",
          "Of course here at Pont d'Avignon. The history of the bridge, the bridge is interesting in itself does not amount to much. View the bridge from the Palace/Castle",
          "A breath-taking view of this bridge across the river Rhone was an unforgettable memory that will stay with me forever. This is one of the iconic landmarks of the Avignon province. Within the neighbourhood is the Avignon Cathedral and Palais des Papes. This should be a must to do",
          "Walk half way across the Rhome on the Pont d\u2019Avignon. Greta historical site. Have a slow walk across and spend a few moments enjoying the river.",
          "This is much more than just a walk across the bridge. V good 3-D films of the engineering behind the bridge & audioguide providing historical context. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",
          "From childhood, I learned the little French song, \"Sur le pont d'Avignon\", and was thrilled the first time I was able to see and walk on this historic bridge!",
          "Quick visit is all that is required. The view back to Avignon and the Palais de Papes with the gardens was pretty.",
          "Funny theatrics aside (dancing to the children's song we learned in Canada) it was a pleasure to learn about the history of this famous bridge through the headset over 8 stations.",
          "The view on the river is beautiful it made for beautiful photos, but what made this visit even more worth it was the documentary they showed in the basement (with great Air conditioning) about the history of this bridge and explained why it is no longer in one piece (using",
          "If it\u00b4s a hot day, this will be one one the hottest places then :D There is not much to do at the bridge, but you will get nice photos from there.",
          "This bridge made history thanks to the dream of a young lad, Benezat. It is forever linked to the name of Avignon, the papal city. Take the time to visit it and take an audio guide, it is worth it.",
          "Bought with a Papal palace ticket well worth it. Flat shoes a must, walk further along the river bank and get yhe free ferry to see from the island.",
          "the experience of reaching half of this historic bridge that then collapses in the Rhone is really impressive. It's the mosta magical bridge in France. But for those who know the song \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" it is also nice to see the French families who climb on the bridge and",
          "You can't come to Avignon w/o seeing its famous bridge. The video is interesting learning the societal part of a bridge of long ago & how it was uncovered.",
          "Historical? Yes. Worth a paid visit? No. You'll get your best photos will be while you not on the bridge. The entrance is easy to get to and is right near one of the entrances to the old town. If you're in the heart of old town near the carousel, it is less than a 5 minute walk",
          "Whilst on our river cruise we were taken here. We were given plenty of time to look around and take photographs. We were told about the history of the bridge, it is actually built on three levels. Easy place to walk around and there is also a museum there.",
          "We had a joint ticket to the Palace of the Popes and this bridge and my Initial reaction was why pay to go on a bridge. However, it was well worth it and historically very interesting, as well as being able to take some great shots of Avignon and the Palace.",
          "Le pond d\u2019Avignon is well known for everyone ho ever learned french , because of the homonym song, therefore we visited also. Is impressive than only 4 arch remained from 11. On the bridge, just a long and hot stroll, i would not repeated, especially if the time is linitrd. We",
          "Good place to visit her photographs off the river and the incomplete bridge it is also easy to get there as it is right at the entrance to the main part of Avignon Nearby parking is available and is reasonably priced",
          "The place is pretty much as described...it\u2019s a bridge. However, there was a small museum section about the investigation of the historical bridge that was fascinating.",
          "The bridge is an iconic sight in Avignon and should not be missed. Do you need to go out on the bridge and pay entrance? Not really, the views from the bridge will exclude the main sight - the bridge. I found better places for seeing the bridge namely up on the hill but best on",
          "Not the biggest tourist attraction by a long way, but do some research and savour the history. A simple addition to a tourist agenda in a terrific French town surrounded by history from roman times.",
          "The Saint-B\u00e9nezet bridge had some decent photo opportunities but overall wasn\u2019t that special. The audioguide was digital and hard to use in the sun. There really wasn\u2019t much to see- after all it was only a bridge. It\u2019s kind of interesting for the first few minutes, but if you\u2019re",
          "If you go into the Rocher des Doms park, you can get a good vantage point for taking pictures of the Pont d'Avignon bridge. I called it the Bridge to Nowhere.",
          "We bought tickets for the bridge at the same time as the palais des papes so unsure how much it would be on its own. We thought the joint tickets were good value for money. There isn\u2019t lots to see as the bridge has obviously collapsed over time but it\u2019s well worth a look as you",
          "It only costs Euro 7.50 but it's really not a long visit. If the Mistral is blowing, hold onto Kids and older adults. It can blow at 60 mph or more. I guess this is a 'checklist' item; you have to go on the Bridge at Avignon, but the best views of the bridge are from the river",
          "A popular French children's song is about dancing under the bridge at Avignon, the famous Pont d'Avignon. Bring your dancing shoes! There is a lovely walk that goes to and under the bridge. A walk on the bridge is nice too. It does not cross the river any longer. Great for",
          "So we've all grown up with the famous song, and they didn't really dance on the Pont d'Avignon (they danced near it) but somehow the exhibits make this venerated landmark fresh. The audioguide is hard to hear when there's wind (apparently Avignon meant river of high winds in",

          "We visited the bridge and Palace des papes together and then it's well worth the money. The bridge itself is interesting, but not a major attraction. The audiotour is nice and informative, although I think they should give young children one as well, because our son always wants",
          "We had a fun day traveling around this bridge to nowhere and walking out to the edge of what is left of the bridge. I think this would be a good excursion for the able bodied. I don't think it would be accessible to someone in a wheelchair.",
          "Excellent value for money - 5 euros per adult, which includes an audio guide. A good mix of facts and stories about the bridge and it's history. Plenty of opportunity to take some good photos from the bridge and the surrounding area. The ticket office is air conditioned and",
          "I am a music teacher and for what feels like decades I have taught the tune to \"Pont d'Avignon\" to generations of students. For me it was fun to see. There it is. It exists! That said: it's half a bridge. I suspect it is much more fun during the festival of which the song",
          "You have to make the effort to walk to the end of the bridge, even though it was not as spectacular as I was hoping. I purchased a combined ticket for the bridge and a boat trip which worked out decently priced.",

          "This is a must do item on any agenda for Avignon, and doesn\u2019t disappoint. The entry price is reasonable and includes an audioguide, which was very detailed. The only comment I would make is that it is not so easy to spot the Athens of the visit, however this is a recommended",

          "Unless you have a special desire to dance on the Pont de Avignon you can skip this site. In spring and summer it can be hot a sunny. Best to view the bridge from above or below. Did not see much point in visiting, especially given the fee.",
          "We bought a combined Palace/Bridge Ticket which saved money. The story of the bridge before you walk out and back is what makes it interesting. Very large timber stakes/posts dredged up from the river makes it real. Small Chapel part of the way out is quite stark. When busy be",
          "The Post D'Avignon is just a bridge; nothing more. Half of it is gone. But I defy anyone to look at the bridge and not have the tune going through your head. It is not a \"bucket list\" item but it was fun to have seen it. I'd recommend visiting the bridge while you are in",
          "When in Avignon this is obviously a must see as it is so famous. Try to get views from the opposite side of the river so your photo's are not spoiled by the constant traffic that passes by. I can't help but feel it is another tourist trap though as you have to pay to actually",

          "We cruised past this bridge (and stopped for a while) during a Southern France river cruise. For historic reasons quite interesting to see. I believe if you are on foot it costs you to access it, Not sure if it is worth it, but we certainly had a great view from our boat.",
          "This bridge has so much history and it blends completely with the overall magnificence of this city. It is a pity a part has been lost but overall you have great views of the city from here",
          "We didn't know the song and we bought the combined ticket with the Pope's Palace but I'm actually really glad we did the bridge. You get the little handset which tells you all about the history of the bridge - shame mine didn't work but everyone else's did. The little chapel",
          "Well. It is obviously a must-see but it is also true that you get a much better view of the bridge from the city/shores. Whether it is worth paying to go up there... is at the discretion of each visitor. There is indeed little tobsee and do when you are on the bridge itself,",
          "It is worth having a look but I would not recommend buying a ticket to actually walk the bridge - there's nothing there to see that cannot be seen from the riverbank. Another vantage point from where it can be seen is a nearby rocher des doms park.",

          "worth the visit and the stroll through the old town to visit was marvelous The Old bridge is a good vantage point for people messing about on the river and was well worth the small entrance fee",
          "I walked the length of this Medieval bridge, which no longer goes anywhere, in about 7 minutes and saw little in the process except the Rhone River on both sides. I opted to skip the audio guide that comes with admission because I already knew the history of this 13-foot-wide",
          "This is a must due to the song. A combined ticket for this and the Palais du Papes is only 14.5 Euros and is really worth it.",
          "Tourists might think that paying to visit a bridge which ends in the middle of a river was a waste of time - but with the Pont d'Avignon they would be wrong! Exhibition material, videos and a good audio guide provide a fascinating insight into the construction, history and",
          "The score of five is simply because of the history of the bridge. Essentially, it is an old and damaged bridge that no longer spans the river. However, its history and fame make it a touist must see. Whether you are a romantic, a history buff, or just, like me, an ordinary",
          "You surely can't visit Avignon without going to the bridge. We visited in pouring rain but it didn't stop us from having a bit of a Morecame and Wise dance on it. 5 Euro entry fee. Good short film about the original bridge. Pleasant hour spent.",
          "It was thrilling to actually see the Pont d'Avignon after singing the song as a child. So many of us remember that tune from their childhood. We were not able to actually visit the bridge due to the strong winds, but we saw it several times from various different vantage points",
          "I can't remember not knowing the tune 'Sur le Pont D'Avignon' and so visiting the bridge was for me a must. There's a great audio guide that explains the construction, it's history and the cause of its end which is very informative. The walk along the bridge and the views from",
          "We had a combined ticket for the Pope's Palace and bridge 14.50 euros this includes an audio guide for the bridge. not much left of the bridge but the history is interesting and the whole experience is well thought out. Added bonus of excellent spot for photos of Avignon.",
          "How can you come to this town and not visit this bridge, which is the theme of a famous French nursery rhyme. I had personally never heard the rhyme before my visit, and now cannot get the catchy little ditty out of my head. Google it. Anyway, the bridge is lovely on a",
          "For what it was, it's quite expensive. But at the end of the day - it's the Pont d'Avignon. It's a must for all sightseers. If you want to do the Popes Palace, get the joint ticket. It will save you money. You can do this attraction quite quickly, if you don't want to read all",
          "We visited at 1800hrs an hour before closing time and it was very quiet with the odd other tourist there, we have been here before but that was in the middle of the day and it was too busy. We didn\u2019t have the audio guide which was part of the ticket price, but did enjoy a",
          "We don't understand the negative reviews. We did not know much about the bridge, we came, we learned, and left educated. This is a well-maintained site, that everyone knows from the song. The audio guide gives more background information that helped us put out Avignon experience",
          "This place is highly overrated in my opinion. It is certainly famous for the song with the pont d'Avignon, but otherwise neither the location, or the story itself are too attractive. A visit does not teach one too much, there are some explanations available, but not interesting",
          "Yes - you need to see it. The tour they offer is nice and well made. As this is a French Momerial definitely worth a visit.",
          "While I had heard the nursery rhyme the actual story of the bridge is much more impressive, and this is told through an exhibition in the basement of the tower entrance, used as much as a toll gate for river traffic as a bridge to cross the river, the original stepping stoned",
          "Walking the street around old town was excellent from the Popes residence to various open spaces, just meandering arond the streets and buildings, just like going back into the past.",
          "Our day in Avignon was so filled with other tours that we were unable to visit the bridge. Fortunately, our riverboat did an illumination pass-by after dark. We were able to see the four remaining arches. From its completion in 1185, until the 17th century, the bridge was",
          "Officially known as Pont Saint Benezet, the medieval bridge goes across the river Rhone. It was built between 1177 and 1185. The bridge was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by King Louis VIII. The rebuilt bridge was made with stones and included 22 arches. During the flood,",
          "Get information on the bridge prior to the visit to understand why the bridge was built. Do not use the nursery rhyme as background information.",
          "I think visiting the Pont D\u2019Avignon is a must if you are familiar with the nursery rhyme. You have to pay in order to walk on the bridge and that includes an audio guide that gives the background about the bridge. Make sure to go to the lower level to watch the simulation videos",
          "An interesting place to visit for French people because of the infamous pont d\u2019Avignon song, but frankly nothing that interesting to see.",
          "Worth the visit but if you're short on time, then looking at it may suffice. Whilst I did enjoy it, the audio was really ordinary & a let down after the advances in audiovisual tech that we had experienced at othet historical sites.",
          "It's an interesting ruin of a bridge system -- actually several bridges, of which only part of the span survives. Interesting to understand how it was constructed, and how it failed. We stood at the end of the bridge and watched debris carried by the Rhone at spring flood fly",
          "The bridge has an interesting history and saw some venerable travellers in the past. Unfortunately the engineers just could not keep it standing against adverse currents and weather so we can only imagine the full crossing. Good audio guide.",
          "Yes, this bridge does end in the middle of the river. It is really lovely and worthy visiting. You have a nice view, can take pictures...I believe though it must be crowded in the summer. But Avignon is famous for this bridge, so do not hesitate to go there.",
          "Interesting history and a scenic bridge, so well known that you must see it if you are close. Take the included audio tour.",
          "Very good photo ops with views all around, price for entry is not too steep for the photo ops once on the bridge, there are a few sites of interest on the pont.",
          "We set off with our audio guides and enjoyed our visit enormously. Very interesting information provided and a happy hour spent exploring the bridge and its history. And lots of photos of us on the bridge for our grandchildren. We bought a combined ticket for the bridge and",
          "I\u2019m pleased I did it, but ultimately, it\u2019s half a bridge! I got a joint ticket with the Palais des Papes at a reduced rate. The audioguide for the bridge has very good information, but it\u2019s not always clear when to advance it. The bridge does give great views up and down the",
          "By walking out to the banks of the River Rh\u00f4ne you can see the remains of the bridge and have no need to pay unless you want to walk across.",
          "Lot of cool history and architecture in town. Take a few minutes to check this out. Go see the Popes palace too.",
          "Five euros to go on the bridge. Worth it for the lovely view of the river. Easy to walk on and views of Avignon as well.",
          "As others have said, it's a bridge, and only a partial bridge at that, however it is steeped in history and if you don't have to wait in line, worth the visit.",
          "Well ... it's a bridge. The admission was included in the Pope's Palace ticket. The walk there was very nice, but the bridge itself is just a bridge.The audio guide helped understand some of the history.",
          "The historical information and computer wizardry at this site is so interesting. Headphones are included. It is definitely worth a visit.",
          "During our visit to Avignon we just had to \"do\" the famous Bridge. The entrance is around the rear of the adjoining building and an easy walk from the Palais de Papes and adjoining pedestrian areas Worth a walk if only for the history",
          "We weren\u2019t sure whether we should spend our precious time touring this bridge. We are so very glad we did!!! It is truly an amazing feat of engineering with a rich history. The displays, films and narratives are well done and well worth the inexpensive $5EU per person.",
          "We paid for this ticket alongside the Palais du Popes as part of a package deal, hence felt a bit obligated to come.. ended up a bit of a disappointment as there really isn\u2019t much to see. Certainly a lovely view from the bridge itself but it\u2019s probably not worth prioritising",
          "The bridge is not special. It became famous because of a song in a 19th century operetta. I understand that it's difficult to visit Avignon without going on the Pont d'Avignon. But going on it will not enhance your experience of this fantastic town.",
          "A good overview of city history, the historical importance of the bridge, architecture and construction, and reasons for its ultimate demise. Worth the investment.",
          "This is the famous ruined bridge of the children's song. It is just a short stroll from the Pope's Palace, and is on a combo ticket if you visit the Palace. If you are in Avignon it is worth a visit.",
          "We only had one day in Avignon but I think we made the most out of it. The Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet is a really beautiful sight, worth the visit.",
          "Really good audio guide for this bridge that explores what they believe happened with the bridge to begin with. Highly recommend.",
          "Having been familiar with the famous song for many years it was great to walk along the bridge. The audio guide was very good.",
          "What is left of the bridge (4 arches from original 21) is worth a visit and a walk across. There audio tour gives a lot of background to the history of the bridge.",
          "Having read about the history and the nursery rhyme, plus it was part of our ticket, we decided to visit. It won\u2019t take long and although cold, we walked to the end. Your get good views back to the Palais de Popes and centre of Avignon. There is also an interesting display on",
          "The Pont d'Avignon is a great activity if you need to waste some time while in Avignon. I enjoyed looking at the Pont from Rocher des Doms more than I enjoyed being on the actual Pont. It was a well organized and informative experience though, and takes less than an hour to",
          "At the entrance (charge) you are given a free audio guide, it is very informative. The tour tskes you out on to the bridge. It is great to see the locals singing the song associated with the bridge, made it more appealing. Tour time is only about 45 mins unless you listen to",
          "Who has not heard of this famous bridge. Wrongly sang as \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" this is a French song about the Pont d'Avignon that dates back to the 15th century. It actually has its own name, \"Pont St. B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\" but it is better known as the Pont d'Avignon because of its city",
          "Interesting information presented. A visit that was worth the time. Learnt so much about the Pont and the Rhone River.",
          "Saint Benezet heard God\u2019s voice telling him to build the bridge. I on the other hand heard all those songs about people dancing on the bridge so driven by curiosity went there to find out more. Well, it\u2019s just a nice bridge with a nice view.",
          "This is of course a famous bridge in song but although slightly interesting is better viewed from below or even better above from the Rocher des Doms (a park situated on the hill above the Popes Palace). Slightly surprised to hear some people complain that the bridge didn't go",
          "The entrance to the site catches you by surprise and was not very busy when we visited. Access was quite easy and use of the audio commentary was simple to understand. The walk through is good and the short audiovisual showing the work of a team of experts putting together the",
          "As a small child in Belgium we learned to sing this song. It was great to finally be able to sing it on the bridge itself, after more than 40 years. The location is beautiful and has much history.",
          "Fun to connect a childhood song with the actual bridge and its history - located just opposite the Palais Des Papes and outside the medieval walls / small entrance fee/ museum on site / takes about an hour. Four arches remain but Pont St.-Benezet once boasted 22 arches",
          "The best view of the bridge and the city are from the other side of the Rhone. It\u2019s an easy walk across Pont Daladier where you can stroll along the promenade taking in the bridge and the city for free. It\u2019s a nice spot to have lunch. There is plenty of seating and it\u2019s very",
          "Historical bridge, beautiful scenery and stonework. Very windy on day of visit, take care near the edge.",
          "The bridge is iconic and worth the trouble if only for The photographic opportunities it gives. After passing through security, we were given the complimentary audio tour. This was a basic audio tour and although very interesting, taking it immediately after the Palais des",
          "Joins the list of many other bridges (Tower, Brooklyn, Sydney Harbour, Vecchio etc.) that have captured the worlds collective imagination but sadly doesn't go that far ? Well worth a stroll over what's left and gaze into the fast flowing Rhone !",
          "See great views of Avignon and the Rhone. Have a look inside the tiny chapel. If you don\u2019t want to walk on it, see it from the streets or from above in Rocher des Doms. Just don\u2019t miss this lovely little historic bridge. For me, it was worth the \u20ac5 admission.",
          "Interesting history. Nice place to visit. Plan to spend about an hour there. Located close to the heart of the city.",
          "Our ship was just south of this site. It is known all over Europe. You don't need a guide. Most people go up there and take a picture or have a picture taken of them at the bridge. You would probably only spend 15 minutes or so at most.",
          "Quite a nice preserved part of the history of the area. The audio guide is quite amusing. Worth an hour stop. Apparently in times long past Avignon and Edinburgh had a lot in common\u201dold reeky!\u201d",
          "This bridge is visible from various locations around Avignon. As it is a ruin you can only walk out so far then back again. It is not an attraction that you have to \"do\" just something to see in my opinion.",
          "Interesting what remains of the bridge. It's famous through a French medieval children's song that I couldn't possibly sing. You can visit it but we just chose to view it from the riverbanks.",
          "Our river cruise took us up to the Pont to see it from the water. It and the town of Avignon are best seen this way as you have a view of many of the buildings you have seen on a land tour. Taken together it is a different feeling.",
          "This beautiful medieval period bridge is world famous and part of its fame is due to the catchy children's song and nursery rhyme, 'Sur le pont d'Avignon', a 15th century ditty of people dancing on the bridge. The bridge itself is 12th century. Our guide described the",
          "Obviously, if staying or even visiting Avignon, one must go to the famous bridge. Although it doesn't actually cross the river it is a great place for photographs and just to say that one has been. The audio guides are very good andtyhe views around excellent.",
          "This site can be visited by combining the ticket with the ticket from the Palais des Papes for a discount. The bridge was built in the early 1200s and the legend makes the story behind it quite interesting. The audioguide is once again included in the ticket price which makes",
          "One of the main attractions of Avignon, the bridge that leads to nowhere. There's an entrance fee but at least you get an audio guide. You can buy a combined ticket valid also for Papal palace. Experience a nice view of the bridge and river from the park Rocher de sons.",
          "The views of the Rh\u00f4ne river and this bridge are fantastic!! Take the opportunity to take great pictures too!!",
          "Well, you can dance on it if you want! No-one minds and I saw one or two people doing so slightly sheepishly, but isn't that what being a tourist is all about? Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought \u20ac5 was a fair price for entry, especially as it includes a very informative",
          "A very interesting av presentation makes a visit to this monument worthwhile. It describes the history and architecture of the bridge very well. In terms of a worthwhile visit - you get much better views from the bank.",
          "A visit is appreciated by many who sung the song as kids. Others who will enjoy it are technology and history buffs - if you read the signs and follow the audioguide you get excellent background on the constructin and just how impressive it was at the time. Some cities built",
          "I think the title says it all but maybe I'm just a grumpy old man (my wife agrees with that!). After having walked up to the observation point above the river, which offers stunning views, taken photo's of the bridge, and then walked down some ancient winding staircases, to then",
          "The audio was very detailed and I listened to very little of it after the first couple of stops, although the different treatments of the song were worth a listen. The bridge spans part of the Rhone but is not complete and does not particularly stand out from other old bridges.",
          "If like us you visited the Papal Palace before visiting Pont d\u2019Avignon your feet are likely achingly this point. But take a break for something to eat as you\u2019re in for more walking. But it\u2019s all worth the effort! We proceeded across the bridge parallel to Pont d\u2019Avignon (just",
          "We walked the bridge, danced the dance, sang the song and took the photos of this beautiful part bridge. In many ways it's only possible to appreciate this extraordinary bridge if you have some knowledge of its history so its well worth taking the time to enjoy the info panels",
          "Worth a visit. We watched the video in the downstairs area explaining how they are tracking the bridge's origin and history and it was very informative. For those who know the nursery rhyme associated with this bridge, you will be singing it for days afterward",
          "Beautiful little walk on the old bridge in sunny weather. Watched the tourist river sightseeing boat arrive, playing the song \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\". Nice experience being part of this meeting in the middle of the beautiful Rh\u00f4ne River.",
          "Could not come this far and not visit the brisge of the childhood song. Sang he song and danced on the bridge on a beautiful day the views were amazing.",
          "Beautiful & historic bridge in Avignon. Worth the views. Truly unfortunate that the bridge was not maintained so half of it collapsed over the decades.",
          "We was going to pay to enter to go to view the pont saint benezet but we decided against it after realising that literally all you are paying to do is walk across it. We decided to walk along the main road and see the bridge from there instead as you get to see the architecture",
          "We did this tour as part of a package with the visit to the Papal Palace. It was worth doing and provided some insight to the history of the Rh\u00f4ne river as well as the bridge itself.",
          "I'm not sure what the big deal is about this broken bridge is. We watched the video which went into elaborate detail about how they built the bridge and the caisson structure, etc. but the point is, it collapsed. It was unable to stand the pressure. Some of that had to do with",
          "Visited this bridge. wonderful chapples built into the bidge. great views of the city from the bridge",
          "No need to buy a ticket. Can watch from the street and take a photo. The ticket lets you walk on it which is kind of a waste as you can't see it while on it...",
          "Although you can see the bridge clearly from the green space by the main thoroughfare and probably manage to take a picture without any traffic I think the best view is from the gardens (Rocher des Doms) higher up past the Palais de Papes. If you pick up a city map the view",
          "Avignon is a very beautiful place in France. The bridge is known for a children song and it is stunning. There is no tour guide, only an audio guide and it is best to go on summer since the view is really amazing. Avignon is a small little town but full of wonders.",
          "The bridge is old but still looking good. Don't miss your time to go on it and take some nice pictures of the sunset. It is a good place to enjoy some fresh air.",
          "Take the audio tour which is a combined price with the Palais de popes. It adds so much to history of the time period and region.",
          "Very interesting bridge and used to be a way into Avignon. If you don't read French you need to have an audio guide",
          "This bridge casts many interesting thoughts about history, wealth, waste and just about the curiosities of life. It must be visited and stand on the edge in the middle of the river. A bridge for philosophers.",
          "Famous bridge of a French song, I have seen it three times and keep coming back just for the pictures.",
          "Highly recommend that the audio-guide tour be taken so that you get the complete story and history of the Bridge. Very enjoyable and relaxing walk with amazing views of The Rh\u00f4ne and Avignon. Sing the song and do the dance. Combine your visit with the Pope\u2019s Palace.",
          "Thank goodness it was cooler here than the rest of Provence. What can I say- you have to go. Do a little dance and enjoy the view.",
          "Not much except the few remaining arches of a once important bridge over the Rhone. I didnt walk on it this time around. There's a pretty view of it from the gardens next to the church and papal palace.",
          "It is not common that you can walk freely into the middle of a river. Try it if you wanted. I didn't. I do find the view from Rocher des Doms is best to see this bridge. It does take some efforts to hike up the garden; but you will enjoy the views of the bridge and others.",
          "A famous French song says that the people dance on this bridge in Avignon. Perhaps it is because it is only half a bridge across a river with such strong currents the rest of the bridge collapsed and now one sees only the half located outside the Palais des Papes. It is a lovely",
          "This famous historic bridge now stretches only half way across the river Rhone having been swept away by the many floods of earlier days before the Rhone was tamed by locks and barrages. It is popular with tourists but really there is not much to see. It is some distance from",
          "Multilingual commentary made the most of the experience. Interesting to see how research had uncovered the history and separated fact from legend.",
          "Small piece of the original bridge left. Nothing special under any point of view. A lot of advertising due to the famous song and French hymn, but really nothing special.",
          "Used our ticket from the Palais de Papes to walk on to the Pont D'Avignon. Lift up to the bridge not working but the effort of climbing was worthwhile. You can't be in Avignon and not walk on that bridge.",
          "If it wasnt for the famous song and doing your own little \"dance sur le pont d'Avignon\", you wouldnt really miss much. With the exception of the nice view on the river and city - and the fact that the bridge has never been finished... it's still somehow a must do when you're",
          "This was worth the visit - you are walking on history. The information regarding the building of the bridge was interesting and just looking at its structure and the river flowing was great plus lots of fish swimming around too! Also has a lovely view back to city too.",
          "A historic bridge with lasting arches half way across the river, the rest was swept away. An archaeological project has established the building techniques and recreated the structure in a video. We enjoyed the audio guide which was informative without being boring, \u20ac5 entrance",
          "Beautiful Bridge destroyed partially by fire in 1860. Very peaceful river flowing through, lovely setting",
          "Must admit was slightly disappointed with my visit here. Extremely windy and not a lot of signs showing its history. We missed out of using the audio translator was may have got more out of it. Great photo ops to say you've been there!",
          "But really no sense to buy a ticket, just walk by. If you are deeply interested in history then pay for combined ticket with palace of popes. There are audio guides to walk around with.",
          "Paid 5 euros each to visit the bridge. Not a lot to see although we can say we were ' sur Le pont d'Avignon '",
          "The Pont Saint-Benezet and the associated fort / wall was one of our favorite sights in Avignon. The top of the bridge is a great vantage point to watch the river traffic and activities across the other side. Make sure you drop down on the bridge to see the chapel, Chapelle",
          "Its history and reputation make it a place to see but actually it is just half a bridge, you walk to the end and you walk back. Great views of the river though",
          "There is No point visiting Avignon if not seeing the Bridge. Indeed i did as I intended and walked on it out to the middle of the river. I did a little dance as per the famous song \"Sur le pont d'Avignon\" Mind you the song is wrong as the dancing did not take place on the bridge",
          "The song makes this place an icon and it is really worth visiting. There are some excellent presentations by film and posters giving a full detailed history about St Benezet and the construction of the bridge. The strategic importance of Avignon is pointed out in fine detail and",
          "This is THE reason to visit Avignon. To have a little jiggle on the bridge is something to be done ever sice learning about it at school - too many years ago now! The automated commentary you get from the handsets is quite informative and I actually learnt a few things I didn't",
          "Yes, we could see the bridge without paying to go on it. But I'm so glad we paid and did this. There's a very interesting and well put together museum about the bridge's construction and why it collapsed and could not be rebuilt. It was also great to get the legend and history",
          "Spent about an hour here, there's a short audio-guide tour which is good, and a small exhibition detailing the history of the bridge.",
          "Avignon old city is worth a visit but it's two top attractions were less appealing (to me). The popes palace is architecturally interesting but the building is empty and the audio guide uninspiring. The deal price to see the bridge and the palace seems good but in truth I think",
          "Everybody knows the french song: Sur le pont d'Avignon, on y danse ...\" , but you have to walk over the remaining arches of one of the longest bridges of the middle ages. A charmfull chapel is located on one pillar, and stairs give nice perspective views all around the place.",
          "The most famous attraction in Avignon and a nice place to take a few photos of the river / town. Entry costs a few euros (but can also be bought as a combination ticket with the Popes' Palace, which is far better value) which includes entry to the bridge itself and also to a",
          "Would you visit this bridge if it went right across the river to the other side? Don't know. Historically interesting and gave all the legends of how the bridge may have been built across the Rhone. Includes the little chapel within the bridge. The entry price includes audio",
          "I learned the French song \"Sur le pont d'Avignon\" when I was in grade 1 and I had no idea until recently that the song sings about a real bridge in Avignon. This is really the only reason I find this bridge cool, other than the fact that it is a super old one. I wouldn't",
          "This is the Famous bridge that the song was written about so is a must do if in the area. The bridge is only small as it does not go all the way over the river and you have to pay for the privilege to walk on the bridge. Great photo opportunities from the roadway to take home to",
          "What a marvelous history this bridge has. Saint Benezet - either a raving mad shepherd or an entrepreneurial genius. The story is intriguing. The view fantastic.",
          "It's what you do when you come to Avignon. It was interesting enough, paying 2 Euro's for the audio guide was worth it, may have been a bit sterile without it.",
          "Had a good wander around. Make sure you visit the information section and view the video. Lots of information on what the bridge was originally like.",
          "A bit of a disappointment after all the hype. Interesting enough for a quick visit and a few snapshots. Brings to mind the kids rhyme we all learned a school.",
          "This is nice thirty minute excursion, which you should do in conjunction with a visit to the palace of the popes. In fact, buy the joint ticket, and use the excellent audio guide.",
          "This is a nice area in Avignon and definitely worth visiting. The pont is quite small and not very impressive, but go there anyway if you are in the neighbourhood.",
          "The bridge is visible without a cost but the tour is worthwhile and get the audio guide and share it between a few people The history is interesting and one only needs to have read KEn follets \"pillars of the earth\" to appreciate its pretty hard to have built bridges in the",
          "If you ride the little train from the popes palace they will drive you by this bridge. It has a lot of history that is interesting but not necessary to walk on it.",
          "If you are going to visit here, definitely do the combined ticket with Palais des Papes. There is easy access to the bridge via Rocher des Doms, another great place to visit. While the bridge is no longer fully intact, it is still cool to walk on and provides a unique view of",
          "Well worth a visit! Pretty views and a nice wander, with interesting French history. Lovely view of the Rhone.",
          "Again a really good audioguide, a surprising amount to see. Good idea to combine with entry to other attractions",
          "Most people don't know that the song was originally \"Sous le Pont d'Avignon\", that is Under, not On the bridge. But the Pont Benezet is still a must-see, whether you dance on it or under it.",
          "Two adults and two teenage girls visited in August 2017. Worth an hour or so on this half-a-bridge which sticks out into the Rhone. Gives you a lovely view of the river. We used the free audio guide which was very useful. A nice little trip on a sunny day",
          "A combined ticket with the Palais is an excellent combination and provides an opportunity to stroll across what is now half a bridge. The view of the palace and its surroundings is worth the 10 minute walk to get to the bridge.",
          "the bridge itself looks good but the visit it's a non-sense. it's cheap and you get to walk on the bidge and see a little movie about its history, less than 20 minutes overall. I don't think it's worth, this one should be free.",
          "I don't recall if it was free, but you must get the audio guide for this short tour because it's quite helpful to tell the legacy of the bridge. It was much narrower than I was expecting. Connected to the Pope's Palace grounds.",
          "There's not a huge amount to see, but there is an interesting film about the attempts by archaeologists to understand how the bridge had been build originally. Unfortunately, you have to stand or sit in a rather smelly little underground room to see it. Nice view from the bridge",
          "It was a warm sunny day and the atmosphere was superb. We walked down through the narrow streets from the town centre; the air was full of the scent of lavender from the many shops selling every derivative of the plant; then a short walk along the river bank and there it was.",
          "Having spent part of my childhood singing about it, I was looking forward to this. There are only 2 or 3 arches to it and it was such a disappointment. I understand that when it was built it was a magnificent bridge but so much has now collapsed it is not worth the detour!",
          "After the palace it is the next place to visit (as the ticket is easier to buy for 2 places). Opens a nice view to the river and palace architecture but more beautiful to watch it from distance.",
          "Visited on a Sunday late afternoon. Summer light on the bridge was beautiful. You start first with the tower where people arrived from the bridge. Plenty of written explanations, then downstairs you have 2 videos done recently explaining the work of a few scientist to explain",
          "Really worth \u20ac5 for the experience. Great location for photos and the pleasure of telling friends I had danses on the bridge.",
          "We came here end of afternoon and bought the combined ticket for Pope Palace. It was actually a very good idea. So the next day, you can go to Pope Palace and avoid the queue! It was a very good time to visit the Pont in the afternoon, not too hot, a bit of wind...",
          "We had purchased a combined ticket for this and the Palais des Papes which was better value than buying individually. We walked out across the bridge into the middle of the Rhone which afforded good views of the Palais. Worth going just to say we'd bee \"sur le pont d'Avignon\"",
          "The bridge is attractive and, I suppose, a must-do feature of a visit to the city, but not hugely exciting! The chapel in the miiddle is interesting, and there are some fine views from the bridge.",
          "Even going with children showing them the beauty of this famous bridge over the rhone river , is a nice , interesting attraction .it permits you after going into old avignon streets which is a great visit.if you come during summer season then it becomes even greater with so many",
          "Interesting if you are into history,you can walk along this and get a good view of the city.Some river cruises take you along to it.",
          "A little taste of history on a sunny day. The film explaining the 3D reconstruction is fascinating and worth watching.",
          "This is best viewed from the grass bank opposite the old city. There are boat tours (although we didn't take one) but I would expect the view from the bank to be just as good.",
          "Interesting site if you're in Avignon. I believe there is a song about it - sorry I didn't realize this didn't post when I was originally there in 2009",
          "An old bridge, which is half-demolished, and now only reaches the middle of the river. Tickets for access to the bridge are expensive.",
          "Because it was there? The 12th century bridge is a landmark of Avignon, and to some of us, a must cross, even it is ends half-way across the Rhone. There is interpretive information as you enter the gate of the bridge, and a small chapel half-way across. At the end of the",
          "We were on a river cruise and moored about 500 meters from the bridge. It once spanned both arms of the river but now just the one arm which is smaller. It has been restored and you can visit it.Very pretty and a place where in the past centuries the locals used to sing and",
          "an unfinished bridge .. .beautiful under the city lights . . . but nothing unsual or extraordinary .",
          "This Midieval bribge dates back to 11th century. Standing majestically across the Rhone river. The beautiful bridge and the rivers is very mesmerizing. There is a ferry to cross the river for free.",
          "After visiting the popes palace this was excellent grand finale! Standing in the warm wind with the river running underneath looking back at the great view of Avignon will be a memory forever.",
          "Well, we've ticked it off our 'to do' and 'to see before we die' lists, but it was a bit of an anticlimax. Yes, it's lovely; yes, it's impressive (to a point); yes, it must have been amazing when complete, but it's not that impressive compared to the Ponte Vecchio, for example.",
          "You have to do the walk along the bridge and do a little dance!! Then you can sing the song \"sur le pont d'Avignon\"....everyone does sing the song!",
          "Do not pay to money to get on the bridge or if you do make sure you have a discount brochure. Picture best taken across the street on the grass next to the road.",
          "Not much to see but if you like history then it's interesting. You can imagine what it might have been like and understand better why it put Avignon on the map in the late middle-ages.",
          "One of the best known attractions anywhere, this has a fascinating history. However, be sure to collect the audio guide at the ticket desk. These have no additional charge and give a real depth to the visit, but were not offered by the ticket staff!",
          "Last time we only looked at it from the bank but this time we went on it and it's definitely worth it. Only cost about \u20ac5 and the views back at Avignon and down the river were really good. Also there is a chapel on the bridge which you don't see from the bank.",
          "Fame and architectural merit makes the bridge worth a visit. It has great views of both the river and the fortified city (the only intact one in France). Shares a duel ticket for the palace as well.",
          "The Avignon bridge looks good and you can see Rhone River below it. From the street you can see the reflection of the bridge to the river and it looks beautiful.",
          "It is well worth walking out on the bridge to see the view of the city. Make sure you take the audio guide.",
          "You can not go to Avignon without visiting this famous pont. The area around the river is very pleasant, it is a fair walk through the side streets so wear comfortable footwear.",
          "I appreciate that quite a while ago old things weren't seen as worth preserving and humanity pulled them down and put up something 'new'. The destruction of the majority of this bridge is a real pity, bit its also what makes it different to other bridges. You get some great",
          "All I knew about this bridge was the song .... I can now say I've walked along what is left of it! Not a lot to see (apart from the beautiful views of the river) but the displays are very informative, explaining how the bridge was initially built - an amazing feat in itself.",
          "This was on my must see list as it brought back memories of the first bit of French I learned at primary school singing the song \"Sur le pont d'avignon\" Good audio guide in your chosen language included with entry price. Lovely views of the river Rhone and not ridiculously",
          "The bridge itself is a easily visited and doesn't take that long. The movie that is shown was interesting in that it showed how it was built and speculation on why it didn't last. It was nice that it was part of a combo ticket to the Pope's Palace, otherwise, I might have",
          "What a worthwhile stop...one of the reasons we came to Avignon. We got the ticket when we went to the Palais - an extra few EU's but worth it! Took about 10 mins to walk there from Palais du Pape and about 30 mins max for audio tour and pictures. Loved it!!",
          "Nice spot to view the Rhone river. You walk over the river on the bridge but it stops about 2/3's of the way which is kind of cool. I didn't bother with the audio guide but people seemed interested.",
          "The information support around the entrance doesn't really enhance this unremarkable experience. So, this is really one of those things one just wants to check off their bucket list. I would add that 5 Euros is a little bit steep (you could walk to the end of the bridge and back",
          "I loved going onto this wonderful old bridge. It was better than expected. The only drawback was getting onto the bridge. I am not a spring chicken, I was quite tired and really did not want to confront another set of stairs and to my delight I spotted an elevator (lift).",
          "Basically an old bridge which stops halfway across the river Rh\u00f4ne. Glad I can say I've done it but not that amazing",
          "You can visit the bridge as part of a double ticket with the Palace Des Papes. The is a lot of information to help you understand what, when and how the bridge was built. This includes the legend as well as the practical information. You don't need long here but well worth it.",
          "Definitely worth paying for a walk along the 'bridge'. Interesting both architecturally and historically. A number of photo opportunities will present themselves on your stroll.",
          "Avignon is pretty, giving you the feeling of authentic France. This medieval bridge crosses the river (well almost) which separates the old & new parts of the town!",
          "The bridge was nice, but not worth paying the ticket price to go up. Not much of a view although the bridge itself is beautiful. Note that the \"railings\" atop the bridge have giant spaces and it made me very nervous with children. Be careful!",
          "We didn't know about the song, although the audio guide does mention it. We were at the end of the bridge when we heard a couple singing - it was the famous song which they translated into English for us and gave us a history of this nursery rhyme - really made the trip. The",
          "You can not visit Avignon without a stroll on this famous bridge! The view of the river is breathtaking! For anyone (like us) who studied French in school this is a part of our educational history. To be on this bridge and sing its well known song was a moving experience for me.",
          "Well worth visit as ties in with Papal Palace ticket and info provided is very thorough in the way it explains history",
          "You won't be missing much if you don't walk on the bridge. Save your time & money because it's nothing life-changing.",
          "Anyone that study in a French school around the world , must remember that song Sur le Pont d'Avignon On y danse, On y danse Sur le Pont d'Avignon On y danse tous en rond The bridge over the Rh\u00f4ne river in Avignon was built in the 12TH century . Is formal name is Pont St.",
          "Sometimes I wonder if it wasn't for the famous French song about this bridge, would anyone care to pay a visit to this town at all? I've seen more impressive bridges all over the world and as a whole Avignon is an unimpressive place. If you ever pass through it, plan for no more",
          "The bridge is not that spectacular, the river is. Like a beast, giving and taking with the enormous flow of water. The movie is the true eye-opener if one has the slightest interest in the history of this \"bridge\".",
          "The bridge was built between 1177 and 1185. It was built across islands in the river and originally had about 23 arches. The Rh\u00f4ne is prone to flooding and over the centuries parts of the bridge have been washed away. There are only four arches remaining. You can pay to walk on",
          "Having heard about the Pont d'Avignon (and sung the song!) for decades, in reality it was disappointing. Stretching halfway across the River Rhone, the architecture is interesting from the river bank; paying and going on to the bridge is pointless, you can't see it. We",
          "There is no doubting the fact that this bridge is famous but here's the thing; when you are on it, you can't really see it. So save yourself the entry fee, take the free ferry across the Rhone and walk downstream. From there you get a brilliant view.",
          "The only reason to go onto the bridge is to be able to say you danced on the Pont d'Avignon. It's prettier from the ground.",
          "If you are in Avignon, surely you want to go on the bridge? Definitely worth doing for the view of the river. Discounted price if over 60.",
          "So many of the sights in Southern France have entry fees. Do not let this deter you. The audio one listens to as you walk on the bridge provides more interesting and pertinent history of the city and the popes.",
          "The audio guide is a must to view this bridge. Historically it is significant but there is not much to see. The view up and down the Rhone is nice. When you think about Avignon as a city 1,000 after the Romans left there it is pretty mind boggling. I liked walking on the city",
          "10\u20ac for two, not great value. Not that interesting really. It's better to look at than be on. There really isn't a great deal to say about it",
          "Since you are in Avignon, you should definitely visit this bridge. Not the most exciting place but interesting and you get to learn some history of the place. Take some cool photos too.",
          "Of course you know the song: Sur le pont .... Now come and see it, walk across the surviving arches, and enjoy the audio guide which is free. The only downside - every other visitor to the city wants to come here too, so it may be crowded.",
          "This is a really interesting piece of Avignon's history. Audio guides for a number of languages are available (included in ticket price) and this gives you a lot of information about the bridge. I would also recommended going to see details of the 3D modelling of what the",
          "During my visit to Avignon we considered visiting the famous bridge. Maybe cheekily they now charge to go on the bridge-just to walk half-way across the river. Since we wanted to see the bridge we just walked along the riverside and could see and photograph it nicely. You cannot",
          "It was very interesting to walk out on the bridge to the middle of the Rhone River. There was a small museum on the bridge that explained some of the history of the bridge. It is worth the time to see.",
          "A beautiful sight and a reminder that nature is stronger than anything man has created. The river Rhone has torn down quite a fiew bridges along its way, this one of course being the most beautiful and the oldest. We could see crouds of people walking on the bridge to the point",
          "This is a well know tourist site - the Saint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet Bridge (popularly known as the \"pont d'Avignon). There is little left of the original bridge but it still is a must-see site. Standing at the end of the bridge you can get some nice views of the Pope's Palace as well as the",
          "Can combine this visit with Pope's Palace on the same or next day for a reduced admission. Although just a short length of bridge with a couple of chapels, a definite must see when in Avignon.",
          "A fascinating visit, thanks to the audio guide and associated exhibition. The Rhone is beautiful as it meanders past Avignon's majestic walls, the foothills of the Alps in the background. Anyone hoping to cross the river, however, should take another route. This bridge fails to",
          "Interesting and informative visit with the history of the bridge with obligatory nursery rhyme song plus a lovely stroll to the end, make sure you combine the ticket with palaise des papes tickets for the best bargain",
          "Beautiful scenic bridge over the Rhone. Worth the admission where you receive a transmitter to listen to the history of the bridge.",
          "At last we arrived at the Bridge of our nursery rhyme. The wind was around 30 mph so we didn't stay too long. Interesting to see how the Bridge stops short in the water. The river Rhone damaged the Bridge on many occasions. Eventually it was decided not to repair it anymore.",
          "If you're passing through Avignon don't miss the notorious bridge which was the reason for \"Sur Le Pont d'Avignon\" song! It's enough to check it from outside, don't pay a ticket to see it.",
          "Very cute experience if you are one of those who used to sign Sur le pont d'avignon son in their childhood. The tour is short but with audio guide you learn a bit more than the song :) which by the way, has a indie, raggae etc. version.",
          "It's a really nice place, historical and well conserved but we will appreciate much more the view from above the park and outside. If you want to enter you must pay 5\u20ac par person and the view is nothing compared with outside",
          "Thought it would be in a better condition but it's less than a quarter of its length. Not much to sing about Built as a vision by a local boy, it now doesn't function as a bridge. Not worth the visit unless it's incidental.",
          "A must-see visit. Get the combined ticket with the Palace visit. You need to pay to get onto the bridge. It's cheap & well-worth it. Don't forget to sing the song. Everybody sings it!",
          "One of the traditions for the French children is to get to the bridge and do the ring of roses dance and sing \"Sur le pont d'Avignon\". We were there and no one was singing or dancing. Then as we were walking off the bridge a mother took three little boys and started singing and",
          "We did not go on the bridge but watched from below as couples danced on the bridge......delightful in so many ways. For a small fee you can walk on the bridge but it is lovely to view from the ground.",
          "This bridge, the remains of the longer one, is a marvellous place to stroll up and down, its very photogenic and you must visit the chapel",
          "Is due to the song we sang at junior school...sur Le point d'Avignon. Well here it is and great to see. No need to walk it really (fee involved). Gets busy and towns bipass runs alongside so watch out when crossing roads (use crossing). The town is also worth a visit, I stayed",
          "The bridge is a nice landmark, and I would recommend having a walk close to it: you can take nice pictures!",
          "The best thing about this bridge is the well known French song \"Sur le pont d\u2019Avignon\". The bridge itself is nothing special, really! They charge you to enter the bridge but when you pay you would be disappointed, the best thing you cold do is to look from the distance.",
          "Don't get me wrong: you should go walk over the bridge for sure. But the bridge itself, from distance, offers a much better picture and views than the ones you will get walking over it. Be advised: you will see lots (and I mean LOTS and LOTS) of mosquitoes in some points of the",
          "It was great to see this bridge during the off season - we had it to ourselves and we had a better view because of the lack of trees/leaves along the water's edge. Of course we danced on the bridge, even though history says they didn't! Recommend buying the combined",
          "Worth the visit no matter what the weather, there is an information area inside that is very informative",
          "Interesting points on audio guided tour. Allow at least 30 minutes to view and hear self-guided audio presentation.",
          "There is saying that Paris is not France, and it could not be true and then when you travel through Provence south towards the Italian border. So many points of interest to see along the way and Avignon is marvellous",
          "A tour of the Pont Benezet (it's official name) will not take you longer than 30 minutes. The audio guide is key in understanding the history of the bridge and does a good job at entertaining while being factual. Tips: - Buy a combo ticket with the Palais des Papes. - there's",
          "Definitely worth a quick walk from the Palais Des Papes. Beautiful against the backdrop of the river. Quiet and not crowded.",
          "Its a lovely bridge, full of history and stories behind it, the pictures are great. Bad thing is they charge a fee to enter, i didnt pay, stayed outisde",
          "Medieval bridge with a great glimpse at the architecture and engineering of the time. Recs for a combo ticket.",
          "Loved it, took it in as part of our Palais De Popes tour and it is a must do. You can \"see\" it from Rocher des Doms and from the outside of the Avignon wall but it is worth it to walk it and marvel at what an achievement it was in medieval times. The climatic changes at the",
          "Interesting history and short trip, 30-40 minutes would suffice. Recommend to do if your in Avignon, wouldn't come here for that purpose though",
          "We enjoyed dancing on this famous bridge and had good views up and down the river. Not sure it was worth the price of admission. Probably best to find a multi-site ticket.",
          "My wife and I have visited many times and this year we took my in laws to enjoy a week in Provence. We ended our terrific day with our visit here and it was extraordinary as always. Enjoying the beautiful scenery and history associated with the area is amazing and worth making a",

          "Brought me back to my childhood singing and dancing. The views from all around are majestic. The river, the Papal palace, the castles....all of it was simply beautiful.",
          "One of the must-see spots in Avignon. The historical information in the self-guided audio tour is worth the price of admission. The views of and from the bridge are spectacular.",
          "Well who doesn't want to see a bridge built by a shepherd boy who was told by the disembodied voice of Jesus Christ to build it? Especially after he had to perform the miracle of moving a Giant stone from the Church yard that nobody else could move and use it as the first block",
          "Interestingly I found this fascinating . Not for it's architectural features but for its history and how one person's \"visions\" could persuade people to build such structures.",
          "The bridge is a very interesting structure. Do not miss the 10 minute film with English subtitles, which describes the history of the bridge and all the scientific research that went into understanding how it was constructed and why it collapsed in the middle. You can get some",
          "The Pont d'Avignon is very known by the french song, and so we want to make a walk over this bridge; it's an old bridge, with many niches under the bridge; it's dedicated to San Benezet; I don't know if it is San Benedict; I think the bridge was constructed with the pope's",
          "not a lot to see really - they make a lot out of something that's not got a lot other than the song ! Glad I wentr there but not sure its worth the money",
          "We actually weren't planning to walk out on the bridge but the family pass combo tickets to the Palace of the Popes and the Bridge didn't cost more than a few euros more than to just see the Palace so we figured why not just do both. If you were really short on time and missed",
          "I didn't actually feel the need to go on to the bridge but it was sure a nice piece in my photos you can walk down from the hill above down part of the wall and get great views from above and down by the river.",
          "Despite, transport strikes in France, we were fortunate that the train we had previously booked to Avignon from Nice, was running. The journey is just over three hours, and the train runs along the Cote de Azur for most of the journey, so one gets tantalising glimpses of",
          "We picked up some bread, cheese, and tomato and enjoyed a lovely lunch in the chairs along this famous bridge. Gorgeous sights and we found the audio guide interesting!",
          "What a view a part bridge ! Not finished but part of a wonderful culture and a place of plenty to see ..... very enjoyable and lovely to see and experience the history of France.",
          "Made famous by the song, visiting the actual Pond d'Avignon is a must when coming to the city. The visit is very interesting with a good museum and tour. Well worth the time and money.",
          "A great story about this bride from a our guide. It was originally 22 arches crossing the Rhone river and the island in the middle. The builder heard voices saying to build this bridge, but no one believed this would be done. It was done and survived some many years, then",
          "We were in Marseille in last Christmas and visited this plac alongwith the famous Pont Du Gard. . We took 07-10am train from Marseille St Char and reached at Avigaon Centre station at 8 -18 am. It was 75 mins journey from Marseille rail station and the fare was about \u00a312",
          "Though the bridge is nice, the supporting material on reconstructing what it originally looked like was fascinating.",
          "We got to visit this since it was included in a combi-ticket with the papal palace. The original bridge is washed away a longtime ago. There exists only a partial structure but the audio guide throws up interesting stories and anecdotes to make the trip worthwhile. The",
          "We went to see this as it was on the same ticket as the Pope's palace and a short walk. We enjoyed it but not nearly as much as the palace. It is a nice walk onto the river and the views are nice, but there really isn't all that much to see. I actually appreciated the bridge",
          "Must get the audio, it brings the bridge alive. It will tell you all the historical stories about the bridge!! Best place to take a picture of the bridge is along the river bank. You can cross the river (by car or bus, remember the bridge is washed away in the middle) and see",
          "As part of the combo ticket purchased at Palais de Papes we also visited the Pont Saint-Benezet. You do not have to visit both sites on the same day. We waited for a day with more sun and less wind. Finding the entrance to the bridge provides a bit of a challenge. Situated",
          "The Pont Saint-Benezet or famous Pont d'Avignon is located a shortish walk from the Palais des Papes and apart from the palace is the other reason for visiting Avignon! It is worth paying the small extra charge when going to the Palace as this then includes the bridge (pont)",
          "This medieval bridge is a landmark for Avignon. Spanning the Rh\u00f4ne, it was first built between 1177 and 1185. The arches tended to collapse when the Rh\u00f4ne flooded. In the middle of the 17th century the bridge was abandoned and four arches on the bank of the Rh\u00f4ne remain today.",
          "Beautiful bridge. Excellent view from Rocher des Doms. The cost to walk on the actual bridge will set you back 10 euros per person. We opted to forego this and buy some Lavande Fine at Le Chateau du Bois gift shop close by.",
          "An excellent video explains the history of the bridge of the work that was done to uncover the building of the bridge. The first thing several friends asked was, did you sing the song on the bridge?",

          "After all these years of thinking the children's song was about dancing on the famous bridge in Avignon, we learned that it was dancing under the bridge. Does not change the silliness of the song at all. The best part of the bridge was the spectacular views from the abrupt end.",
          "The best view is at no cost. The park to the right of the museum and behind the Pope's Palace has a few very nice vantage points for the bridge and the Rhone. We also did the audio tour which does a nice job of the history, giving a good summary of the history, especially the",

          "Depending on how interested you are in the history of the bridge would determine whether you'd find it worth paying to visit it or not. You can walk under it freely on the road below, but for a small fee you get access to a small museum about the history of the bridge and you"

          "I enjoyed the historical value. But I am most concerned with safety. It only takes one small move from a child and they chips easily fall through the rails into the water. As a parent I was more consumed with monitoring and surveying my children ensuring their enjoyment over mine.",
          "A must visit when you are around: walking on this iconic bridge. On the bridge you have a nice view of the surroundings while you are listening to the audioguide. The audioguide gets a bit boring after a while though. You have to pay to get access to the bridge.",
          "It was very beautiful for me. We got there just before sunset. So we got to see the beautiful sunset over then bridge and river. I liked the informative, yet captivating information which we got via the audio guide.",
          "Worth a visit. The interpretive materials were nice, and it was fun to walk out on the remains of the bridge and visit the chapel.",
          "Nice place to visit, they also give you an audio guide so you can know the history of the place you are located in. I found that interesting.",
          "The Pont d'Avignon and adjacent Avignon city are a must see for any visitor to the area. We didn't realise that the bridge does not span the Rhone entirely and remains an unfinished but nevertheless impressive structure. Well worth the \u2026",
          "A really beautiful bridge in an extraordinary city of great historical value, it is very beautiful and one should endeavour to fit visiting it into ones schedule when exploring the most beautiful city of Avignon.",
          "The bridge looks great and is well maintained.\nI had emotions for this visit: the reputation of the bridge, the song well known to the children, preceded it.\nIt is not a goal to miss!",
          "This bridge was very cool. In the evenings the reflection of the bridge into the water would make a great photo if you're into photography. Access to yeh bridge closes promptly at 7. I was upset that they stop letting people in around 630 \u2026",
          "The history, the place, the people and how they organized the tourist visits here are so amazing... Surely you gonna enjoy here also.",
          "Once you visit Avignon you will certainly plan a return, its a beautiful in many ways",
          "Pont d'Avignon was really fun to explore, and had excellent views of Avignon near sunset. The cost was reasonable and the audio tour had a lot of interesting information about the city and history of the bridge.",
          "Great historic place.  Highly recommended to visit and learn about it's historical importance.",
          "Beautiful town.Lovely shops,eateries and coffee shops.Loved the Basilica with it's magnificent views and the original Palace of the Pope's.Historical and full of charm.",

          "A charming relic with a story. Good pic opportunity.",

          "Maybe you know the song of the people \"on the Avignon Bridge\". The bridge at issue is the San Benza Bridge, a very well-known bridge in Avignon, built during the Middle Ages between 1177 and 1185 across the River Heron. Originally, the \u2026",

          "it is calm and beautiful places in the city of Avignon. The point of attraction site along the river that we can see stunning landscape from the hill.",
          "No need to pay to join the crowds on the bridge. Just walk down the road that goes through the wall. There's a footpath on the  left side. Get the best  pictures from the river bank.",
          "Great little museum, a must see for anyone who knows the children's song. An film explains why it's not a whole bridge. Very informative.",
          "It was a historical monument, but the admission wasn't really worth it for the experience. The bridge was super crammed with tourists and there isn't much of a view to be had. The museum / exhibit parts of the pont were fairly lacking \u2026",
          "Really nice place, with great tourists information. Free audio guide is only a small part of the great experience",
          "This is of course a must see when visiting Avignon. It doesn\u2019t take that much time to walk around and see the bridge. It wasn\u2019t too pricy to enter either. But I must say I was a bit surprised with the staff being somewhat rude.",
          "Wow! What they built,  with the tools (and slaves) that they had  is amazing.  Well worth a visit.",
          "Great place. Love the view, especially during sun rise and sun set. When the light reflects from the water. Would definitely come back here.",
          "We bought tickets by accident when we visited the palace and nearly didn't bother going. The bridge itself was okay, with nice views. The best part was a video presentation of how the bridge was built. Look for steps to the lower floor, 30m before you enter the bridge.",
          "Magnificent place to visit and see the Pope Palace. Even the river of Rhone provides wonderful view with the panorama of the nature around. If you wouldn\u00b4t visit anything else in Avignon, the bridge is definitely \"a MUST\" for you to visit!!!",
          "One of the best spots in the city, and you can learn the French song while being there...",
          "Even in the pouring rain, it was a most beautiful ancient city worth seeing.",
          "To get on the bridge there's a small fee. Can get crowded at times, but well worth walking the bridge. There's audio guides available for those wishing to know more about the story around the bridge",
          "Unfinished bridge. Nice to visit",
          "It is nice to learn about the history of this place and to see the view from the middle of the river, but the bridge itself is nothing to change your world. It can also be difficult to move around, as the bridge is kind of narrow.",
          "An interesting spot and worth a visit: the bridge has had a number of twists and turns in its past. The only thing to note is that there's a 5\u20acpp entrance fee to get onto the bridge, but you don't find this out until you get to the till - for me, it'd be better if the price was displayed outside...",
          "Beautiful place for sunset views! However please not that you cannot enter the bridge after about 6:45, as it closes at 7pm!",
          "It was good to see it but I was unwilling to spend, what I thought, was quite a lot of money to have my family stand on a bridge.",
          "For me a waste of time, money and energy, tourism hype. Just have a look passing by.",
          "There is an audio guide. Very interesting.\nIf you buy the ticket with Palais des Papes, they give you a discount.",

          "Amazing. Buy combo ticket for both Palais des Papes & Pont D\u2019Avignon. FREE headsets!",

          "Avignon is a wonderful place to visit full of history and charm.",
          "Great to see the remains of the \u201cpont d\u2019avignon\u201d. At the democratic price of 5eur, you get acces to the bridge and the audioguide is included. Provides good insight in the history of the bridge. Worth the small entrance fee.",
          "At some level it is of course just a bridge, and one that doesn't actually serve that purpose as it ends halfway across the river.\nBut there is lot of history here and some interesting information on the city around the time of its \u2026",
          "Another classic not to be missed. Don t forget to sing and dance!",
          "I don\u2019t understand for what we pay 5 eu each!\nOk nice bridge,but to much workers work on this project.Boring & not interesting.And water in river so dirty,brown color.France must to do something about this",
          "Interesting visit good audio guide included in entry fee. Well worth a visit.",
          "Nothing special to do and really not worth the price.",
          "Best place larger version off sarlat nice when shops shut for dinner  Best western plus hotel  excellent  bit out off way good parking  bus out side to town or drive  and free parking in town excellent  food  would stay again 5 star experience and more",
          "It was nice to sing and dance to an old popular childhood song at the end of the bridge, which had collapsed into the river and has never been fixed for hundreds of years",
          "A must-see in the city, but 5\u20ac to enter is definitely too much. Better to enjoy the view on the bridge from the popes garden",
          "This is an interesting bridge with a lot of medieval history situated on the Rhone river.",
          "While it was fun to see the bridge\u2014I think you can get nicer photos from the ground in front then paying for a ticket to actually access the bridge. Seemed quite touristy, but some of the views were nice.",
          "Done of the destinations in the Viking Rhone river cruises. One of the many gems we visited since we started out from Lyon",
          "The bridge is as iconic as the Golden Gate in San Francisco, but the city is wonderful. Great shops, wide choices for cafes, fragrances, art and a Mephisto store to cure your tired feet. Sites, but enjoy the wonderful town.",
          "This is what made Avignon famous, so the story behind it is essential to a visit to the area.",
          "Worth a fleeting visit.",
          "Nice to see the place that was in the song I learnt so long ago",
          "Also known as Pont Saint-Benezet, this is the famous bridge from the song \u201csur le pont d\u2019avignon\u201d, it was built to cross the Rhone river but now only half of it is still hanging on.",
          "Visited early morning so nice and empty, good audio guide. The man selling the tickets was not very helpful.",
          "It has a really interesting history and there were explanations in lots of different languages",
          "Lovely childhood memories relived... But I wish it was free (5 Euros to get in)",
          "An interesting historic structure. Can purchase combo admissions with Palais Pape.",
          "Interesting but not that impressive. Looks much better in the pictures online.",
          "Ok ok so so nice view",
          "A piece of history of Avignon. In dedicated room a movie explaines the history of the bridge: how it's been built, why it is in this condition, how they discovered it. 5 euros well spent",
          "Iconic place. Bridge is a bit underwhelming but the story is well told",
          "Amazing what they could do 1000 years ago!!!",
          "Very nice even just to see it from the side.",
          "After 45 it more years of learning and singing the song, I finally got to see the Pont d'Avignon in really life!! Pretty cool \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Did you know there is a song about this place? Look it up! I can't get the song out of my head like I can't get Avignon out of my head. Southern France is magical in a way that is impossible to describe. Lavender fields, citrus fruits, and cozy towns surround this impressive structure.",
          "Audio-guide with interesting information about the bridge!!",
          "Very well preserved piece of history, a glimpse of how a medieval bridge looked like. The location features a wheelchair lift and a public bathroom.",
          "A must in Avignon. Good value too.",
          "It was a surprise to see that it doesn't actually go across the entire river, the museum in the interior and videos are quite interesting. The chapel on the entra ce of the bridge is also quite impressive.",
          "Much less clear guidance for Anglophone visitors than in the main papal palace in Avignon. Nice view over river and cute to be able to hum the song while on it.. (\"...sur le pont d'Avignon.....\". Just make sure this isn't positioned as the highlight of your trip...",
          "Such history and splendor. Warm too",
          "We were charged 4 Euros to see the bridge on student discount. The normal rate is 5 Euros per person. It's the remains of the bridge that was built many centuries ago by a shepherd with help from the locals. They give you a device after you \u2026",
          "Delightful place, well organised venue and well preserved. An informative display of the history of the bridge in a wonderful setting",
          "An unmissable spot in Avignon. You may heard of it if you were taught the famous children's song. Our if you like world history. You can just see it from afar or pay the \u20ac5 audio tour to walk it to learn about the history of this centuries \u2026",
          "It's half a bridge. You go for the history not the structure. I wouldn't drive hrs to get there but we did combine it with a palace and walk around Avignon.",
          "Stunning view! Lovely atmosphere at the river.  You can also walk on the bridge!",
          "Such an interesting place and so clean",
          "Loved the visit  Very windy on bridge. Recreation of what it looked like was interesting. Must see in Avignon.Got a discounted price jointly with Papal palace",
          "Touring.  Loved the architecture and history",
          "A site of engineering mishaps, something we should celebrate and learn from. Good audio history guide and signage for English speakers (and French :-).",
          "Amazing old town full of interesting shops and amazing views of the valley from the hilltop gardens.",
          "You have to pay to go on the bridge...it can be included with the castle combo ticket.  Bridge makes a cool pic from nearby, but actually walking on the bridge isn't too exciting",
          "I didn't get the audioguide so perhaps that might have affected my rating. We got the combo ticket with the palace. \nThere are some views of the palace from the bridge, but that was about it for me.",
          "Very interesting piece of history. I recommend getting the audio tour and taking the time to listen.",
          "Interesting location with nice views but I think it should probably be free instead of paying for entry.",
          "Nice stroll on the famous stone bridge. A cruise on the Rh\u00f4ne river would be a pleasant alternative to enjoy the views of Avignon.",
          "Avignon is amazing city. A must for visit.",
          "A place you have to visit, wonderful estructure from years ago with a really interesting history, the palace of the song and the city of Avignon.",
          "Good views of the Rhone river interesting history part of the towns heritage",
          "The bridge has a nice history story plus the culture of the region.",
          "It is not worth to pay 5EUR to see the bridge.  Nothing special there.  You can have similar views somewhere else and get the best view of the town at Rocker des Doms for free.",
          "Loved the ambiance of the papal palaces city!",
          "Beautiful place during the day.\nAround this object there are great views and good routes for jogging and walking...\nForm my personal opinion, have eyes wide open after sunset.\nDefinitely must see in Avignion.\nJust few minutes walk from there there famous fortifications in Avignon and Pope's Palace.",
          "This is the old bridge over the Rh\u00f4ne river at Avignon with a beautiful little chapel at the centre which is associated with the tale of the little shepherd benezet whose chapel it is, it is possible to visit the chapel but you can\u2019t cross the river to the other side because it was partly destroyed",
          "Great place to look out on the Rhone River.",
          "Very beautiful place . A good place to start the tour in Avignon",
          "Great views with interactive exhibits",

          "Nice views of the city and river and properly taken care of.",

          "Nice views and place, and cheap to visit.",
          "Covered this along with the palais de popes, the constructed started in the 11th century after the person received Devine intervention to build the bridge to connect to Avignon. The pont is now broken up and only 4 of the original arches \u2026",
          "Worth a visit but thought the audioguide quality was not great. Very interesting.",
          "Very nice view... The bridge has nothing extraordinary, but you must see since very close to palais des Papes",
          "An icon indeed and well worth a visit, it's next door to the Palais des Papes in Avignon.",

          "Very cool \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Emblematic place from the children's song with a really interesting history, which you can learn with the audioguide included in the visit. It is recomended to buy the combined ticket with the Papal Palace, as it is slightly cheaper than buying the tickets separately.",

          "great place for photos",
          "Perfect place to dance when visiting Avignon.",
          "Interesting place, recommendation to visit",
          "Must use the audio guide to know the history of the bridge and why. Don\u2019t miss the audio guide for listening to the Avignon traditional song. And also don\u2019t miss out to the other side of the bank to see the bridge, cathedral and Palais in a frame.",
          "Beautiful views and interesting information. Definitely worth the walk and the combined ticket with the Palais.",
          "Has a interesting history and it is unike with its halfnes",
          "Personne ont danc\u00e9! Nice park across the Rhone to hang out. Better than the bridge itself",
          "I did not see the value of this as a paid attraction",
          "Beautifully maintained site, great location convenient for visiting the city. Even has a ferry service across the river Rhone.",
          "a quick visit...love the AC in museum part!",
          "The bridge is super interesting. But go for the city!",
          "A perfect palace to shot dome photos. Ariving early in the morning and shot from both sides.\nMany many nice photos.\nClose to the bridge there is a small opening that can bring you back to the old city",

          "History museum from which we can see how things were in the Roman era",
          "The perfect end to our visit at the Palais des Papes! Pont d'Avignon is located at the very north of the old town's ramparts. The entrance to the bridge is not connected with the palace, you'll have to find your own way. You can tell you're \u2026",
          "A great view from the gardens above and the riverside.",
          "A lot of interesting places and beautiful old town",
          "It is a heritage indeed. but such price for this particular story behind this bridge? I\u2019m not sure if I want to contribute my cash again such poor illustration and not so appealing explanations. Scenery is great. Better take the combined ticket (palace+bridge) if you are going anyways.",
          "This was a wonderful experience. Walking down the half remaining bridge made me feel like walking down the roads of history. It is very well restored and audio guide is very useful. The staffs were a bit overloaded. Maybe more people is \u2026",
          "A nice little bit of culture, takes about 30 min to read everything and listen to the audio guide. Especially the video and 3D Animation explaining how they digitally reconstructed the bridge was very interesting. Audio Guides are available in multiple languages. \nIt\u2019s a little crowded though.",
          "Great views best seen at dusk",
          "Fantastic location by the side of rock castle and river Rhon",
          "Totally overrated. Nothing to see there. If you want to see an actual bridge, or viaduct, go to Pont du Gard.",
          "It's a pretty nice view of the river and comes with a sort of interesting commentary. The 5\u20ac fee to walk into a bridge makes it less than worth it. You're better off taking the free ferry across the river for some good photos of the town.",
          "It'll be nice when it's finished. Joking aside, it's a pleasant location and you know you want to dance on it.",
          "It's a nice bridge but it's broken. So only 4 stars.",
          "It's a beautiful place to visit. You need to buy a 5 euro ticket to go to the bridge but you can get a nice view of river Rhone from there.",
          "Not worth the money that you spend on the entrance. Far more beautiful from the coast. I mean, it\u2019s a bridge, what would you expect from it\ud83d\ude05",
          "A half finished bridge. So basically it is a dock or a pier.",
          "Learned a bit more about the history of the papacy in France and some of the conflict therein",
          "Very famous historical bridge, which is divided at the center of river.",
          "It is a half bridge and as such not worth a single penny to visit.  Take a photograph from the park above it (magnificent views and free of charge) and sing the annoying song in your head. \u201cSur le pont d\u2019Avignon, la la la la, la la la la etc\u201d",
          "Very impressive building, especially given its age of about 1100 years (they started building it in 9xx a.d.) I was in Avignon 36 years ago as a \"know it all\" 16 year old teenager hitchhiking through Europe and vowing not to do the \"tourist thing\". I was such an idiot!!! This will be an unforgettable memory for me.",
          "I really liked that experience, it's nice that there is a museum before you go to the bridge.",
          "Nice historical place. The entrance is EUR 5.--.",
          "This place is a must see for multiple reasons, however you should by the dual ticket which combines the Palais see Papes. This is a UNESCO heritage site and has a rich history which I recommend reading about ahead of time, if not then the \u2026",
          "Well for those that are not aware this is not a complete bridge. The reason for this is magnificently explained in the exposition just before you get onto the bridge itself. Make sure that you go downstairs to see the visualisations of how \u2026",

          "Must see.. We are impressed",
          "Difficult to take nice photos",
          "Remains of a 22 arch bridge with the river flowing through. Good start to your ascent to view the Papal Palace. Some lavender fields in the foreground make for a postcard picture",
          "Lazy buggers didn't finish the bridge! \n\n.... I wonder how many people made this same lame joke...",
          "Well worth seeing.",
          "The bridge itself......well. But the view on the old town is breathtaking.",
          "Very well made to last all these years.",
          "5\u20ac just to cross half a bridge. It should be free of charge.",
          "5 euro ti pay for nothing",
          "Was great to find out that the children's nursery rhyme is about an actual place!",
          "Beginning in 1234 the bridge was rebuilt with 22 stone arches. It was abandoned in the mid-17th century as the arches tended to collapse each time the Rh\u00f4ne flooded making it very expensive to maintain. Four arches and the gatehouse at the \u2026",
          "An impressive medieval bridge (or at least what remains of it) which allows you to cross half way into the river. A small, two storey Chapel can be visited on the bridge. There's also a very interesting documentary on how the bridge was built and why part of it collapsed. Well worth adding to a Papal Palace visit tour",
          "The bridge is pretty cool and has an interesting history.  The audio guide is a must if you want to learn about why the bridge was built.  You won't need to spend much time here so make sure to purchase the combination ticket for the bridge \u2026",
          "One of obligatory things to visit in Awignon. In fact there is not much to visit on the bridge itself. But at least I learnt something - I always thought that it was an unfinished work but I was wrong. It was simply destroyed some time ago and never rebuilt. One thing - it might be very windy on the bridge, so be prepared for that.",
          "Nice tour with audioguide",
          "Great experience! If you go to the Papal Palace as well, you can get a dual ticket for cheaper. Both are worth visiting while staying in Avignon!",
          "Such a prosperous town in the past with very high and fortress very tight surrounding. The Pont itself is very beautiful to see and for photography. We climbed that fortress and took some photos from there and on the way down to our car park through the old church /Palace.\nIt was a good exercise for us, lovely",
          "Done in 10minutes. Mind opening hours! We were there at 8pm and it was closed and traffic was so busy we couldn't cross the street over to the Rhone. Bit sad...",
          "Such a nice place :)",
          "looking forward to coming back once the bridge is complete \ud83d\ude09",
          "Very nice. The price is 5 euros if you want to go up.",

          "Bit hot to spend time",
          "Good value for money on a scenic and terribly interesting highlight of such a delightful city",
          "It's a great visit on a totally sunny day. Got nice pictures with clean sky views over the Rh\u00f4ne. \nI got the bridge's ticket together with entry for Palais de Pape. I think it was worth the price. You can have audiovisual guide for the \u2026",

          "Quite a disappointment. Everyone talks about that bridge, but seriously? The \"higway\" directly next and under it? It completely breaks the genius loci. Best views of it are from the park \"Rocher des Domes\" for me.",
          "Not as grand as Palais de Papes, but when you're in Avignon, you have to visit this spot also. Walk until the edge of the bridge and you can see a very beautiful view of Avignon across the river. Very lively and lovely. I'm not sure if the \u2026",

          "Awe inspiring",
          "It\u2019s not that spectacular, and you have to pay to go to the bridge. My personal highlight of Avignon is the view from \u2018Jardin des doms\u2019.",
          "An interesting and historical place.",
          "We don't understand the negative reviews. We did not know much about the bridge, we came, we learned, and left educated. This is a well-maintained site, that everyone knows from the song. The audio guide gives more background information that helped us put out Avignon experience in perspective. So happy we visited!",

          "Cute bridge that can be seen in 30 minutes. If you have limited time in Avignon, skip it. But we bought the ticket at the Pope's Palace that included entrance. Nice leisurely walk through the park that affords great views. The bridge provides free audio guides in numerous languages.",

          "Great place with nice view",
          "impressive but as a native from this town the cost for the bridge is a pure joke. \nI would not recommend you to spend a such amount just for that ...",
          "Don't touch this with a family of 5. Illuminations at the Palais des Papes are the same price and you've got an awesome experience up against a half - built bridge that you can see from the pavement or better still the other bank of The Rhone",
          "Unfortunately, the years have not been kind to this bridge,called pont St. Benezet. Most French Canadian children have learned this nursery rhyme \"Sur le pont  d'Avignon\" - that bridge no longer exists as it was washed away many times by the powerful Rh\u00f4ne floods.  That being said, Avignon is a must see!",
          "Invigorating  views!",

          "Worth seeing but not worth going to see",
          "It was really nice, but a tad unhygienic.",
          "We enjoyed walking on this picturesque bridge.  There are also clean bathrooms.",
          "Nice view!",

          "Famous bridge but you can't even walk on it :(",
          "An excellent site to visit, but rather overshadowed by the nearby Palais de Papes.",
          "If you want to get on the bridge, you have to be there earlier. The song has followed me since childhood and it was nice to be close - properly visiting would have required a little more planning. Be prepared for the roads being a lot slower - especially in the later afternoon.",
          "The bridge of Avignon has an interesting history and is visually unique, as the bridge discontinued just over half the way across. However without a guide or prior knowledge one may not know the most interesting facts.",

          "You can visit the remains of the Pont sea Avignon. With the ticket you will receive an audioguide that tells the history of the bridge. My suggestion is to but here the combo ticket to visit the Palais des Papes, you will avoid the bigger line usually present to buy the ticket at the latter place",

          "Very nice ROMAN structure that still exists!",

          "Magic place. Nothing more to say...",
          "Beautiful to look at, but the admission fee was just too high in my opinion, and didn't add anything for me. You are better off sitting on the shore looking at it.",
          "It is a beautiful bridge. But that's kinda just it...",
          "Beautiful medieval bridge, nice audio tour included in price of ticket, access to parts of the cities walls as well, there are some Chapels in the footings of the bridge. You can buy a combo ticket for the bridge and the palace of the Pope's",
          "One of those must-do's when you're in Avignon....",
          "Rather disappointing bridge as it isn't that special. You also have to pay to get up on the bridge.",

          "As le Palais des Papes part of French history. The two are unseparable. This one has a small lift. Unfortunately no one to dance with on it. I actually was totally surprised it ended in the middle of the river Rh\u00f4ne. Even French like me don't know all their history.",
          "Nice tourist hot spot. From the bridge yoe get a beautiful panorama of old town Avignon. You maybe sing that song in your mind all the way, so that you get more interested and really live the moment.",
          "So beautiful",

        "wiki": "The Palais des Papes (English: Palace of the Popes; lo Palais dei Papas in Occitan) is a historical palace located in Avignon, Southern France. It is one of the largest and most important medieval Gothic buildings in Europe. Once a fortress and palace, the papal residence was the seat of Western Christianity during the 14th century. Six papal conclaves were held in the Palais, leading to the elections of Benedict XII in 1334, Clement VI in 1342, Innocent VI in 1352, Urban V in 1362, Gregory XI in 1370 and Benedict XIII in 1394.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Palais is actually two joined buildings: the old palais of Benedict XII, which sits on the impregnable rock of Doms, and the new palais of Clement VI, the most extravagant of the Avignon popes. Together they form the largest Gothic building of the Middle Ages. It is also one of the best examples of the International Gothic architectural style. The construction design was the work of two of France\u2019s best architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean de Louvres, and the lavish ornamentation was the work of two of the best students of the School of Siena (Italy), Simone Martini and Matteo Giovanetti.\nIn addition, the papal library housed in the Palais (the largest in Europe at the time with over 2,000 volumes), attracted a group of clerics passionate in the study of \"belles-lettres\", amongst them the founder of humanism, Petrarch. At the same time, composers, singers and musicians were drawn to the Great Chapel of the Palais. It was there that Clement VI used the Mass of Notre-Dame of Guillaume de Machaut, there that Philippe de Vitry at the pope\u2019s invitation presented his Ars Nova, and there that Johannes Ciconia came to study.\nDue to its immense size, the Palais was also the place where the general organisation of the Church began to change. It facilitated the centralisation of services and the adaptation of operations in order to suit the needs of the papacy, creating a truly central administration for the Church. The manpower of the Curia (Church administration), while 200 at the end of the 13th century, surpassed 300 at the beginning of the 14th century and reached 500 people in 1316. To this were added over 1,000 lay officials working within the Palais.Despite this, the Palais became obsolete when the papacy found it necessary to return to Rome. The hope of reuniting Latin and Orthodox Christians, along with the achievement of peace in the Papal States in Italy, made the case of returning stronger. Added to that was the strong conviction of both Urban V and Gregory XI that the seat of the papacy could only be the tomb of St Peter. Despite strong opposition from the Court of France and the College of Cardinals, both popes found the means to return to Rome, the first, on 30 April 1362, the second on 13 September 1370. This time, the return was absolute.In the following centuries, the Palais lost all of its former glory, despite serving as the seat of two anti-popes and many cardinals. It retained, however, a \u201cwork of destruction\u201d aspect that French poets and writers such as Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert have referred to over the centuries, with its powerful sense of beauty, simplicity, grandeur and immortality.Since 1995, the Palais des Papes has been classified, along with the historic center of Avignon, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, under cultural criteria i, ii and iv.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Palais construction began in AD 1252. Avignon became the residence of the Popes in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as Pope Clement V, unwilling to face the violent chaos of Rome after his election (1305), moved the Papal Curia to Avignon during the \"Avignon Papacy\". Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor Pope John XXII set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops' palace was begun in earnest by Pope Benedict XII (1334\u201342) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river Rh\u00f4ne, was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the Palais Vieux (Old Palace) and Palais Neuf (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of 11,000 m2 (118,403 sq ft). The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy's income during its construction.\nThe Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of Pope Benedict XII. The austere Benedict had the original episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centred on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.\n\nUnder Popes Clement VI, Innocent VI and Urban V, the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. An architect, Jean de Louvres, was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a 52 m long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court d'Honneur) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures and wooden ceilings.\n\nThe popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the Papal Schism during which time the antipopes Clement VII and Benedict XIII made Avignon their home until 1403. The latter was imprisoned in the Palais for five years after being besieged in 1398 when the army of Geoffrey Boucicaut occupied Avignon. The building remained in the hands of antipapal forces for some years \u2013 it was besieged from 1410 to 1411 \u2013 but was returned to the authority of papal legates in 1433.\nAlthough the Palais remained under papal control (along with the surrounding city and Comtat Venaissin) for over 350 years afterwards, it gradually deteriorated despite a restoration in 1516. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789 it was already in a bad state when it was seized and sacked by revolutionary forces. In 1791 it became the scene of a massacre of counter-revolutionaries, whose bodies were thrown into the Tour des Latrines in the Palais Vieux.\n\nThe Palais was subsequently taken over by the Napoleonic French state for use as a military barracks and prison. Although it was further damaged by the military occupation, especially under the anti-clerical Third Republic when the remaining interior woodwork was cleared away for use of the structure as a stables \u2013 the frescos were covered over and largely destroyed \u2013 this ensured the shell of the building's physical survival. It was vacated in only 1906, when it became a national museum. It has been under virtually constant restoration ever since.\nCharles Dickens describes a tour around this building in his book:Pictures from Italy. His guide he describes as a she-devil with flashing black eyes who glories in the gory past when the building was used as a torture chamber.\n\n\n== Present ==\n\nThe Palais is today a historical and architectural landmark and primarily a tourist attraction, attracting around 650,000 visitors per annum, putting it regularly in the top ten most visited attractions in France. It also houses a large convention centre and the archives of the d\u00e9partement of Vaucluse, which include a research centre on the papacy of Avignon, organised jointly by the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome and the institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes.\nThe Palais regularly serves as an exhibition centre. The first major exhibition was initiated by Ren\u00e9 Char, in the Grand Chapel between 27 and 30 June 1947. Entitled \"Exposition de peintures et sculptures contemporaines\" (Exposition of contemporary painters and sculptors), it was the starting point for what would later become the Festival d'Avignon.The courtyard of the Palais des Papes is a central performance location during the Festival d'Avignon, which is held every year in July. It is also the site of many cultural and economic events including exhibitions, shows, and conventions.\nThe Palais is also home to the International Congress Centre, which was established in 1976 and today hosts a large number of events annually. These include congresses, parliaments, symposia, reunions and other gatherings, with the largest room, the 'Grande Audience', able to hold up to 700 guests.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nWith 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor space, the Palais is the largest Gothic palace in all of Europe and, due to its many architectural merits, one of the most important in the world. These merits were highlighted by Viollet-le-Duc, author of \u201cDictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle\u201d (Dictionary of French architecture from the 11th to the 16th century), who referred extensively to the Palais, including the thickness and height of its towers, the strength of its crenelated walls, the use of arcs for support on its fa\u00e7ades and its ability to withstand heavy and drawn-out sieges.\n\n\n=== The towers ===\n\n\n=== Cl\u00e9ment VI studium ===\n\nThe studium, or private study of Clement VI, is commonly called the chambre du cerf (room of the deer), on account of the justly-celebrated 14th-century frescoes, depicting courtly hunting scenes, that decorate the walls and vaults. The subject matter, while common in contemporary secular art, is as unexpected in a room supposedly dedicated to study as it is for a room in a papal apartment. The frescoes were probably painted by French artists, who were either highly influenced by Sienese art or assisted by Simone Martini and/or Matteo Giovanetti, both of whom served as Clement's court painter.\n\n\n=== The Great Tinel ===\nThis room was used primarily as a reception room. Covered with tapestries on starry blue background, there is actually nothing left of these sets. Indeed, a fire destroyed the palace in the 14th century: many parts have been restored or rebuilt.\nDuring conclaves, it is in this room that the cardinals met to elect a new pope. For the occasion, the room was walled and only a small opening was left open to provide all the necessary food. After each conclave, the walls were destroyed, revealing a vaulted room opening to the rest of the palace.\n\n\n=== The chapels ===\n\n\n==== Saint-Martial chapel ====\n\nLocated on the second level of the Saint-Jean tower, the Saint-Martial chapel relates through painting the main parts of Saint Martial's life. Matteo Giovanetti worked there in 1344 and 1345. The reading direction of the painting should be made from top to bottom.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Saint-Jean chapel ====\n\nFrom 1347 to 1348, Matteo Giovannetti was in charge of the Saint-Jean chapel, located under the Saint-Martial chapel.\n\n\n== Art exhibitions at the Palais des Papes ==\nThe Palais des Papes regularly hosts art exhibitions. The tradition began in 1947, when the art critic Christian Zervos and the poet Ren\u00e9 Char organised an exhibition of the likes of Matisse, Picasso, Braque and Mondrian. The exhibitions shown since then include two exhibitions of Picasso (in 1970 and 1973), the comprehensive 2000 exhibition \u201cLa beaut\u00e9 in fabula\u201d and, more recently, the exhibition \u201cLes Papesses\u201d (2013) and single exhibitions of Miquel Barcel\u00f3 (2010) and Stefan Szczesny (2014).\n\n\n== See also ==\nPalace of the Popes (disambiguation)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)\nThe Popes Palace, visit and report\nVisit the Pope's Palace and Avignon",

          "Located just above the Cathedrale Notre-Dame des Dom and the Palais des Papes, this green oasis with manicured gardens and shady walking trails as well as a pond populated by Koi carp provides good views to the Pont St-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet (the Pont d'Avignon in the French song), the Rh\u00f4ne",
          "I loved visiting Rocher des Doms... it was a very hot day and it was wonderful to rest a while in the shade of the trees next to the pond. A quaint tea shop there as well, although I did not order anything. There are a few great spots for photos of the river and over the",
          "A short walk up from the papal palace, this peaceful garden offers a magnificent view of the river and the surrounding countryside. Well worth the walk. If you like, you can walk all the way down to the river from here.",
          "This hill just to the north of the Palace is worth walking up. It is not far and you get fantastic views all around. The is a very good coloured indicator device made of coloured ceramic tiles indicating what you can (and cannot) see. You get a very good view of the trucated",
          "Just above the Popes Palace, this is a nice place for a stroll with good views. What else can l say to fill up the spave?",
          "Le Mistral was blowing but the sun was peeking through the clouds so we walked up to the top of the Rocher des Doms and were rewarded with views of the city, the Pont de Benezet and the broad Rhone river. Lots of school children enjoying a picnic on the lawns and the odd tourist",
          "Simple and well taken care and with a beautiful view. It reminded me a little bit of castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge in Portugal.",
          "Walked up to this brilliant park in the evening and it was well worth the effort. The views or the town and the Rhone are all they are advertised to be. Lovely place. And the fort entitles you to an ice-cream when you get down...",
          "The park is very nice and worth the climb. Great views over the city, the Rh\u00f4ne and Villeneuve and surroundings, and a bit of very welcome quiet from the mass-touristy buzz down there on the palace square.",

          "The gardens above the Popes Palace are free of charge to explore and offer a lovely chance to have a roam and see the views of the country side. Be sure to stop off in the cafe which offers a nice snack and drinks while sitting by the pond watching the ducks and fish.",
          "Although it is a might steep walk or climb (depending on your route) on a hot day, it is well worth it. The views that it affords over Avignon, the Rh\u00f4ne and far beyond are superb. There\u2019s a restaurant-surprisingly moderately price, where you can get a cheap meal or a cheap",

          "Interesting gardens, but the Mistral was blowing very hard when we visited, so a very cold and blowy time. The views are fantastic over the Rhone, tho'.",
          "We visited on a Saturday morning and had been advised that this provided wonderful panoramic views. We were not disappointed. It would be quite difficult for those with walking / movement difficulties. We had a nice coffee by the pond at the top. Worth walking up to.",
          "We enjoyed the smattering of flowers throughout the park. We walked through a portion of it going from the Pope's Palace to Notre Dame.",
          "If you have time (you should make time) to head up to Rocher des Doms. The gardens were nice to look at but it's the views of the city and surrounding area that makes this worth the walk. Walk around the top of the whole park and get a glimpse of the surrounding region (there's",
          "This small park is on the hill above the Popes Palace. On a hot day it affords you some seating out of the direct sun. It does get windy on some faces. THere are superb views from various viewpoint around the top (inc the truncated Pont). There is a cafe where on hot days an ice",
          "Went during winter, so there wasn't much blooms. But we get to see the city from a higher viewpoint. Descend from the garden to get closer to pont d'avignon. Entrance to the garden is free, close at 5.30pm in the winter but the guards will probably stop people from entering by",
          "We visited this garden in December and wished we had more time to enjoy it. We got hustled out at closing time... well before sunset, so be prepared for that. I had read the reviews and noted complaints about it being cold and windy... oh please. Put your hood up and wear a",
          "We walked up the hill from the Palais des Papes actually looking for a way to the bridge. We found it from a great height and were able to take some great photos from the look out. From this spot you could easily photograph across the Rhone and see the castle on the other",
          "Came upon the gardens while wending our way towards the Golden Statue atop the Cathedral ! The place was packed with over a hundred students all enjoying lunch & picnics on blankets & towels in any shaded spot available. The view over Avignon & across the river was great and it",
          "My husband and I wandered into Rocher des Doms on our first day in Avignon\u2026.thinking we\u2019d return another day. With so much to do and see, we never did! Great scenery, views and wind! I almost lost my hat.",
          "Wonderful place to see out into the surrounding lands. This is an easy walk up after seeing Pope's Palace. Would love to picnic here if the weather is nice!",

          "We enjoyed the stroll up to these gardens. November is not the best month to see the plants and trees though. There were stunning views around especially of the the old bridge. The toilets were very basic. We were glad that we went to see it even if it was cold and windy!",
          "Pleasant hilltop gardens with great views down towards the river and the pont d'Avignon. Definitely worth a wander round, and I would also recommend the cafe, where we had a nice coffee. Very nicely situated by a duck pond. As one previous reviewer has commented, it doesn't",
          "Beautiful gardens, nice ramps, stunning views over the Rh\u00f4ne river, parts of Avignon and its most famous bridges. At the top there is a nice caf\u00e9 under the trees by the duck pond. A very pleasant walk, perfect location for some extra pictures. Be mindful, though, the wind can",
          "Head there to get the lay of the surroundings, then leave. The only positive was just that, to see where the pont d\u2019avignon had once ended. Otherwise not really worth the (very limited) effort.",
          "A nice park covering a hill above Rhona river. There is a beautiful view of Pont d'Avignon, opposite Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and the river itself. Full-grown trees offer welcome shade on hot summer days.",
          "So people visiting this \"park\" are not allowed to enter with dogs. Shame on you Avignon. I appreciate one cannot enter the Palais, but there is no other place to wait for your partner, group if with a dog if we cannot enter the park. How disgraceful.",

          "From the river, hiking up to the Rocher des Doms is another way to the Pope Palace. The garden is a good break from all the historical places and experience the life of locals. The view atop is also excellent!.",
          "We climbed the steps all the way from the river. Lovely views all the way up. This park gives breathtaking views of Avignon and the surrounding areas. The view of mount Ventoux is special. A nice change from the history and popes....",
          "Others have said it all before me, but to add my little bit... if you have already been to the cathedral and climbed all those steps you already half way there. Very pretty and the wrap around View is outstanding. Very lovely. Great to do if you plan on going to Villeneuve",
          "This beautifully designed, inviting and surprise-filled park dazzled us with extraordinary vistas, charming niches and non-controversial statues for this American. In between visiting art and historic sites, this is a lovely respite.",
          "As you tour the associated historical sights of Avignon, the Rocher des Doms is one to not miss. It's a change of pace, a place of green solitude amongst the stone of the bridge, church and Popes Palace. And as a bargain, there is a small cafe in the middle of the greenery and",
          "Whether or not you like to look at gardens, or are simply seeing a bit of peace and quiet, these gardens are well worth a visit. They also provide the best viewpoint of the river and famous bridge down below.",
          "The more you come UP on the way to the gardens, the more you find shade and freshness. Intimate spots and \"belvederes\" on the countryside around Avignon: everything, in those gardens, is surprising and after all delightful.",
          "Nice enough walk and views but nothing spectacular. Easy way to spend a couple of hours on a nice sunny day",
          "At the top end of the town, past the Palace des Papes, these gardens are worth the walk for the splendid views over the Rhone and Avignon's famous bridge.",
          "Beautiful gardens to wander through, matched by stunning views over the city and the region. Lovely spots for kids to play as well. Do visit.",
          "Standing proud behind the Popes' Palace is this rocky outcrop - not much of a climb to find some leafy shade, places to sit or stroll, and some magnificent panoramas of Avignon, its rooftops, miles of surrounding countryside, the River Rh\u00f4ne and, of course, the famous Pont",
          "Fantastic views from this hilltop next to the Pope's palace. If you are in Avignon go there to see Mt.Ventoux, Villeneuve and the Rhone.",
          "I would like to have a park like this in my city. A beautiful, relaxing spot with tables by the water. You can feed the ducks and fish. Food was very good as was the wine. It's definitely worth the walk up the hill and there's also a great view. Highly recommended for lunch.",
          "Lovely area just further up the hill from popes palace. Nice & peaceful with beautiful city views. There is a small cafe in the middle along with a small children's play area. Great place to go with a picnic & enjoy some shade",
          "We visited this park after we walked through Palais des Papes. It was a very hot day out, so the steep climb into the park was daunting, but we made it and were rewarded with plenty of trees that provided lots of shade. The fountains and plants provide a very serene atmosphere.",
          "What a magnificent garden! Well worth the uphill walk from the square in front of the Palace. Views in 270 degrees, including the famous Pont d'Avignon, the Rhone River, and acres of agricultural lands. Within the gardens, there are several lovely fountains and grottos. All",
          "Being such a short climb up from the palace, the Rocher des Doms is perfect. The view is great, and the park offers shade for anyone wanting to relax. My boyfriend and I had a little picnic on one of the park benches next to the pond, and it was splendid.",
          "Quick walk from the Papals Palace, the park offers great views on St Benezet bridge, the Rh\u00f4ne, and Mt Ventoux.",
          "It's well worth the climb to the viewpoints on the top of the rock - either the steps from near the free ferry or via the rather easier slopes above the Cathedral. Excellent views in all directions, including downwards over the famous bridge.",
          "Pretty small park near the Papal Palace. To reach it there is a lot of climbing. The park is very pleasant and overlooks the papal palace and the river.",
          "When you go to the top of the Pope's Palace, you will come across a huge pond with a coffee shop by the side. The area is covered with huge shady trees which make it a perfect spot to rehydrate and relax a moment from the scorching heat of summer. Very tranquil place with lots",
          "Fairly peaceful and somewhere to take kids in the city. Picnic tables and nice moon rises and sun sets.",
          "The park had views only surpassed by the breezes on a hot July afternoon. Great for picture buffs. I guess it was good to be the pope!",
          "For stunning views of the surrounding countryside and the rivers you have to visit this park. Anyone keen on road cycling needs to, ahem, walk up to see Mont Ventoux.",
          "Pope Palace worth a visit . The Rocher des Doms on a very hot June day a must, beautiful and the views from many different positions are breath taking,",
          "We made a point of finding this little spot to take pics of views and relax....a bit of a walk up beside the Palais but worth a look if you have a half hour to spare during your visit to Avignon.",

          "We found this by accident, sort of got a bit lost looking for the Pont D'Avignon! It's gorgeous, ponds, waterfalls, a little lake and lots of little gardens, a beautiful sort of secret herb garden where we sat and had an ice cream in the shade. Fantastic panoramic views",
          "Stunning views to be had from numerous viewing points in the park, gets busy with tourists and locals alike. Lovely place to walk around and simply sit and drink in the surroundings, have a picnic or people watch. There is a small Caf\u00e9 in the centre of the park next to the",
          "Quiet, very good views of the area from up on this hill. A good restorative after the hustle and bustle around the Popes Palace and busy streets of Avignon. Don't miss it!",
          "We entered a door in the old wall of the city without really knowing where we were going. After climbing about 1000 steps we arrived in the beautiful park of Rocher des Doms. It was a quiet little paradise, compared to the noise and congestion of the city below. Lots of shade",
          "The climb up to the park is rewarded with excellent views over the local countryside. Offering shade on a hot day and a moment's respite from the commercialism of downtown Avignon, the is a place to cherish.",
          "There are few open spaces inside the walls of the city. This is the best, with views over the river Rhone. Come here with a picnic, relax, enjoy the view, wander round the gardens - don't expect a botanical garden, and take the stairs down to the famous bridge",
          "A short walk uphill from the Pope's Palace and the Petite Palace, this has a commanding view of the city and up and down the Rhone. A small park with pond and ducks, shaded sitting areas and a restaurant. Well-worth a visit.",
          "We visited the Papal Palace and bridge at Avignon, and at the end of the day went up the hill to the cathedral. Next to it was this lovely little park on the top with beautiful views of the river and bridge from the heights. There were benches and trees and flowers and was just",
          "Very nice place to visit if you like gardens. It has a small cafe in the centre alongside a fountain and lots of trees to provide some shade from the sun. It's a walk up from the main square outside the Palais des Papes but the views make it worth it.",
          "A bit of a walk up the hill from the Palais des Papes but worth it. Beautiful gardens, shady places, great views and a cafe. The best view of the pont du Avignon. A place away from the crowds to relax and have a break, or bring a picnic lunch.",
          "In certain times of the year (e.g. May, the air is perfumed with the strong scents of the flowers and because it's quite a hike to get there, there aren't hoards of people!",
          "The gardens provided us with a welcome break from the throngs of tourists in Avignon. There are nice views of the river and a caf\u00e9 that we did not visit. The gardens are not extensive or spectacular, but are very pleasant -- with ample bench space.",
          "Nice to have a stroll around. Fabulous views from the lookout. Lots of shady spots to sit down to view the water feature. Lots of birds and ducks. After visiting Palais Des Papes you can walk up the ramp to through the garden, taking in the view then walk down the track to",
          "Came up here on our way to visit the Palais des Papes. You have to walk up quite a lot of steps to get up here but it's definitely worth it. It's basically a really pretty garden with water fountains on the top of a tall rock which has really good views. There is also a",

          "There are tao playgrounds here but watch small children because there are quite a few places where they could fall if they wander from the main paths. The toilets aren't very pleasant but they are open and they work. Some trees to climb, grass to sit on, a few picnic tables and",

          "We walked to the end of the Rue Republique to near the Palais de Papes and then up the ramps to the Rocher des Doms. This rocky outcrop towers over the river and countryside and faces Villeneuve-lez-Avignon and Fort Andre. From its terrace we had panoramic views. It was",
          "While living in Avignon Centre Ville this was my go to place to relax and unwind. Of course I lived there in the off season so there weren't as many tourists at that time, but regardless of when you visit you must go here. It's delightful place for a stroll - alone, as a",
          "You'd think it would be wonderful, but it's a long way up and given the plethora of fantastic views in this area, you can skip this one. You've seen the bridge from down below, right? And you need your energy to walk the Pope's Palace. The \"gardens\" need help. The best part is",
          "A beautiful park on top of the acropole of Avignon. Well organized and nice for a stroll. Recommended.",
          "Lovely park and no doubt fabulous in summer but even doing it in winter the place is spectacular and the views across the Rhone and to pre-medieval time \"France\" awesome. Took 45-60 minutes and was a lovely walk around. Can almost feel the Popes walking around taking it all in",
          "This high-point gives 360-degree views of Avignon and the Rh\u00f4ne River. Located near the Palais des Papes it is easily accessible with a slight climb. It is child-friendly and has lots of benches for sitting and enjoying the panoramic views.",
          "Spectacular views of the famous bridge of the river and the area across the city. This is a relaxing and deeply contemplative place.",
          "Don't be daunted by what appears to be a steep climb. I have joint issues, and I made it going slowly. The view is worth it! You can see all sides of the Rhone River, Villeneuve across the river, and the snow-capped mountains in the distance. The park is lovely also, with a",
          "The views are spectacular, particularly of the bridge and the river. The whole place has a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere - the ideal place to chill, people watch and catch some sun. To be honest I could have spent the whole afternoon there.",
          "The gardens next to Palais des Papes are quiet and relaxing (at least in the off season). Fountains, ducks and lots of paths make it enjoyable but the real treat is walking to the edge and looking down on the Rh\u00f4ne, the island, Pont d'Avignon, and the sites all around.",
          "If you like great views over Avignon, you must choice to visit the Mont\u00e9e du Moulin; it's a strong but a beautiful walk and you must have time; nice for making pictures from the bridge of Avignon, so you can see the no - ending bridge.",
          "Fabulous views of the bridge, island and town (Villeneuve L\u00e8s Avignon) across the water. It's also a beautiful walk and park by itself.",
          "Very interesting and definitely something you might want to photograph at different times of the day and evening.",
          "Good place to visit if you are in Avignon but not a destination. Audioguide gives a good explanation of the history of the bridge which was damaged/destroyed by the river on numerous occasions. Interesting structure but not nearly as niiteresting as other old structures (e.g",
          "Yes, my wife really enjoyed sitting in a good spot to just relax and oak up the sun. It really is such a lovely park, right next to the Palais des Papes and some other museums. Nice views too!",

          "When you go to Avignon you go for the rich history and a beautifully preserved medieval walled city itself. We spent four days there and it was everything we expected however something seemed to be missing some intangible we could not put our fingers on. We realized that even",
          "We were in Marseille in last Christmas and visited this place alongwith the famous Pont Du Gard. . We took 07-10am train from Marseille St Char and reached at Avignon Centre station at 8 -18 am. It was 75 mins journey from Marseille rail station and the fare was about \u00a312",

          "I walked up here while my wife was resting. The views are spectacular, You can see the Rhone and the dam, the surrounding sites, and even Marseille when it is clear. The park is very pleasant. I am glad I went to see it as I got some great pictures but this is not a must see",
          "Beautiful gardens and great vistas. Worth the little climb. At the top of the gardens, you have a beautiful view of the pont d'Avignon. Stairs will provide you a quick access to the bridge area. No fees.",

          "Once one treks up the hill to the gardens the views are stunning. It was quite warm and we welcomed the pleasant breeze when we reached the top. Bring a small picnic or eat something light at the small pond.",

          "Nice panoramic views of Avignon and surroundings. Nice shady park. Well worth the climb up the hill.",
          "Went to the park on our last morning before catching train and no regrets for the visit. Beautiful day, great views and well worth the climb. Highly recommended ( or take the train up the hill). Romantic and beautiful and a great place to have a sandwich. I do recommend that",

          "This park was delightful. the views, the ducks, lunch by the pond. You get a 360 degree view from up above. Make sure to take a good look around and get as many pictures as you can. Also please do visit the restaurant, you will not regret it. I personally think it is the",
          "Having slogged around the Pope's palace, it was good to have the chance to walk through this pleasant park with fine views over the river towards the famous Avignon bridge. The park cafe was an unexpected find. Drinks and food were reasonably priced and it was pleasant to sit",

          "Been to Avignon before but missed this lovely park on top of the hill. It's a bit of a climb but can be made easier by walking up the longer switch backs. Parts are in shade which makes it even more pleasurable in hot weather and the views from the top do not disappoint.",
          "A nice walk. Breezy, sunny, nice views of town and across the rhone. In August its late summer so vegetation starting to dry out, but still very nice",

          "We walked up the hard way, up the steps, which was hard on a hot day but it was worth for the view of Avignon from the top. Plenty of shady places to sit plus a cafe but we didn't go there. A favourite meeting place for the French as there were lots of people there of all ages.",

          "Was looking forward to seeing the gardens but was disappointed. We went in August so were expecting crowds but it was packed out. The views were of course brilliant but the gardens were very poor. The grass was in bad condition not that you could see much beneath the baby",

          "Climb to the Jardin du Rochers des Doms for panoramic view of the Rhone River Valley and the broken bridge. Park and ramparts at the hilltop where Avignon was first settled. For the best view find the small terrace behind the odd zodiac display across the grass from the pond-sid",
          "Yes, it's quite a climb, and the little cafe here serves mediocre ice cream treats...but it's so worth it. Even if you only have a day or two in Avignon, make sure you come up here for the view.",
          "Having been to Avignon several times in the past, this is the first time we went to this area. It is a large park overlooking the Palais des Papes on one side and the Rhone on the other. There is no charge, making it an excellent choice for families as well as others. The",
          "If you are coming here to see beautiful gardens don't waste your time. However the views of the surrounding area from here are amazing.",
          "Nice view on the Rhone and a part of the city. To get there you have first to climb stairs. A lot of them !",
          "The numerous steps are so worth the incredible view you get from here. It is an exceptional site and you get it for free, differently from pretty much anything else in Avignon!",
          "This parc is placed at one side of the city, between the river and the Pope's palace. It is place on a hill where you have a great view of the city. You can go there to relax with your friends.",
          "The park was nice, not wow but nice enough. There were lots of great view points and worth a visit. I wouldn't expect to spend too long there.",
          "This little park perched on the top of the hill and right next to the Palais des Papes is well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful small park, just north of the Palais de Papes. If you're there anyhow, do plan a short walk to see the views over the city and the Rhone river. It's certainly worth your while.",
          "We took a stroll in this park and managed to get to the top where we got a clear view of the famous broken bridge. It was a lovely stroll and the place is well maintained. The view was amazing",
          "After visiting the pope's castle, take the walk up this hill. Spectacular views of the surroundings. Lot of people just hanging out here, enjoying themselves. Looks like a popular family destination.",
          "Great park adjacent to the Palais des Papes. I'm so glad we made the hike up, to take in the views of the Rhone and the Pont d'Avignon. Be sure to see the duck pond and relax on a bench under a shady tree if the weather is hot.",
          "I am always mixing up this bridge with the Pont D'Avignon ( I blame the song) Anyway, it is amazing how it spans but not entirely the river !!",
          "We loved this space and spent quite a bit of time walking around. The wind speed was AMAZING when we were there. Great views of the city and surrounding area from many locations.",
          "We highly recommend you take the short walk uphill from the Palais des Papes and into the park - Rocher des Doms. From the top, you overlook the river and the Pont Saint Benezet. It is a great spot to view the bridge, the river traffic, and the island etc on the other side.",
          "Small, twenty minutes and you covered most of it Nice and very well maintained with great view of the river and city Nice water pond inside",
          "Nice garden to spend some time in shade in hot summer. One can have a nice view of the city, the river and beyond.",
          "This is a nice place to see the sunset, you can sit back enjoy the riverside, cool breeze and sunset. There is a small fountain and the whole feel of the place summarise the french laid back life. Gives a good view of city, pont du avignon. You can also enjoy a small walk up the",
          "It was a broken bridge which was affected by a great flood and then decided not to reconstruct it but made a self distinguish to other landmarks, been a destination to many especially the river cruises that dock close to it.",
          "Historic site with great views. Good disabled access by lift to bridge level. Obtain key from booking office.",
          "I felt this was a waste of money, it was literally half a bridge across the river, which is very dirty due to sewage and waste! not a lot to see and only take 5 minutes to walk to the end and back!",
          "nice historical landmark in this lovely town. quite a lot of history is tide to it ans also a children's song about it. nice to see",
          "So Wonderfull this place, land of God, feel thankfull in soul if you have chance put your feet on this land,",
          "The view of this bridge from the other side of the river is impressive. Undoubtedly, an important landmark of Avignon.",
          "I didn't go onto the bridge as I saw that there was a 30euro fee. As my French was very limited I wasn't able to understand what I would get for my money. If budget is limited you can get some wonderful photos riverside.",
          "It's a bit of a hike to access this area, but well worth in in the views and the beauty of the place. WC is located in the concession stand and can be used if you buy something there (ice cream, drink, etc.). Sunday morning is a terrific time to visit - you get a peaceful",
          "Well worth a visit, if only for the stunning views. The lovely park itself is almost a bonus! Highly recommended.",
          "A pleasant place to walk, away from the heat of the town, and a good place to photograph the bridge. Also good views across to the castle at Villeneuve, and along the river",
          "There are a few entry points to the gardens but if possible enter, coming up from the Popes Palace and you will see the beautiful war memorial, sculpted by Louis Botinelly, it is superb, located at the entrance to the gardens. The gardens are lovely for a bit of piece and",
          "This viewpoint is adjacent to the Palace of the Popes and a short uphill walk. Your reward is a quiet place to take in nice views of the Rhone River, the St Benezet bridge and the neighboring villages.",
          "Avignon is a busy tourist town. Although close to the palace this park has quiet corners where you can escape the crowds. It also has shade where you can shelter from the sun. A good place to take a relaxing break.",
          "We took a walk up here the first evening we were in Avignon and loved the views of the mountains, villages, and the St. Benezet bridge. It was very quiet and peaceful. Nice place to walk around or just sit and relax and enjoy the quiet.",
          "Good panoramic views of the area, but the gardens are very ordinary and little disappointing. But at least it is free entry . Be there before it closes. Think it is around 6:30pm.",
          "Why pay to walk on the Pont, when you can get the best view for free from this garden look-out. Best way to get there is from the plaza in front of the Palais De Papes. Take your own water bottle and snacks as they charge extortionate prices at the cafe in the gardens. Well",
          "The Rocher des Doms is a nice garden with great view near to the Pope's Palace. Even though the walk is uphill but the distance is closer than we thought. Once inside, there are many corners worth taking photos. Most of all, the view point is worth the effort to climb up",
          "There are wonderful views all round avignon from this pretty park, including of the pont d'avignon. It has a fountain and a cafe and was a good spot for a picnic. It was also about the only green space I found in avignon to sit and enjoy the sunshine. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "While on a morning tour, we saw this \"park\" from a lower street and asked the guide if it was worthwhile and upon her comments we decided to visit it on our own. There are two ways to reach it, a steep climb of about 190 stairs or through hilly steep back streets. Need to be",
          "What a contrast..mthe setting is so ancient and so is s the story.l and then there are the vehicles,zipping fast,mehich bring you back to present day. The audio guide was most helpful and the entire area is picture perfect.",
          "The park itself is not a big thing, but the view is spectacular! Very close to the Palais des Papes. There were many children, a class even had some kind of physical training class in the park. So if you're looking for a calm and silent place, avoid this park.",
          "This is a lovely place to go for wonderful views over Avignon. It isn't a large area, but large enough to feel it isn't crowded. There are views in all directions, but the best view is over the river, and particularly the Pont d'Avignon. The cafe is peaceful, and overlooks a",
          "No fee. It's a park full of local life and providing a shady reprieve from hot summer sun. Nice views of the river and Roman bridge.",
          "A good tour for 1 hour or so. Nice info on chapel and good films downstairs on history. See the films!",
          "To be sure to have the best view on the town and on the all area, the famous bridge, the other bank of the Rhone, and the Mont Ventoux Le rocher des Doms is the ideal place to be. You have ti go up the Popes garden and cross it. You can turn round and take the monumental",
          "Pleasant walk above the Palais de Papes. Good views on the climb and a number of viewpoints at the top. At the top there is a nice pond with ducks and a cafe, where we enjoyed a good salad. Toilet was awful so don't rely on it!",
          "This is a free attraction offering beautiful views over the Rhone and helps visualize the length and size of the Pont d'Avignon that connected Avignon with Villenueve les Avignon and the fort there that protected the bridge.",
          "Nice garden with good views of bridge, Rhone and countryside. No formal gardens but a pleasant area for a stroll. Could take lunch up there for a picnic, has a cafe and small childrens play area.",
          "The bridge to nowhere. Learn about the history of the bridge. A nice walk across the River Rhone, an learn about it's history with a recorder.",
          "Well worth to spend an hour or two to talk a relax walk around and enjoy the spectacular view from here.",
          "Worth the walk up to see the views of the Pont d'Avignon. If you have kids there are little novelty cars for them to ride.",
          "We climbed the stone slope from the square in front of the palace in the expectation of good views of the river from the park. The view was there, but It was nothing to write home about. We had to share the viewing space with the tourist train that stopped for a photo shoot and",
          "I was a bit disappointed. The walk was nice enough. Plenty of benches to rest on while you enjoyed the views. In early May the gardens were still sparse and you were left with the feeling of a small park. Nothing special.",
          "This is a great place to just wander about and take in the wonderful views of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and Villenueve-les-Avignon. The gardens themselves are mostly shrubs with some flowers and flowering plants, but the location on the hill makes it special. There are wide lawns to",
          "Nice small park, but that's it. The view over the river is nice, but nothing really interesting other than that.",
          "A leisurely walk up the gardens is a good relaxation after visiting the old city or the Palais des Papes. The gardens are very pretty with lots of benches to rest. Arriving at the end of the gardens you are rewarded by an unobstructed panorama over the Rhone , the pont Benezet",
          "Great paronamic view of avignon including fort andre and the avignon old bridge. Close at 8pm, great for a walk before dinner.",
          "Spend some time in this area and enjoy the beautiful views of the Rh\u00f4ne River and the valley well beyond and up to the hills. It is extremely tranquil and ever so calming. Enjoy it!",
          "Adjacent to the Palais de Papes, don't miss walking up the hill to Rocher de Doms. The gardens are beautiful. Benches for relaxing. Would be a great place if you have kids (playgrounds and also you can rent pedal carts with a carved horse attached for them to ride in, 1-8 years",
          "This is a climb whatever direction you take. But it is well worth it. We ascended with our son and his family so pushing the push chair became part of family exercise. There is a little lake at the top which gives the very young an opportunity to feed the ducks. Views are",
          "We visited this area twice, once when it was raining, and again when it was very sunny with the mistral wind blowing very hard. It is quite a steep climb to reach the area. We climbed both ways, up the steep steps from the river which are not for the faint-hearted, and we also",
          "Such a beautiful place (interesting looking trees, nice flowers, playground for children) to lay out a blanket and take in the fantastic views. I recommend staying from the late afternoon till sundown to soak up some sun and watch the sunset.",
          "The remains of Pont de Gare are easily walkable from town as town is right along the river. You do not need to pay to walk on it, perfectly viewable from the banks. I have heard so much in art history about the Pont I was glad to finally see it. I liked this a lot, free, walk",
          "A great park with some nice views of Avignon and the Rhone River. Easy walk to park from tourist bus parking area but to go to the top can be difficult for some. Worth the short hike to the top for great views.",
          "It is a nice place to go. Anyway, the bridge has fallen. It gives you some ambience. I like it. We sometimes need bridges to fall.",
          "A lovely park that should not be missed. Views of the famous Pont, Villeneuve Lez Avignon, Avignon itself and lots more.",
          "It s much younger than the Palace but looks as a part of it , especially from the opposite shore. The shining figure is visible from everywhere.",
          "Nice relaxing gardens with terrific vies of the otherwise gray, dull Avignon, the Rhone and the Alps. If you walk from the palace's exit after the tour you will have to climb up a stairway.",
          "Beside/above the Palais, and has beautiful views across the river, of the old city, and toward the Alps. There are some benches, a children's playground, a duck pond/fountain, and some statues, and it is a nice place to relax and take in the views.",
          "The gardens are located beside the Popes Palace. You have to walk up a steep roadway to get to the gardens. The view from the garden is breathtaking. You can see for miles. There is a pond and ducks and activities for children.",
          "Views are fantastic of other sites in and around Avignon and even in winter it's a lovely relaxing place.",
          "We skipped the tour of the palace, and took a walk in the park behind. Rocher des Doms offers amazing views of Pont St Benezet, the ramparts, the Rhone, as well as the more intimate experience of an incredibly beautiful outdoor space. It caused me to wonder why my own country",
          "The gate at this point was cut out of the rock. The view is unbelievable from this point as well. The traffic in th area was a little dangerous however",
          "Just next to the Cathedral Notre Dame des Doms. Fabulous place to relax. There are some outstanding views of the surrounds.",
          "These gardens are a pleasure to visit and provide a wide panorama of views in different directions, particularly across to Villeneuve lez Avignon, and Philip Bel Tower and the fort. Great photo opportunity.",
          "Just a few hundred yards from the Palais des Papes, this garden provides a wonderful view across the Rhone, and can form part of a walking tour of Avignon.",
          "Well worth the climb up the steps but u can walk up the road, which is much easier. Why Go? To see the truly awesome views and enjoy the pretty park Also has a lovely cafe by the duck pond Close to the Palace of the Popes",
          "Well maybe not a climb as you can walk up zigzag ramps to the top and it's not too steep but if you are over 65, you may need to sit down and enjoy the panoramic views. It's a destination for everyone. Plenty for children to do and space to run about, a grotto to see and then",
          "Great views, panorama and tranquil parkland. What is not to like. The little caf\u00e9 next to the pond is quite agreeable for a pizza or salas or sandwich. Avignon is a real Jewel of the region.",
          "We climbed up one afternoon from the river. It's a long climb - but a lovely well-laid out park at the top, with great views back over the river to the Fort and over Avignon",
          "Anywhere you look when you are in Rocher des Doms will be a beautiful photo for you. You can also bring your kids to play and study a little about the birds, the geology and the trees over there! It is an amazing work of men in harmony with nature.",
          "We wandered up here on our first day in Avignon and it is a wonderful park. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the views over the river and famous bridge are just wonderful. It was also quite peaceful away from the touristy square below",
          "Just a nice view from the Pont d'Avignon at the moment Since it is so close to the bridge itself and in between the latter and the Palais , it will not hurt you to pass by",
          "A lovely garden on the hillside above Palais des Papes. Obviously a popular place with local families. Places to sit, a little grotto, fantastic views over the Alpilles and to Mont Ventoux and of Pont St Benezet. A little cafe for refreshments with a shaded seating area by a",
          "As a schoolboy, I learned this song in early French lessons. From then, always had a yearning to see the famous bridge. And guess what? It is as great as you can imagine, a Roman bridge still standing over a significant length. Have to see this great landmark",
          "Worth the visit very peaceful and relaxing walk early morning is the best the bridge is also a good walk Can get some great photo shoots",
          "The gardens at the top of the Rocher des Doms are worth the hike. You can also get there on the tourist train that travels around. Pleasant gardens, nice place to have lunch by the pond. But don't expect to find a working W/C. There are two outdoor privies, which were",
          "A lovely park with views of the Pont d'Avignon, River Rhone and surrounding countryside. On a clear day you can see Mont Ventoux.",
          "We enjoyed standing in the sun observing the large carp that had congregated at the bridge pier, where the water was slack and debris had gathered after a night storm I thought that the exhibition, related to the history of the bridge, really informative. it was surprising",
          "Great views, different perspective on bridge and Popes' palace and viiew down Rhone. Restaurant in centre of park.",
          "Nice to see but underwhelming. It's a bridge. Granted it has history, but we were not overly impressed.",
          "This is good place to take a relaxing romantic or family stroll. Views include parts of the Palais des Papes, Pont d'Avignon, Mont Ventoux and the Luberon. It makes for a good place to relax in between your visit to the Palais and your descent to the Pont.",
          "You can't go to Avignon without visiting here. Very interesting facts about how the bridge was built and why it is as it is today.",
          "Very close to the popes palace, good place to walk Around and take a few pics. Nice relaxing feel, good views",
          "If you visit the city it would be almost impossible to miss this as it is right in the middle of the river by the main bridge into the fortified part of the city. We walked to it early in the morning and there were only a handful of people there. We then walked across the bridge",
          "A piece of history not to be missed when you visit Avignon. We did not go on the bridge but you can get good views by taking the free ferry across the river and walking to the next bridge.",
          "After visiting the Popes Palace we wandered up into the gardens before descending back down to the pont. Things are a little quieter up here and offer superb views of the river and other sites around the town. We noticed a lot of locals sitting on the grass reading in the sun.",
          "You can't go wrong with the gardens here. There is a little cafe in the center, and a fountain, square with sweeping views of the city and also views of the Palace of the Popes! Peaceful, scenic and lovely. Take a few minutes respite from the crowds and visit here.",
          "if you visit the Palace of the Popes then the Rocher des Doms is a must its close by and is known all over the world due to the famous song",
          "Go visit this to get great views of the area and river. You are able to also walk along part of the wall of the city and old tower.",
          "The views from the top, of the Pont St Benezet, Villeneuve les Avignon and the surrounding countryside are fantastic. The caf\u00e9 by the lake is also lovely and the food and drinks choices excellent for a park caf\u00e9. We spent a happy couple of hours just moseying through the",
          "Decided not to bother going into the Popes Palace based on very mixed reviews from trip advisors saying it was hot, empty and devoid of furniture and paintings! Rather walked around the palace and the gardens, very humid after rainfall previous night. Parked for free in the Park",
          "What a gorgeous place to spend a morning or afternoon, wonderful views from all around. There is a cafe at the top which is ok for a snack and drink. Several artists are there which is nice to see them work. Lots of seats in the shade to just sit and relax on a warm day. Free to",
          "A fairly steep ramp up from the left hand side of the front of the Pope's Palace or several flights of fairly steep steps from behind the Palace, take you up to the best viewpoint for the bridge. There are several pleasant walks you can take, shady seats to rest on and a modern",
          "Avignon is a very nice city from Provence. The city is famous due to the Pope's Palace and the ~70 years of catholic administration. But except it's historical past, it is very nice city developed on the Rhone river and rocky hills. The half-bridge is another touristic place.",
          "This is a sloping park up on a high bluff just past the Palais des Papes (Palace of the Popes) & Cathedral, reached by walking up a long wide ramp. This high point is shaded by numerous trees though the main viewing gallery is in the open. Way below is that famous (half) bridge,",
          "Walk uphill from the bottom of the Popes Palace. We took breakfast with us to eat in the park. Great views of Villeneuve Les Avignon fort across the river as well at the famous bridge. You can walk down to the bridge and back into the town which takes you to a nice shopping",
          "After the crowd at the bottom of Palace square, it's nice and quiet up here. The view is perhaps the highest this side of the river ( we did cross the river the next day, it's better on this side high up) The garden, the little pond,the cafe, all inducive to a leisurely stroll",
          "Rocher des doms is very pretty to look at. However, water is water, not a lot you can say really. I suppose its worth a visit, providing it isn't raining.",
          "Great view point of the town and up and across the Rhone valley to Mont Ventoux, Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape etc - no charge!",
          "As mentioned by others, that walk up to the park is a steep one, but so worth it. There is lots of shade to take a breather on the way up and lots to see. The view at the top is exceptional. So much to look at from the river, the bridges, back to the town etc. Definitely",
          "A little oasis of calm with good views over the river and the famous bridge. It's a steep walk so take water and take your time.",
          "A steepish walk up to this park will reward you with stunning views of pont St Benezet and the surrounding countryside. There is a reasonably priced cafe on a duck pond offering ice creams all manner of drinks and food. If you are fit you can push a wheelchair up but there is",
          "Unique garden next to the palais des Papes, mediteran\u00e9e garden, very interesting vues, quite for being in the center",
          "It was a hot sunny day when we visited Palais des Papes. The uphill walk to the Rocher des Doms was a little taxing. The shaded park was therefore a very welcome place to take a break. The views from the terrace to the Rh\u00f4ne and Pont Saint-B\u00e9nezet were incomparable. Relaxing on",
          "Literally folks there was no where to park, anywhere. So we did a drive by of this city and drove to the next town. There is a lot of tour groups so they flood the city leaving no room for anyone else.",
          "Pond with ducks and geese and carp. Hilltop garden with beautiful views of Avignon, the Palais des Papes, the Pont d'Avignon, and the Rhone flowing slowly south through the lush countryside. All is right with the world up here.",
          "It's at the top of a hill, but the walk is worth it. Plenty of seats to relax, a caf\u00e9 for refreshments and great views of the town and famous bridge.",
          "We ascended from the river going up outer wall ramparts. At the top we had beautiful views of the Pont, River, and Old fort across the River. Once you walk into the park it is filled with children playing and a restaurant/bar with all outdoor seating. Lots of nice greenery that",
          "We stumbled upon this excellent hill top park after exiting the Papal Palace. Granted, it's a pretty steep incline up to here, but so worth it! Incredible views of the city and the Rhone. I'd argue you get a better view of the famous Pont d'Avignon from here than anywhere else!",
          "Just a short walk up from the palace, these gardens offer a spectacular view across the river, the bridge and for miles across the surrounding countryside. No charge for entry and very accessible, this beautiful place is an absolute must see when visiting Avignon.",
          "The namesake for the song. A good little rest stop outside the city walls. Must see for all lovers of the Avignon song.",
          "We visited the Rocher des Doms in late May, 2015. The weather was windy that day, but it was still very pleasant. We hiked up from the city walls to the northwest which was a very nice way to enter the park and gave sweeping views down the river. At the top is a garden area,",
          "Only a short uphill walk from the Palais de Papes and you get a terrific view of the city, the midieval walls while enjoying a beautiful park setting. Worth the 15-30 minutes and provides great photo opportunities of the city and surrounding landscape.",
          "I guess I spent way to long to wonder in other towns surrounded by mountains that Avignon as a whole does not look so beautiful geographically. You have fine view from the place but it does not give me the breathtaking hit some places do...",
          "Well worth the visit! The view of the city from the top is really beautiful. Great place for a picnic. Pick up few sandwiches or even better some traditional food from the market (Les Halles) and spend an afternoon here. There is a little cafe that serves food and a little",
          "If you are in the area this is well worth the visit. There is a lot to see inside of the historic walled city. Walk to the top of Rocher des Doms and see a great view. There is a small shop at the park at the top that sells excellent Italian icecream. Don't miss spending an",
          "Buy your food at Les Halles in town, don't forget the wine. Do the hot little trudge up to the top and have a wonderful lunch. By the pond on the top there are some popular picnic tables (arrive at noon to bag the best spot) and they are sheltered by trees from both the sun and",
          "A nice place to have a good view of the entire city. Otherwise it is unremarkable. Advice to spend may be 30 mins or so.",
          "Can be an uphill walk to get a good view of Avignon and the river, but it was worth it when you sit and enjoy nature at the top.",
          "Fantastic views, it's a lovely walk for a coupke or a family. Most parts have stroller friendly ramps so families can enjoy as well. It's free and memorable!!",
          "Beautifully tended gardens, well laid out and a great way to take in the sights of this beautiful city",
          "Other chateaus and ruins were seen as well as the split of the Rhone by the Ile Barthelasse. There is a childs song about the partially completed ( or destroyed) Bridge from Avignon. There is a great view of this bridge from the Rocher. Beautiful walk (uphill but not",
          "This is a lovely park with nice views overlooking the Rhone River and the legendary bridge The Pont St. Benezet. Built in the late 12th century.",
          "This is one of the two places to get the best views over Avignon and the surrounding French countryside, the other being the Pont d'Avignon could be a challenge for some but well worth the effort when you get to take in the view on a clear and sunny day.",
          "Views from Rocher des Dames and the sights of the city make for a great place to visit. Cafes and restaurants abound and there is a great selection of hotels, led by Hotel Garlande which is outstanding in quality and value for money.",
          "A great place f9r viewsvof the bridge and also over the city and the other side of the Rhone. Be aware though, that when thevMistral is blowing it can be a bit rough in the exposed areas but when the wind stops and the temperature rises sun screen is must. Great value cos it's",
          "But it's not worth the fuss that has been created around this place... But as long as you got there... It's a good walk",
          "This is located close to the main square just within the town walls. The view over the river and the partially destroyed bridge is excellent. It's a peaceful place to rest especially in the summer months where there is plenty of shade. A nice restful place to be",
          "Good for views of the area. A pleasant area to sit near a small lake with ducks and a small cafe. Toilet facilities poor.",
          "Close by the Palais des Papes a gently rising walk through well maintained gardens takes you to the Rocher des Doms. Have a coffee at the cafe if you like or simply walk around the perimeter to see the views of Avignon surroundings.",
          "Rocher des Doms is an ideal place to come after going to Les Halles and putting together a picnic. There you can relax on one of the many seats and overlook the Rhone, look back towards the ancient city, or simply enjoy the gardens with its many water features and statues. It's",

          "We were staying in Arles and my wife had always wanted to visit Avignon to see the famous bridge. Looking on Trip Advisor I saw the gardens which is more our thing and offered great views of the bridge. This is a wonderful place to spend a couple of hours. Great vistas and a",
          "Beautiful gardens just a short hike above the Petit Palais and the Palais des Papes. There is a lookout at the top of the hill with a panorama map of the surrounding area, and well as bearings to various towns. There is also a quaint cafe to have tea or a glass of wine. Families",
          "The Rocher de Doms is a beautiful garden immediately behind the Pope's Palace so is easily combined with any visit to that iconic attraction. The gardens are beautiful; it is a wonderfully relaxing, altogether pleasant environment. Fro it, wonderful views of the medieval",
          "Worth the climb on a clear day and 360 degree panorama. Also, a nice place to sit and soak up the sun; good for people watching, too.",
          "well worth a visit for a tranquil few hours and some of the best river and bridge views. The small tourist train runs through it so take that first thing to get your bearings",
          "Very nice place to have a walk with your girl friend. Or simply your family or friends you can see le palais des papes and le pont d avignon from the top. Just an amzing vue",
          "The gardens are loacted very close to the center of the old city. It's a relatively small gardens, but the quiet atmosphere, the green grass, the liitle water pools and the nice view to the river and the rest of the city makes it a good place for carrying a lunch with you and",
          "This is a beautiful garden area, at the crest of the hill, next to the Palais de Papes. Although heavily wooded and gardened, there are view points on all sides, and if you go from one to the other, the area possesses a 360 degree view. You can see for miles. There are a",
          "Avignon, itself, is an attraction in and of itself, but the park next to the Palace of The Popes is not to be missed. Not only does it offer excellent views of the Rhone Valley, the Pont D\"Avignon of nursery rhyme fame, it also offers a view of distant Mont Ventoux, one of",
          "Lots of cool places to explore, a play park for the kids, lots of nice views. Be prepared for stairs. Lots of them.",
          "This is a nice park, existing over different levels. It is probably a lot prettier in spring/summer but it is still worth exploring. We came up via the tower near the Pont Sant Benezet and continued climbing up stairs to the top. The views are wonderful with many different",
          "Don't miss these gardens when you are in the area. Very scenic area with multiple view points across the river. Fantastic view of Pont St. Benezet - great photos!",
          "I didn't think the Pope's palace was open so I walked up the hill ( quite a hill!) and discovered the wonderful views and gardens. While there, I saw vehicles with \"people movers\" (or whatever they are called) coming along - no doubt for people on guided tours. Along the edge",
          "Beautiful park to wander in, especially after a meal or visiting the Pont d'Avignon. Lots of steps if you are accessing it from the lower area.",
          "Amble up the paths to this area and you will be rewarded wityh views of the famous Pont d'Avignon, historic sites across the Rhone, and s good bit of the city and its walls. From here one can walk down toward the river, along the only part of the ramparts open to foot traffic,",
          "We took the train close to the Pope's palace to climb the rock. The ponds and the gardens are lovely. But the best is the amazing view in the bridge and Mt Ventoux.",
          "We have been here twice now, we went one of the first years we came to Avignon and then went this year again. We took my parents in law up and they loved it. It is a bit of a walk but it is worth it. The views to the Rhone and the bridge are amazing. The gardens also have",

          "It's a great garden and view. You could view the river from the top. Great place for couples or family with kids. :)",
          "The gardens themselves are very well laid out, but not worth a trip but the views are - you can see for miles, and understand why Avignon has been strategically important since the stone age.",
          "Excellent walk from the river to the top! And then were rewarded with the great garden views. We actually stumbled on this as we took our own walk. I just read where you can get a slef-guided tour online. I should have read my fellow writers to Trip Advisor!",
          "We might not have come here but for a taxi driver who recommended these gardens. A steady but gentle climb from the Palais des Papes takes you to a superb view over the river and the far bank right up to the garrigue hills. There's also a curious sundial where you yourself",
          "Climb up the hill behind the cathedral to the lovely gardens with grottoes and waterfalls and sit relax for a while, taking in the stunning views. The little cafe is very good, with a kiddies play area nearby. Take the steps down towards the river for the free ferry across to",
          "The park is small and it took less than 30 min. to walk around. The park is on hill and the view of landscape was good. It is better to go to park from museum side, center of the city. If you go from the river, you have to climb up the hill.",
          "The gardens, water features, cafe and children areas are excellent, but what the garden has best is its views out over the Rhone and across the city. A great place to relax and chill out. Please note that you cannot access the Pont d'Avignon from the steps, but they will take",
          "This was one of many attractions in the walled city of Avignon. Hard to select sometimes but would encourage the walk here.",
          "Must include on your walking tour, but this isn't the highlight. Great views from the various lookouts. Why not download the app \"city walks\" and choose the orientation self-guided walk on Avignon? Basic version is free, for a few dollars you can get version that shows you the",
          "This hill take you behind the popes palace and you can have a good view of the city. If you have time and do not mind walking up hill then it is a place to go and send some time.",
          "This is a lovely place to visit with ponds, waterfalls, landscaping and an incredible view from the top of the Rhone river and Avignon. This is a great place to visit and plan to spend some time to wander and take in the enjoyment of the place.",
          "Its a half bridge, close to Palais du Pl. Nice surrounding of old palace, park and river. You can click photos from below the bridge while being on the road also. If you want to go on the top of the bridge then pay 5 euro per head. Entrance is just below the bridge on the palace",
          "This is a lovely place to visit if you're in Avignon. Besides the Pope's palace, this is worth a walk and there are some great photo opportunities as you walk towards the river. Parents with children have to be careful though, as safety measures are insufficient.",
          "Save yourself to long walk up the driveway and use the stairs near the the Popes Palace. There is a small cafe in the garden or you can get a sandwich in town. Climb up and enjoy a relaxing lunch and great views of the river. The gardens are closed at night. TIP: If you are",

          "In the midst of baking Avignon, this park is a lovely oasis. So many trees and places to sit, plus a little pond (with lots of ducks) and great view and breeze too. It's well worth a visit for a different 'view' of Avignon.",
          "And near the grotto, the shady biergarten with the fountains, ducks, playing children, and cold drinks was wonderful on a sunny day, too!",
          "This beautiful garden is very close to the Palais des Papes and is certainly worth seeing. There are several \"view\" spots that look out over the Rhone River.",
          "It is a pleasant up hill stroll that takes you from the hustle of the Papal Palace to a quiet green park above the city. A cool Breeze from the river below never felt so good! The views are worth it and the gardens are delightful. Local sculpture celebrates local celebrities",
          "Yes, it's cool that this is the bridge in the old song, and yes, you get cool views. But - you can get nice views from other areas in the city, and see the bridge as you drive past. If you are short on time, I don't think this is a must see.",
          "Of course, we loved the views of the two rivers above Avignon and its iconic partial bridge. We also enjoyed the little kids on wheeled vehicles who could really get up a good head of steam on the paved paths. There's a rental spot for super trikes that look like horses and",
          "From her you get fabulous views over the Pont D'Avigon, River Rhone and across to Villeneuve-les-Avignon on the other side of the river. There are benches to sit and admire the views and plenty of greenery for shade. It is a great way to get a good overview of Avignon.",
          "After visiting Palais des Papes - take a walk up the hill (it is a haul) The view is breathtaking. There is a lot of greenery - there are benches - if you don't have your own bottle of water, there is a snack shack (that I am sure is crazy expensive, but it is there if",
          "My wife and I climbed up to the top of this lookout point in Avignon almost as soon as we got to the city. It allows for views of almost 100% of the city from high above. When you are walking through the skinny city streets you might not get a real feeling for the city, but",
          "FYI the beautiful view of the bridge is from the hill above. To walk out onto the bridge, there is a fee. We opted not to pay since we were on a tight schedule in Avignon. I would imagine the view of the city is great from there.",
          "When you visit the Papal Palace, buy the joint ticket to include this famous bridge. Of course, why its famous is all down to childhood songs, but the key is the audio tour. Its really good. Engaging, historical and well timed. Standing in the middle of the mighty Rhone river",
          "It's easy to find - just keep going up hill from the square in front of the Popes' Palace - but not much signing. If you didn't know it was there, or that there was something worth the extra climb on top, you would not know you had missed something good. It has ramps as an",
          "Great view of Villenueve, the bridge and Avignon. But go in the morning when the lighting is better for pictures. Two ways u can go up, if u wanna see more pretty trees and flowerd, take the windy steps. If you just wanna go direct to the view, take the road to the left. Tou can",
          "Avignon is cute and worth a look for sure - you can get a great view of the city and surrounding areas from Rocher des Doms. Personally I would save yourself the 5 euro entrance fee for walking onto the bridge and instead get the free passenger ferry to Ile de Barthelasse",
          "This lovely park is right next to the Papal Palace. It has excellent views of the city, Avignon Bridge, the rivers and of the Papal Plaza. There are seated areas, fountains, small cafes and stalls as well as plenty for children. The central grotto is great for children and",

          "A lovely walk past the popes palace with great places for chatting and taking in the spectacular views. Sunset from here is simply breathtaking. A playground and grotto exist as well. So take your time and soak it all in . Free of charge",
          "This is a standout attraction if you are staying in or visiting Avignon with young children. There are few green public parks within the city walls, making Rocher des Doms all the more valuable. Kids can run around, check out the fish in the grotto, enjoy the playground or burn",
          "Avignon is a walled-in and densely populated city; this is the nicest park in the city; and the highest point and best place to take in the vistas. A visit to Avignon is not complete without a stop here.",
          "The views are great over the town, river and distant hills. It's a bit scruffy and the loos are dire so go to a cafe first! We take all our visitors there and everyone enjoys the trip. It is uphill but easily so.",
          "On top of the cliffs above the Rhone, Rocher des Doms faces Villeneuve-lez-Avignon across the river. The gardens and spacious panoramic terraces can be reached by the steps leading from the Cathedral Notre Dame des Doms, by steps from the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne, or via the",
          "Le Rocher des Domes it's a garden right next door to the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Domes. It is free to visit but I believe it closes by 7 p.m. It is a really enjoyable place and if you're visiting Avignon in a hot sunny day it is a nice place to find a shadow and to rest a",
          "A piece of history, something that people go to see when travelling to Provence. Average attraction, nothing special, but OK. Visited in summer 2004.",
          "Lovely park overlooking the city, the Rhone & tributaries and the entire area with duck pond, caf\u00e9 & play equipment for kids.",
          "Well worth the 10 minute walk up from the Popes Palace with stunning views over the Rhone and Pont d'Avignon, and it's free. Go on a windy day for the full experience!",
          "Take a romantic stroll through this park and then settle in for a picnic from goodies you've picked up from all the delicious food and wine available in town. Lovely view over the Rhone too. Lots of benches to perch.",
          "It is worth walking up. Very nice view from above. If do do not want to walk, the tourist train could bring you there. Train ride starts from a square in front of Pope's Palace.",
          "Very much worth to go up there for the beauty and breathless view of the region.If weather is clement enough, blue sky you can see all surrending including the Mont Ventoux, Aix en Provence,Chateauneuf du Pape. Good tips for couple while tourring the park and feeling romantic,",
          "If you don't get blown away by the powerful wind, this is a must see in Avignon. Views of the Rhone valley including the famous Pont St Benezet are excellent, and the park itself is pleasant and fun to explore.",
          "I went early in the morning so it was quiet. The views are breathtaking and there is a lot of interesting information on various signs. You can see Chateauneuf du Pape from there. Lots of benched to sit and look at the views. Nice way to escape the busy streets",
          "A gorgeous spot to wander around in. A very gentle walk up a hill (not steep) to a lovely big area with dick ponds, gardens, cafe & gorgeous views",
          "Beautiful gardens, nice ramps, stunning views over \"Le Rh\u00f4ne\" and Avignon most famous bridge. At the top there is a nice caf\u00e9 under the trees by the pond. A very pleasant walk, perfect location for some extra pictures. Worth doing it",
          "Lovely view of the Rhone and the surrounding countryside including Mont Ventoux (Chapeau Chris Froome!) in the distance. Sue's watercolour bit & bobs got blown away by the wind mid painting",
          "Worth the effect of a few steep steps and you get a free view of the Pont Saint Benezet, plus a nice garden to walk around at the top!",
          "Climb up the one hundred plus steps to get some great views of the area and some good photo's. There is no entry fee for this one unlike to go out on the bridge.",

          "This park is adjacent to the Palais des Papes and is a quick and easy walk to a hilltop overlooking the Rhone, Pont d'Avignon, and old city. There's also a nice little grotto/waterfall in the middle of the park.",
          "This was well worth an evening walk for the stunning 360 degree views of Avignon . It gets dark so late so we were up there quite late enjoying the light.",
          "It's OK as a park but I think the real worth of the Rocher is as a starting point to get the big picture of how Avignon is laid out and take in the lovely views of the old bridge and Villeneuve d'Avignon on the other side of Rh\u00f4ne which has two arms here because of the island.",
          "Take the time to visit this small park. You can take only a few minutes to visit or even a whole day and have lunch there.",
          "Lovely views of the surrounding countryside and of the rivers. Gardens are nice, but not spectacular.",
          "Absence of civilised toilets was unexpected. It is worth the effort to make the climb either from the river or from the Palais Square for the fine views.",
          "We strolled up to the park from behind the Palais des Papes and the cathedral. The walk uphill is windy and a bit steep, but not too arduous. The little tram also services the hilltop if you are not inclined to walk. The park itself is very multifaceted, with rose",
          "The Roches des Doms made a great and relaxing follow up to the visit to the Palais des Papes. The climb up is easy and the views are stunning. There is a beautiful grotto type rock face and pool, children's playground and wide spaces for children to play. It was certainly well",
          "We went up straight from the river and it was an enduring walk up there, though we wouldn't have missed it for the world. The view is very nice and relaxing. The park has a small playing area, a nice lake with a beautiful statue and some kind of a cave-like waterfall with ducks",
          "It's just a simple garden behind the Popes' Palace but well worth the climb up the hill for the view over the Rhone. There is also a very good little cafe up there where we had a great crepe Grand Marnier.",
          "This is a great outdoor space and should not be missed. It is the highest point in the city and can be accessed from near the Notre Dame Cathedral or a couple of places near the City Walls. There are panoramic views from many places in the Park, including unexpectedly from the",

          "The only true green park within the walls of arid Avignon, the Rocher des Doms offers an escape from the heat in the summer and a clear view toward distant sights in Provence and Languedoc during the mistral-swept winter and spring. There are cafes and ice cream and rides for",
          "It's always nice to break up a day of town walking with a bit of greenery. The entrance to the gardens is past the Papal Palace and Notre-Dame-des-Doms, so you get a chance to see the outside of the buildngs on your way in. Unfortunately, as you cross the courtyard in front of",
          "Worth the hike up the hill. Stunning views of the Rhone, Avignon, Villaneuve lez Avignon and Mont Ventoux. Many photos ops. The garden is a retreat separating you from the city. A quiet spot for lovers, friends, and families. Linger if you have the time.",

          "The views from the Rocher des Doms are great, but the thing my kids loved was the pedal-powered contraptions available for hire on weekends, Wednesday afternoons and holidays. Smaller kids can get around in a kind of trotting gig with wheeled horse out front, while older kids",
          "Nice park. Smaller than I expected it to be, but interesting and good views. At least it wasn't as steep and far to get to the top as I was expecting.",
          "We found these gardens more beautiful and worthwhile than the interior of Palais des Papes. Pretty views of the surrounding area, including across the Rhone. They also have a little sandwich shop at the top. There are a lot of stairs so it was a decent walk.",
          "Beautiful park next to the Palais de Papes, worth a walk thru and a great spot to watch the sunset. There is a restaurant in the middle, but it was closed when we were there on a Tuesday.",

          "We visited the gardens most evenings to make use of the busy little children's playground that is there suitable for under 8's. It was really pleasant walking up to the gardens in the evenings when the worst of the heat was leaving the day. The views are fantastic from the",
          "A nice and relaxing place to visit if you need a break from your busy trip. Here you can find a nice bench for a relaxing picnic lunch (french style) with a great view of Rh\u00f4ne and watching people. If you need a place to relax and enjoy your vacation, this is one of them.",
          "Hot day. Ascended, passing the Cathedrale to Rocher des Doms, a Park popular and sometimes busy spot on a high spur of rock with interesting views and attractions. Yet, we found a place to sit and watch the ducks or lay on the grass under the trees and have a nap.",
          "Nice area worth the steep walk up (even steeper on a hot day!) for a look around and to admire the views. You can see almost all of the surrounding city from various areas, there are also some nice water features and a small cafe to relax in shade from the heat.",
          "We visited Rocher des Doms on a hot July morning. The walk up is quite steep but the views you get when you are up there are superb. We were also extremely grateful for the cooling breeze. It is a pleasant area to visit with things to interest every age group. Well worth a",
          "This lovely park was the original site where Neolithic man first settled on the banks of the Rhone River at what would become the city of Avignon. With it's proximity to water and defensive heights high above the surrounding area, it's easy to see why early man chose this spot.",
          "If you have just spent a few hours visiting The Popes Palace you will need somewhere to sit down and relax and this will do the job nicely, although you could always have a drink and a meal in one of the open air restaurants in the square but that will cost you, the park won't",

          "If you get a clear day this is a must do in Avignon. Spectacular!",
          "The view that the Rocher des Doms offers you on top of the hill is just amazing. It is a very nice place to chill out with family or friends. It only lacks a real nice caf\u00e9 (the one already there is not worth it)",
          "Beautiful panoramic views of the Rhone and the St Benezet Bridge.. great place to stroll and enjoy being in France!",
          "Skip the entrance fee for the Pont St. Benezet and just climb the rocher. Great 360 degree views and plenty of beautiful spots for lunch!",
          "I decided not to pay to stand on the bridge but viewed it from the street.",
          "Try to visit late in the afternoon, just before the park closes. The view of the Rhone and its valley is breathtaking",

          "A bit of a hike, but worth it- gorgeous views of the bridge, and countryside beyond.",

        "wiki": "The Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais is a museum and art gallery in Avignon, southern France.  It opened in 1976 and has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.  It is housed in a 14th-century building at the north side of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes.\n\n\n== Building ==\nNamed Petit Palais to distinguish it from the Palais des Papes, the original structure was built during the period of the Avignon Papacy by Cardinal B\u00e9renger Fredoli the Elder in around 1318\u201320.  The palace and a few neighbouring buildings were bought on de Fr\u00e9dol's death in 1323 by Cardinal Arnaud de Via, nephew of the reigning Pope John XXII. When de Via died in 1335 Pope Benedict XII bought the building for use as the episcopal palace. The subsequent building work created an interior close to that of the present configuration with four wings around a cloister and a service court.The building suffered during its use from 1396 as a fortified citadel during the Western Schism, and was a wreck by the time the war ended in 1411.  In the second half of the 15th century, Bishop Alain de Co\u00ebtivy and his successor, Giuliano della Rovere (the future Pope Julius II) carried out restoration work, giving the Palace more or less its present appearance by 1503.  Della Rovere arrived in Avignon in 1474, having been made bishop of Avignon and papal legate of Avignon by his uncle Pope Sixtus IV.  He added new south and west facades in Italian Renaissance style (with oculi, a west-facing door surmounted with a triangular pediment, window drip-moldings and his insignia facing south) and, in 1487, a tower (which collapsed in 1767).  The Palace became known as the Palace of the Archbishop when the city was promoted to an archbishopric soon after della Rovere took office.\nDuring the French Revolution, the palace was nationalised and sold off, becoming a Catholic secondary school in 1826 and then in 1904, with the separation of the church and the state, a professional and technical school. The building was listed as a historic monument in 1910. The restoration work, began in 1961, was supervised by Jean Sonnier, the chief architect of the Monument historique, the national heritage organization in France. The building opened as a museum in 1976.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n390 works by Italian (327) and French primitive or early-Renaissance painters such as Sandro Botticelli (Madonna with Child, c. 1467) or Vittore Carpaccio.\n600 sculptures including the effigy head from the tomb of Antipope Clement VII; the rest of the tomb was destroyed during the French Revolution.\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\n\n==== 13th and 14th centuries ====\nSimone Martini, Paolo Veneziano, Lippo Memmi, Taddeo Gaddi, Agnolo Gaddi (The Calvary), Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Bartolo di Fredi, Giovanni Baronzio, Lorenzo di Bicci, Master of 1310, Jacopo del Casentino, Mariotto di Nardo, Jacopo di Cione, Puccio di Simone, Paolo di Giovanni Fei, Turino Vanni, Barnaba da Modena (workshop), Simone dei Crocifissi, Angelo Puccinelli, Girolamo Marchesi, Niccolo di Pietro Gerini, Niccol\u00f2 di Tommaso, Francescussio Ghissi.\n\n\n==== 15th and 16th centuries ====\nSandro Botticelli (Madonna with Child), Vittore Carpaccio (Sacred conversation),  Lorenzo Monaco, Carlo Crivelli, Vittorio Crivelli, Sano di Pietro, Matteo di Giovanni, Benvenuto di Giovanni, Taddeo di Bartolo, Andrea di Bartolo, Benozzo Gozzoli, Lorenzo di Credi (workshop), Antonio Vivarini, Bartolomeo Vivarini, Liberale da Verona, Pesellino, Jacopo del Sellaio, Neri di Bicci, Cima da Conegliano, Vecchietta, Giovanni di Paolo, Jacopo di Paolo, Cosimo Rosselli, Ludovico Mazzolino, Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, Giovanni da Udine, Biagio di Antonio Tucci, Benvenuto di Giovanni,  Bartolomeo Veneto, Ambrogio Bergognone, Francesco Botticini, Antoniazzo Romano, Bonifacio Bembo, Marco Palmezzano, Bernardino Fungai, Master of Tavarnelle, Louis Br\u00e9a or from the Avignon school Josse Lieferinxe and Enguerrand Quarton.\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\nThe collection features Romanesque sculpted capitals from the churches of Avignon notably from the cloister of the Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame des Doms (12th c.), pieces of funerary monuments of the papal period (14th c.) like those of John XXII, Innocent VI, Urban V or the cardinals Philippe de Cabassole and Jean de La Grange (1388-\u201389), as well as sculptures of the school of Avignon (15th c.) with Antoine Le Moiturier or Jean de la Huerta.\n\nItalian paintings\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGirard, Joseph (1958). \u00c9vocation du Vieil Avignon.

          "You get an view of papal history in the region in this not overly large museum. We particularly like the peace and quiet of museum cafe located in a high-walled quadrangle.",
          "Interesting Church art. Limited English descriptions made it hard to fully appreciate for non-French speakers. However, there is no admission fee and it is worth the hour stop.",
          "The Petit Palais in Avignon was built during the period of the Avignon Papacy by Cardinal Berenger Fredoli the Elder in around 1318\u201320 and in 1335 became the Archbishop's Palace. The interior today is much as it was then and houses an impressive collection of religious art from",
          "This is a great museum, located beside the Pope's Palace. Located within a 14th-century building, the museum features an impressive collection of over 325 Renaissance paintings and sculptures in Avignon as well as Italy. Admission is reasonable. Admission to ages 11 and under",

          "This is a small museum and it is free. They have so m.j e beautiful medieval art pieces. I particularly enjoyed seeing the 5 Botticelli art pieces. Definitely worth seeing once you have visited the Palace of the Popes.",
          "If nothing else, the air conditioning in August is exceedingly welcome. But it is also a very solid museum. Multiple floors, but easy to get around and there aren't many visitors. It is a nice, relaxing experience.",
          "Wonderful mobile interactive video of how the Palais looked in the 17th century handed to every visitor. Also terrific views from the top of the Palais.",

          "When you get done with the Pope's palace, walk next door to this museum. It's small but the collection is very well curated and it's free! Very interesting to see some of the other artwork available that used to adorn the palace and wonder at the artistry of so long ago.",
          "Wide ranging tours are offered in the Palace that each show different aspects of the Pope's palace. A fair amount of walking (some steep) is required, but well worth it!",
          "Whether interested in the palace or its Italian religious art or sheltering from the Mistral wind or the sun, it is an interesting place to go. It also has nice toilets.",

          "Across the square, a few minutes from the Palais des Papes, is a gem of a museum with a beautiful tea garden. Alongside the many religious paintings there are frescoes from a house in Sorgue over 600 years old and some remaining wall painting from the palace itself. The final",

          "This small art gallery is well worth the time and few euros entry fee. The gallery contains a number of good examples of Italian religious art from the 1300\u2019s but what really made it worthwhile was the few Botticelli paintings. As there are no boundaries between you and the",

          "We visited this museum on our last day and it was worth the wait. Although its name suggests its a small museum there is lots of wonderful religious paintings to see. It is very well displayed, our only criticism was that there was not an English paper guide in each room to read",
          "I usually skip religious art sections but the visit has changed my opinion about it. Very interesting to see how the painters struggled with perspective and started to work it out, how landscapes got into religious paintings and how it changes your perception actually \u263a Really",
          "Even though it is all religious art the quality is very good and the paintings are clean. Easy to follow the exhibits up and down the various floors.",
          "I am not normally a fan of churchy gothic art but this place was fabulous. They kicked us out at lunchtime but allowed us back in after 2 pm. I can only comment on the art as I skipped everything else. See if you can spot John the Baptist wearing a short dress.",

          "A nice museum with lots of artwork to see and some information boards in other languages (English, German, Italian), just a shame we had to rush it as we did this on our last day. We had attempted to visit earlier but it's closed on Tuesdays.",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each.

Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

          "This is an incredible palace, full of history and huge in size. Avignon itself is a walled city on the edge of the Rhone River, and the Palace sits just a few meters away from the river. Be prepared for a bit of a hike, the palace is quite large and it is spread across multiple",
          "This cathedral is next to the Palace of the Popes in Avignon, and worth a visit when you have finished your exploration of the very interesting and worthwhile palace.",
          "The cathedral is in someways surprisingly small given its proximity to the Pope's Palace, but probably the chapel in the palace actually received more atttention. Entry was free.",
          "Built in the mid-12th century, damaged many times and rebuilt. In the 15th C, the large bell tower was rebuilt, and in the 19th C, an imposing statue of the Madonna was added. A romanesque dome that covers the transept crossing is remarkable. A great view from the outside.",
          "A rather usual, smaller church attached to the Papal palace area. I didn't find much of distinction(but on my tour I've seen about 11 churches in 7 days-9 of them Norte Dames). But do go if you are next door or your n the area-it does have historical significance in the area!",
          "Outside the cathedral is more interesting than inside. I'm not sure it deserves the visit. It is next to the Papal Palace.",
          "We just had time to take a quick look, no guide. It is a great building, but nothing extra ordinary.",
          "If you're visiting the Pope's Palace you ought to pop in here too. Not the most stunning, opulent, vast or generally impressive cathedral in France, but it has some interesting bits and pieces and puts the Palace into perspective. Worth a short (both distance and time) detour.",
          "The relatively simple church attached to the papal palace seems bare, but it has tremendous architectural bones. There is also some noteworthy art inside and it's free to enter.",
          "This big church is in the area next to the Palais so easy to stop in and enjoy. Very large and majestic - we went in while mass was being said so we didn't stay long.",
          "Same period as Palais des Papes but it's been extended and renovated over the centuries. There are a couple of important artworks inside.",
          "A lovely, relatively small cathedral adjacent to the massive Papal Palace. Topped by a glittering gilded statue of the Virgin Mary, and with several side chapels, including one with the grave of Pope Benedict XII and the mausoleum of Pope John XXII. A steep climb up a long",
          "The gilded statue of the Virgin Mary on top is one of the landmarks of Avignon. At first, the interior looks rather dull. But it takes some time and patience to discover the real beauty of the building. Quite a mix of different styles and periods. Interesting works of art,",
          "This cathedral is surprisingly unspectacular, considering its location next to the Palais du Papes. On the plus side you can visit it, most major churches I attempted to visit were closed.",
          "The cathedral is in the vicinity of the Pope's palace. The building itself is impressive and also the interior is worth seeing. There are two tombs of popes inside and quite a lot of statues and paintings.",
          "Another European church, I know....but this one stands next to the papal palace on a rise, so the views are stunning of the river and bridge on one side, and the palace on the other. The adjacent park is a good place to relax and people-watch.",
          "The facade and the small square in front of the cathedral are very interesting and beautiful. The interior is the regular french cathedral, prerry but nothing out of the ordinary.",
          "This is a really historic building, with many significant changes to the use and occupancy. Sadly much of the history is just touched upon and not explored in depth. Worth a visit if you are in Avignon, make sure you get the ticket that allows entrance to the bridge as well.",
          "The cathedral is overshadowed by the Palais des Papes, and is easy to miss. Nevertheless, you should take a look at its interiors, unusual. Don't miss the oldest part of the church, in pure Roman style with the period baptismal font as you enter.",
          "Take time to walk around and take in every angle! Walk to the overlook at the river. Take a moment to savor the sounds at the main plaza in front of the church. Beautiful church in a beautiful city!!",
          "Be sure and visit this lovely cathedral adjacent to the Palais des Papes. Admission is free and it is the perfect location for quiet meditation and prayer.",
          "This is a very stunning church above the Pope's Palace; and in my opinion a better option. Also the park and views from the park are stunning.",
          "A very nice cathedral which you should visit if you have time. Not a destination cathedral but near the Pope's Palace and worth a stop. Perhaps I was expecting more since it is in teh city where a number of Popes lived in teh middle Ages.",
          "It is a very beautiful building. Also don't forget to visit the park nest to it. Also the river is nice and also the smell in the air",
          "This small cathedral is next to the Palace of the Popes. The stained glass windows are beautiful & so are the chapels. The gardens next door are a must visit as the views from there are stunning. You can see for miles in 3 directions from the gardens.",
          "The cathedral is not large and massive. It is, nonetheless, a thing of beauty. The church and its chapels inside are stunning. We were in awe at so much beauty in such a relatively small cathedral. By the point of time we visited during our two weeks in France, we had already",
          "It's tiny but beautiful from the inside and outside! and make sure you visit the park right next to it!!",
          "Again, although we have visited many churches on our trip to France, it is worth the visit. There is so much history inside the church.",
          "This is not the most attractive cathedral in France, by a long way, compared with, say, Tours or Chartres. However, it does provide some context for the Palais next door and the building is a wonderful contribution to the world heritage site.",
          "A bit underwhelming - but this was the church of the people, who weren't allowed into the Palais next door. Likewise, the Popes never used this church, they had a private chapel for the 500 or so inhabitants of the Palais. Still a couple of Popes are buried here and it is a",
          "This cathedral is located next to the Popes Palace and overlooking the cobblestoned square. It is impressive from the outside given its Romanesque style of architecture. It was originally built in the second half of the 12th century but has been renovated a few times since.",
          "You should certainly visit Notre Dame des Doms, which is next to the Pope's Palace, its grandeur will impress you",
          "The quiet in this church is well respected so it was a good place to sit and be still, particularly as public seating is rather limited in the large squares outside. The emphasis is very much on the Popes who were based here so it doesn't really have the cosy parish feel, rather",
          "This is a lovely Cathedral but is situated right next door to the popes palace and very often gets overlooked as visitors concentrate on its larger neighbour and the bridge d'avignon which are available on a joint ticket. Not the most magnificent nor the largest Cathedral but",
          "This church was described very flatteringly by our Guide so we went there. However, it was not pretty or otherwise interesting.",
          "Saw this on a day trip from Marseille. Well worth the 120 plus steps, it has some of the best views in Southern France, and the church is magnificent! Put this on the list!",
          "at the summer, the sunlight will so long until 8pm so really good place for you to take the photos full of sunshine, beautiful garden, full of flowers,",
          "Was closed when we were around and it did not feel like worth a wait until it opens. Nice from outside, though not impressing or anything, and from the pictures it seems to reflect the inside",
          "Cathedrale Notre-Dame des Doms next to the Pope's Palace and frequently overlooked by visitors or assumed as part of the palace. If time permit, take time to visit the cathedral and the magnificent statues in front. The photo taking of the frontage may prove difficult",
          "A huge cathedral since the France under Roman occupation, a Romanesque and a symbol of papal power that makes Avignon the center of it all, from political, religious and economic might.",
          "An absolutely beautiful church with wonderful works of art. However, be careful how you time your visit as it closes at 1pm (we never did find out if it re-opens!)",
          "quite the building-you can't miss it as it dominates the skyline. classic,old-a true European beauty. great photo subject",
          "I am not Catholic (Protestant) but decided to dress appropriately and attend part of the mass. First time for me and it was special. Also the beautiful sound of the clock chiming before every 15 minutes. It is a pity that some tourists do not show enough respect during the",
          "Another place to visit when in the city. No Entrance Fee but but has strange opening times. We walked up the steps to go in but the doors were shut, as we stood there the doors were opened by the local administrator. Bit luck as there were no indcations on what times it was open.",
          "The outside crucifixion is impressive as is the Madonna on top. Ut inside is fairly plain, we went to Sunday mass here and afterwards the priest shook hands with everyone on the way out which was a nice touch.",
          "This is one big church! the exterior beauty is surpassed only by the interior. The vaulted arches are beautiful and the carvings are very detailed. It gives one a feeling of peace",
          "I am sure that its proximity to the Pope's Palace added historical significance to this building but I couldn't get anyone to explain what it was. It is an active church so access is occasionally limited or closed altogether. The statue on the pedestal outside is visible from",
          "It is still worth going inside to see this cathedral. It is not ornate or too over-the-top. The interior is quite lovely.",
          "It is quite nice. Quiet, a nice place is offered for those who want to offer a prayer. You can take a few nice photos here. Worth seeing. No admission charge.",
          "We tried to get inside on a Sunday morning but the doors were locked. However, we returned at about four o'clock just as a service was ending so we were able to see the interior. However, a notice on the door stated that it would be closed for all of the following week. The",
          "Next to the Palais des Papes you find Cathedral Notre-Dame des Doms. It is all you hope for and wish from a Catholic cathedral. It is quite and serene. It is beautiful art. Very relaxing. We were lucky to be there when they were playing some baroque music which was absolutely",
          "A few minutes walk from the Pope's Palace is the Avignon Notre-Dame. Sometimes you can visit inside, it is worth the attempt. The large, gilded statue on top can be seen from all over the city.",
          "Unfortunately, when I visited the cathedral was not open to visitors. I think it is under renovations. However it is impressive from the outside as it sits on a high point in the city next to the Pope's Palace and has impressive views.",
          "After visiting the Palais des Papes, the Cathedrale Notre-Dame des Doms, is worth a look given it\u2019s next door. Our tour group was fortunate enough to see the inside of this church, and we feasted our eyes on the exterior and grounds. There is the beautiful golden statue of our",

          "This cathedrals has been under renovation and was due to open in April 2015 but remains closed with no date of opening",
          "You\u2019re surely going to visit the Palais des Papes while you\u2019re in Avignon, so you might as well have a look at its next door neighbor, the Cathedrale Notre-Dame des Doms, while you're there. Our tour group wasn\u2019t fortunate enough to see the inside of this magnificent church, but",
          "Very busy place. Lines can get long if you go at the wrong time. Go early to get inside for a viewing.",
          "We visited this cathedral a while back and had mass in it. A bit dark inside other ways nice, have seen better ones.",
          "The church was not open for us to see, but walking up to the top of the grounds was a great view. The view was worth the walk up.",
          "Sadly this was closed so we were unable to go inside but it looks beautiful from the outside and I'm sure it would be gorgeous inside - check when it will re-open if you really want to view it. Lovely views from the terrace and gardens beyond.",
          "Since I could not get in, I have only photos from the outside to show . Since you are not going there without visiting the Palais and further on the Pont , make sure your timing is right",
          "Again, the view from the outside is wonderful. I had no reason to go inside... But that might be the case for other visitors. I strolled around the place aoround the cathedrale.",
          "More stunning architecture and grounds. If you're at the Pope's Palace you literally can't miss walking over to it. Some great views after the steps of the city and river and square in front of the palace.",
          "Lovely from the outside with some nice statues. We could not go inside as it is being renovated. If you walk up to the top you get a great view of all the Statues.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful from the outside it was getting restored when I went but even from the outside its breath taking",
          "Stunning place the gardens are a must. Lots of steps but the view is stunning. Well worth the visit inside and out of Place du Palais",
          "I usually go there with groups of tourists and I find this church pretty amazing! Beautiful and simple yet must see.",
          "If it's boiling hot and you need to get out of the sun for a couple hours, this is a great thing to do. It's worth buying the audio guide and you can purchase tickets on line and then queue barge when you arrive. Great views of town and fascinating history of Avignon",
          "Unable to go inside because of maintainence. Just able to see the outside and looks classical. Outside it provide a good view of the city.",
          "I'm gonna talk just about the tower visit.To me this was a little bit disappointing. Maybe was my fault. I thought this would be in my top 3 cathedrals but is not. Is not as good as St Paul's or San Pietro, and of course not even near to Sagrada Familia. You have no guides at",
          "Beautiful on the outside, but the inside takes your breath away. The gold madonna is visible for miles and information on the history of the church is available inside. Be sure to see the small area which was the original site from the 500's.",
          "So disappointed that the cathedral was closed for refurbishment and won't reopen until next year. Looks great from the outside,",
          "This area oozes history and culture. To see the walled city and dine in one of the many cafe's makes for a truly unforgettable trip",
          "In the same large Place du Palais that belonged at the times to the Avignon Papacy and now is a beautiful public space, we found the gorgeous cathedral of Avignon, called Cathedral Notre-Dame des Doms.It is a Roman Catholic cathedral and a national monument of France. It is",
          "good for walking around and taking photos. didnt go inside, but outside look is good enough, the view during sunset is also beautiful",
          "Not able to enter the Church as renovations are being done but this is a beautiful structure and stands right next to the Palais des Papes",
          "It is an opportunity that costs nothing to view this massive building and gardens. Takes up a couple of blocks.The beauty of the site just makes you feel serene. Stop and rest!",
          "Several of the churches I planned on seeing in Provence were closed. This was one of them. Very disappointing, as it was a reputed to be Black Madonna church and I had made a special effort to visit Avignon. I hope I can return to France again before I die. The outside of the",
          "This cathedral stands just on the left side of the Palais du Popes and you'll easily reconize it for the gilded image of the Virgin on the top of the church. The entrance has no fee and the church is opened from about 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The church as it is today is dated from",
          "I prayed here on my first trip to Avignon and had my favors answered. I keep coming back. It's a special place for me :)",
          "we entered more to escape from the heat, but we also appreciated the silence and peace we found here, apart from the crowds outside",
          "perfect to pop in just to chill out as it is quite cool. free entry apart from the quite abundant and apparently obligatory beggars",
          "A wonderful experience of early Christianity! The church is very old & fits in with Avignon and the surrounds. I just marvel at the history.",
          "This cathedral is small, surprisingly so given that the popes once celebrated Mass here. But it's charming, set high on the hill, with a stunned gold leaf statue of the Virgin Mary on top. You can access the cathedral by ramp or steps. Be sure to visit the nearby gardens, for",
          "Not much to recommend this church. Outside of the beautiful golden statue of our Lady of Notre Dame on the steeple, this church could be any one of hundreds of Churchs in France. Inside is dark and not spectacular at all. If pressed for time, skip this one.",
          "We attended a wonderful and spiritual French Mass on Pentecost and after Mass visited the church and various chapels. Perhaps, because Mass had just ended there was more than enough light to take in the architecture and beauty of this cathedral. There is no cost except to light",
          "Another of the great cathedrals which while impressive, is quite dark inside. It does have though beautiful stained glass windows. Its best features for me were outside. It has a beautiful golden statue of Notre Dame Our Lady on top which soars over the Cathedral. At the front",
          "The cathedral is a beautiful calm retreat from the hectic pace of Avignon.It has an amazing feel to it as soon as you enter it's doors wonderful history and so nice to be able to light candle in memory of departed family and friends",
          "Visit it and you can sing Sur la pont d'Avignon, but nut really worth the expense just to see the chapel. Just as impressive from the river bank",
          "I was almost put off going by a recent review but I'm glad I did make the effort. This is one of the few free things in Avignon and it is quite quiet as I imagine few people get there. The interior is really beautiful and there are some beautiful stained glass windows (see",

          "After the magnificence of the Palais des Papes next door this was a little disappointing, dark and with little information. I suppose it is a retreat from the bustle of the rest of the city and it is cool inside but it your time is short this is one place to cut from your list.",

          "I'm not really into Cathedrals and they usually have to be huge and awe-inspiring to impress me. This Cathedral is neither but it was still worth popping in to see as its is quite a lovely place.",
          "There are many nooks and crannies and you have to take your time to really see everything that's offered here.",
          "We went to mass there on the sunday and it was beautiful especially the singing. It is a beautiful church but simple at the same time.",
          "Beautiful children's mass at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays. The music is splendid. The interior is romanesque.",
          "Notre-Dame Cahtedrale is definitely worth checking out! Overall, the entire city center of Avignon is very nice and I will definitely be back!",
          "The cathedral is large, but very dark! It was very peaceful when large tour groups didn't enter the building. It was a nice break out of the 1 rain shower we experienced too. I really liked the shiny statue on the top of the tower!",
          "Went to an organ recital here and spent a pleasant hour out of the sun enjoying some great music and interesting views of the building.",
          "Very lovely and chocked full of history. Beautiful tapestries, frescoes and interesting architecture from Medieval times.",
          "Well worth a visit as this church is Avignon's place of worship and is a lovely and cherished building. spend a few minutes contemplating here",
          "We went in because we'd been to the Pope's palace. It just an ordinary church. If you skip it you won't miss much.",
          "The cathedrale felt different, not like a normal church. But it had some wonderful pieces of art on the wall and quite a warm and welcoming feel about it. A small museum is testament to its past status and richness.",
          "WOnderful for the history, but lacking in any sense of spirituality or presence. Didn't really feel like a church to me",
          "Well worth a visit especially in conjunction with the climb up the Rochers for a view over Avignon. The Cathedral was welcoming and calm. A cool haven of serenity after walking the streets of the town looking at other sites. The wonderful frescoes remain vivid in the entrance.",
          "Lovely place to visit, very historical and beautiful.",
          "Very ornate in comparison to the Papal palace we had just been round. Peaceful and quite after the crowds in the square. Lovely views down to the square. Well worth a visit. I believe there are some grounds to explore but unfortunately we did not have time for that.",
          "Hi all, I would have expected more reviews for this place. I had a great visit to this place, the church has so much history. It makes the popes real to me. I sat on a seat in the church looking at the marvellous church and the beautiful windows. Then I looked to my left and",

        "wiki": "La Fondation Calvet is an art foundation in Avignon, France, named for Esprit Calvet, who left his collections and library to it in 1810.  The foundation maintains several museums and two libraries, with support from the town.  The original legacies of paintings, archaeological items, coins and medals, and medieval sculpture have been added to by many other legacies, and a significant deposit of works of art from the Louvre.  The archaeological collections and medieval sculpture are now housed separately in the \"Mus\u00e9e Lapidaire\" - once the chapel of the Jesuit College.  The main museum is in an 18th-century city mansion, to which modern buildings have been added; the Library bequeathed by Calvet, and the important collection of over 12,000 coins and medals, have moved to a different location in the city.\nThe foundation has changed its name on several occasions. It was initially called the \"Biblioth\u00e8que Calvet\", then the \"Museum Calvet\", then \"Mus\u00e9e Calvet\", and since 1985 the \"Fondation Calvet\". The foundation now manages seven museums, two libraries, and an important collection of coins and medals.In Avignon:\nBiblioth\u00e8que Calvet, the main library, housed since 1986 in part of what was once a cardinal's palace, the Livr\u00e9e Ceccano\nMus\u00e9e Calvet, the main art gallery, housed in an 18th-century city mansion (a h\u00f4tel particulier), the H\u00f4tel de Villeneuve-Martignan\nM\u00e9daillier Calvet, a collection of coins and medals\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, a collection of sculptures and archeological finds, housed in what was once the chapel of a Jesuit college\nMuseum et Biblioth\u00e8que Requien, a natural history museum\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais, a collection of medieval and renaissance paintingsIn Cavaillon, 25 km southeast of Avignon:\n\nMus\u00e9e Arch\u00e9ologique de l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu\nMus\u00e9es Jouve et Juif ComtadinLocal painters, including Pierre Parrocel and the Mignard family, are especially well represented, as is Hubert Robert.

          "Art lovers, dont miss it! The collection spans several centuries of European art. Set in an exquisite mansion.",
          "The most famous collection of art and sculpture in Avignon where we spent a full morning and later a full afternoon to fully appreciate what was there.Again,there is no entry charge although a donation is recommended.",
          "In a beautiful, old mansion. Many rooms filled with artwork - mainly from the 15th to 19th century. And one room with Egyptian items. Worth a look, and no entrance fee.",
          "It is free to enter this museum. Compared to the private ones, it is very large. There is plenty to see and well worth a visit.",
          "Some rooms in this gallery were closed and there were no facilities or a decent museum shop. Avignon is not charging for entry to some of its lesser collections. While the free access is very welcome, I do also wonder if it means that these institutions are being under resourced",
          "We arrived just after 10 AM Saturday morning when they were supposed to be open but were closed, so we went back in the afternoon. The well curated collection includes paintings, sculptures, and other objects from ancient Egypt and Rome all the way up to the early 20th century.",
          "Okay I was wandering and found it. The fact that it was FREE sealed the choice. I arrived after 14:00 when it reopened. There was an old man sleeping at the door. They had a few people sitting through out the museum. I was the only person here for about 15 minutes. It would get",
          "I spent hours in this fantastic museum each time I've visited this city. It's tucked on a beautiful historic street inside the walls.",
          "We found this place by accident and had a great time here. Gorgeous old building and paintings that we really appreciated. Worth a look if you have time!",
          "We\u2019ve been around Avignon for many years but somehow never got to this museum. Thank goodness we finally did - (bonus free entry!) there is a large assortment of European art from the 1600s to the 1800s and some more modern Worth the time, and make sure you take in the",
          "Once again, in the heart of Avignon just hidden from the main boulevard. Free admission and a nice 2 story collection to explore.",
          "Gorgeous building and some interesting exhibits. One of 4 or 5 free museums in Avignon now - thanks to tourist information for telling me.",
          "Probably because this museum is free we had no idea it was going to be so big - two vast floors - and how much time is needed to do it justice. There's a fair amount that we could skip but there were many excellent paintings, particularly French Impressionists. Well worth a",
          "This is a wee gem of a gallery with a good range of French and European art. The Bruegel is worth a mention, but local artists are a valuable addition.",
          "We stayed just down the street from this museum, a little gem in a beautiful city. We were lucky to be there at a time in July when the all museums were free. Located in a former mansion/palace, there were many fine examples of marble sculpture and modern art.",
          "Le Musee Calvert, was quite literally across the road from where we were staying so walking past was almost a daily occurrence and so to miss it impossible - and I'm glad we took time to go inside and learn about the history of the people and city of Avignon. From the marble",
          "This museum if filled with beautiful paintings...a must-see! It's within the city walls and very easy access when walking from your hotel.",
          "I\u2019m of the mindset that I\u2019m growing out (if not already there) of being part of a crush of tourists to enjoy fine art. Better are the smaller galleries, such as this one, where there is space to take in all the splendour. I was admiring some paintings when another couple came",
          "This museum has a decent collection of art from artists - painters and sculptors - from the Avignon and Rhone valley areas of France, with some Flemish artists. Most art is from the 16th - 18th centuries. Worth a stopover.",
          "Entry to this (and all of the city museums in Avignon) is free. The collection is housed in a beautiful 18th century Franco-Italian style mansion with courtyard and garden. The art ranges from Egyptian sarcophagi to 20th century paintings. There are sculptures including a bust",
          "This lovely little museum is does not charge admission. Great pieces and in one of our favorite rooms, the \"guard\" explained a great deal about the paintings and a fabulous trunk that featured about a dozen panels depicting the story of David. A wonderful piece. The museum",
          "This is a great museum, lots of interesting art and sculpture. It has a number of religious paintings from the medieval period as well as some more modern 19th and 20th century works. There is also an Egyptian room with various artefacts including a child mummy - gave me a bit",
          "Two floors containing a very good and solid art collection, with a specific focus on French artists. Also the Hotel Particulier, is beautiful. The entrance is free for this museum.",
          "This is housed in a beautiful old building. There is a large room of Egyptian items and a lot of very large classical paintings, but nothing later than early 19th century. Some attractive sculptures. We didn't use the audio guide.",
          "While the collection only features a few famous artists, and no famous works, I really enjoyed my visit to the Musee Calvet. While it isn't the Louvre, it houses a small collection of very fine paintings and is worth a visit",
          "We were offered a free audio device upon entry. It provided background on selected artwork that we would not have gathered without it. I particularly liked their Egyptian collection that you could get up close to without glass obstructing your view. Statues were nice too.",
          "A mixture of the pictures one hopes to see in a French art gallery, and the pictures one learns to hate in a French art gallery. Fortunately, there was enough of the good stuff to make us feel we'd got value for money.",
          "This is an amazing gallery full of impressive art from France and Italy. The Musee is deceptively large so you should allow for at least an hour and a half. Like most of the Art Galleries in Avignon there is nothing between you and the works so the staff keep a very close eye",
          "We had a great time here. There was sculptures and artwork in abundance with something to appeal to everyone's taste. As with most galleries and museums in France there is a lack of English signage which is a disappointment as I would have loved to know more. The Egyptian rooms",
          "If you have any interest in art, then ask for the audioguide. The commentary is in good English and explains many of the paintings and Egyptian items. I spent a pleasant and quiet afternoon wandering around. I agree with other reviewers that the stewards are lurking and watching",
          "This was our first stop in Avignon, just off the main commercial street that leads from the train station to the Palais des Papes. Long-standing museum with a great collection of European paintings, mainly 18th century French but lots of Italian and Dutch paintings too. Pay an",
          "Out for a walk and popped in for a quick look, our quick look took us over an hour and well worth it. The museum has some amazing art, sculptures and Egyptian artefacts.",
          "This museum has a nice garden to drink and eat, but the collection is really poor, i felt that i lost my time visiting the collection.",
          "This public museum has a great collection of paintings and sculptures. We really loved the room of impressionist paintings which has some wonderful pictures by artists familiar and unfamiliar. We visited the room twice. The rest of the gallery is also very interesting and there",
          "Musee Calvet featured in my guide book (Archibald Lyall's Companion Guide) mainly for its collection of modern art, donated by a well-known dealer. This little collection is excellent, but there is lots more to see. There are paintings by Joseph Vernet (after whom the street",
          "Strolled through the tiny streets this morning and came across the Mus\u00e9e Calvet. They open at 10 am so we walked up the street to a small caf\u00e9 and had a cup while we awaited the doors to open. Once we got into the rooms they were filled with some really exquisite art old and",
          "Not much choice since most museums were closed on Mon, but plesantly surprised particularly the painting of Pont d'Avignon from 1700's. Other paintings were of good quality. Not a wasted time.",
          "Be sure to get the Pass at the Tourist Office before you go. Present the Pass and have it stamped and pay full price admission. After that the fees are reduced. The Calvet is next to the Requien on Joseph Vernet. It has a beautiful courtyard. The exhibits include Egyptian",
          "The building is really nice and the collection is very good. Definitely worth a look and free for Avignonnais on Sunday!",
          "Not sure if it was just us who didn't get one - the receptionist was a little abrupt and had it not been for the security guard the only friendly faces were in the artwork. We weren't given any guide, information or direction so had to sort of \"wing it\". The Egyptian rooms",
          "This collection of art would have been 6 euros per person but luckily we had the Avignon Pass which made it half price. There was little to no information about the art and any that was there was only in French. We were also not informed that the top floor of the museum was",
          "There are several works by e.g Soutine here which are well worth seeing. There's a reduction for seniors. We didn't have long enough as though we were told we had till closure at 4.00 pm, staff were determined to the point of rudeness that we leave at 3.45.",
          "We arrived to see this much lauded museum a little too close to closing time. The person on reception however, was only too happy to take our money and told us that we had to be out by four. We started wandering around pretty quickly as there was much to see. At 3.50 guards came",
          "The collection was in two locations, sculptures in a church off Jean Juare and the rest of the collection in a restored town house. well worth visiting.",
          "A charming civic collection of 18th and 19th century art, housed within a stunning Hotel Particulier. The building itself is reason enough to visit, but within you will find fine collections of French paintings, as well as a large collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts. When",
          "I just got back from the museum. It is in a nice old house and costs Euro 6. They gave us a brochure in English because the museum is almost entirely in French. There are old paintings, sculptures, more recent art, and Egyptian art objects inside. We were the only ones in",
          "The Musee Calvet provides the opportunity to see many works not widely known by artists particularly from the 19th and 20th century. I had previously seen very few of these paintings and was struck by the breadth of the collection. Well worth a visit.",
          "There are a few interesting works in the collection, including several by Hubert Robert, but on the whole this is a museum you can skip if you're short of time. Some of the best works are copies of other works, by Brueghel, Van den Honthorst, Jeroen Bosch, and the like.",
          "Good place to visit on a Monday - it's open! - but you will have to listen to the loud conversation of the staff as you tour the museum. The lighting is rather weird - some paintings can't be clearly viewed due to the strength of the overhead lights, which is a pity, spoiling",
          "I was surprised and delighted by the breadth and depth of the collections here. Post impressionists including works by Cezanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, a number of impressionists, halls of medieval and renaissance paintings, classical statuary and more, all presented in a lovely",
          "I am a sucker for anything Egyptian, so it was quite cute that one of the employees immediately directed us to that section without our mentioning it. He then followed us around discreetly and would approach us to offer additional information about various items we were looking",
          "This museum exceeded our expectations. It was inexpensive with an Avignon \"pass\" and entry included an audio guide in English which was very informative. The 20th century art was stunning. The Egyptian rooms took our breath away and all this, housed in a beautiful mansion. Well",
          "Well worth a visit, some really good art work, there was a display of Ancient Egyptian artefact that we enjoyed very much. A beautiful building, very elegant and well looked after. Pleasant staff and plenty of them.",
          "What I saw of the museum was good but I visited close to noon knowing that the museum website stated that it closed at 1pm but having time to kill before a train trip to Orange. After paying the entrance price we were informed that the museum would actually be closing at 12:30",
          "We spent an hour here before we were removed for lunch. But it was probably enough time. If you like art and museums this is worth a visit. A very good collection considering one guy put it together. And the building has been reasonably well preserved as well although it not",
          "Some of the things you see here change depending on when you visit, other things are permanently located within the walls. There is printed materials to explain some of the things, others for purchase, I went on a day that a local school was visiting and learned a great deal",
          "Some excellent works - there is bound to be something to appeal to everyone. Painting from many eras, Egyptian pieces, sculptures and other objet d'art. A very pleasant place to spend an hour or two. The building itself is lovely.",
          "Definitely worth a look and better value we felt than Musee Angledon which was a smaller collection. Check out the fantastic Bruegels. Brilliant.",
          "The gallery is a converted palace. The 6 euro entry fee seemed expensive to me; the Pont D'Avignon was 5 euros so maybe that the is tourist sweet-spot for entry fees. We didn't have time to see the Egyptian collection which folks said was worth the price of admission alone.",
          "The museum is in a pretty XVIII palace that really makes the experience appealing. The entrance fee is 6 euros (only 3 euros if you have the museum pass that you get free if you visit one of the other museums in Avignon). Most of the work in the museum will be of only mild",
          "One of part uses a wheelchair but can walk up and down stairs and short distances. The staff at the museum were very careful to explain the limitations of the gallery, no elevator, and offered to bring the chair upstairs, empty, as long we could climb . Smiles at every turn.",
          "This museum is housed in a magnificent 18th century house which was unfortunately closed at the time that we visited. Even from the outside it looks to be an impressive place.",
          "We had a couple of hours to fill, so we decided to visit this museum. Well the time flew by and we were there for four hours. As with many museums, there is so much to take in",
          "A local gentleman recommended this museum on a rainy day, and we found it fairly interesting. Typical of much second tier historic European painters, but the Egyptian collection proved quite engaging.",
          "The impressive moment entering the cours d\u2019honour\u2019 of this grand building from Rue Joseph Vernet named after the painter (once a private home) is alone spectacular. Once inside we were pleased to discover the recent renovations has brought to life the enormous Egyptian",
          "There's some interesting collections here but it's organised in an unusual way. Unfortunately there are only French descriptions.",
          "A small museum worth seeing - use the Avignon Passion Pass. Senior discounts are offered. Can be seen in 1 - 2 hours.",
          "Visited in October 2015 partly because it was raining, and also because the museum is in an old (magnificent!) house. We weren't particularly interested in the paintings, but the Egyptian exhibits were great. The audioguide (included in the entrance fee) in English was good",
          "I really like the setting of this building and museum. It's a lovely residence that is quite charming. While there A beautiful paintings in this Collection, most of the paintings were pretty ordinary. Some of the ancient artifacts were quite intriguing, but I found most of the",
          "A large number of not very good well know painting reproductions and otherwise not much of interest. There are a few treasures from Egypt but not a lot else.",
          "Interesting information, paintings and historical stuff. Went out of there way to assist with the wheelchair.",
          "We spent sometime in the Calvet, admiring the ancient finds and art from various parts of Europe. It is probably best to visit in the quieter hours, as the museum is not huge, but it is open for long hours and most economical at just 2 euros",
          "You can jump into history of art inside this museum. You will find material from the egipcians to the modern and contemporary art. Lots of Renaiscence and italian art. I was very glad with the opportunity to go there.",
          "A fine collection housed in an interesting and attractive historic building, this museum afforded a peaceful and cool respite from the excessive July heat this summer. The staff was wonderful providing water to those of us dehydrated tourists and the museum collection was top",
          "This museum contains quite a lot and needs time to take it all in. It contains both paintings and sculptures and includes some quite modern exhibits. Some have been donated by various people i.e. Victor Martin and Marcel Puech.",
          "Well worth a visit if you like paintings. No concession to the English language but hey it's France. The receptionist not very friendly but wow to see some of the wonderful art it was worth getting past her.",
          "Lovely museum, very interesting building and varied collections. I particularly liked the paintings of Avignon and the Egyptian collection.",
          "This is a beautifully picked art collection. The museum was almost deserted when we were there and we spent the whole day there. Well worth a visit...",
          "Very friendly staff. Beautifully displayed and, importantly, in the summer heat, it has sofas spread throughout in the cool to rest!",
          "Lots of really good paintings, excellent Egyptian display. the Modern art is really good. Relaxed environment and plenty of space.",
          "A very good museum full of art, top notch artists and local ones too. Two floors of displays and well worth a visit.",
          "nice building, interesting vue of the 16-17th, not the first to take if only one day in Avignon. We've been there for several years so we know about all musea.",
          "This is a small museum with a pleasing collection. It was nearly deserted in late May when we visited and they unexpectedly closed for lunch. Great courtyard restaurant across the street so lunch was a bonus, and we returned to the museum in the afternoon. It is all classical",
          "We loved this museum. It is housed in a beautiful building and the exhibits are fascinating. It would really benefit from a cafe in the courtyard.",
          "This little museum is not untypical of the small museums which emerged from private collections in that it has no single central focus, but is rather eclectic, reflecting the collecting habits of the former owner. To the visitor that can either be part of the charm, or, simply",
          "The museum is well laid out with some individually superb pieces (and a good deal of less exciting stuff). Quiet, uncrowded, with some art that stopped me in my tracks. Definitely worth visiting for any art lover.",
          "We had planned to spend a day going to the less well known, non- Papel sites and tried this small museum. It was a splendid surprise. The building is just gorgeous, a very large private villa through wrought iron gates off a street. From the entry, quiet and very friendly, it",
          "This museum is housed in a beautiful building. Many treasures inside, even mummified cats. !! Lots of very lovely art, especially by Joseph Vernet.. my favourite being the one depicting a most reluctant donkey ... I knew just how he felt about the Mistral. !! Inexpensive,",
          "This museum had a mixture of paintings, sculptures, and Egyptian artifacts. The largest collection was of paintings of the 4th thru 18th century, including a few impressionists.",
          "we ran out of things to do and stumbled across this museum on a public holiday - amazing collection of european and Egyptian art and relics that you can see up close. We didn't get the audio guide but wished we did.",
          "After reading Michael Connelly books for years - I have seen one of the aboves painting in person (for those that read Michael Connelly you will know what books I am referring to.). For that alone it was worth the few euro due to 'second' visit on Avignon Passion - but some",
          "We honestly just stumbled on this place while we were wandering around. Entrance fee was cheap, so we went in. There's tons of great old artwork (of course). There was a whole exhibit on Dutch painters when we were there, which was fascinating. Also, there was a huge ancient",
          "The collection of Egyptology was notable for that - being an early 19th century collection largely augmented into its current form by 1850. Probably no great paintings, but some very interesting ones",
          "Very Nice, but nothing spectacular if you like museums and are in Avignon for a few days worth doing especially in inclemnt weather. A half day at most (less for many)",
          "There are some works by great artists here, no doubt. And also some remarkable works by local artist of the 19th century Joseph Vernet. Worth seeing if you are at all interested in art. If you have just a few hours in Avignon it is not a must, otherwise I feel you'd be wrong to",
          "again, a beautiful building houses this collection which was originally set up by Napoleon.Some of the rooms are ornately decorated . Interesting Egyptian collection Lovely tearoom in inner courtyard",
          "I stumbled upon this museum on a rainy day and was quite surprised by the quality and the variety of a Art. This former palace was a joy itself to step back in time and visualize what it must of been like. Each of the rooms has a period of Dutch, French and Italian artist from",
          "This collection of art and sculpture is not to be missed when visiting Avignon. Many works by Joseph Vernet (a painter from Avignon) who I was not that familiar with before coming here. Beautiful art. There is also a display of wrought-iron pieces that are amazing to see and",
          "Former private home. Went when groups of children and teens were there, not best to see art. Quite a collection of statues and mainly religious themed art. Lovely old building but they don't know how best to display art because of glare from windows and poorly placed lights.",
          "In the samm museum, different variety of arts were packed! I like it very much. I was impressed in Egyptian art on the first floor and a lot of paintings on the second floor.",
          "stunning collection of 18th and 19th century paintings and sculpture, beautifully laid out and pleasant attendants - simple garden but the palais was gorgeous",
          "There is much to enjoy in this unusual collection of painting egyptology and much more in the luminous setting of a courtyard house. The Breughels are particularly good.",
          "A museum full of interesting stonework. Unlike Narbonne when the light show is the main attraction here you can see detail as well as some archeological artefacts.",
          "It is an odd, eclectic collection of items. Obviously the Private collector had much more money than art sense, and purchased a wide range of items on a whim. The fun, I suppose, comes in the search. Some of the statues are outstanding for the time period. The Egyptian",
          "A great place to spend a couple of hours with a wonderfully eclectic mix of paintings and sculpture from a private collection housed in a beautiful mansion (check out the plasterwork on the ceilings). The museum itself is big but not overwhelming. The collections take in the",
          "We arrived just after 5 and they tried to persuade us not to go in as you \"need at least 45 minutes to see things properly\" and we would be asked to leave at 5.50 (closes at 6) - as we were only in Avignon for the day we persisted and said we would come in. The staff were",
          "On one of the hotest days of the year this was the coolest and emptiest place in town. A stunning collection that felt like a private view as there was so few people in the place.",
          "This museum was a welcome alternative from the medieval attractions of Avignon. Walk to and from Place de l'Horloge is charming.",
          "It rained on our last morning in Avignon so we needed somewhere dry to visit. The museum has an interesting range of sculptures and paintings (including some of Avignon) that kept us amused for an hour and a half. They also had some of the most comfortable chairs I have ever",
          "Very well-presented museum with good range of paintings and sculpture. Some interesting soutines and many excellent Vernets.",
          "We really did not know what to expect when we visited this museum but were captivated by the diversity of Art, from oils to sculpture to mummified cats. Many architectural relics, artifacts, rooms and rooms and rooms of art works and some oddities thrown in. A real treat and",
          "We visited Avignon on a Monday when many attractions are closed so decided on a visit to Musee Calvet as it was open. We loved it especially the Northern Masters room. The audioguide (included in the entrance fee) gave us new insights into the paintings and the history of the",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects.

Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

          "This was a pleasant museum, with some really interesting artwork throughout, which were great for a good photo opportunity! I had a lovely day visiting this gallery / museum and would recommend.",

          "I really enjoyed this museum, tucked in on one of the cobble streets of Avignon. If you like contemporary art and want a break from the busy, touristy locations in Avignon, step in and visit this collection. After you are done, you can have a refreshment in the beautiful",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each.

Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

          "We were simply looking for a \"market\" where we could buy a bottle of wine, a good loaf of bread, some cheese, etc. and a tour guide suggested Les Halles. We followed her directions to the square she described and did not see the small market she tolded us about. Then we saw",

          "We visited during lunch hour. People were eating at the seafood station. They open and serve the freshest mussels and clams to eat at their few tables, if you choose. We bought some truffle based tapenade and anchovy paste made locally. Both delicious. At a different vendor",
          "We enjoy traveling and seeing how locals live. Avignon has many places for tourists. This market will give you a glimpse into the everyday life of Avignon locals. Head out the back door and this will take you away tourist areas.",
          "Open: Daily, except Monday (6:00am to 1:30pm, weekend: till 2pm) Add: Pourtour du Carree d\u2019honneur \u2013 Allees de l\u2019Oulle, 84000 Avignon 1) A covered, indoor market with 40 stalls selling local produce, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, olive oil and other cookery",
          "A vibrant food hall with local fresh produce. The clientele seemed a mix of locals and visitors. A pleasant way to spend half an hour, stopping for a drink at one of the inside bars. We bought a few things to try back at our apartment but looks can deceive and our choices did",
          "I went with high expectations from reviews but was a little disappointed...nothing actually bad or wrong. Fruit and vege were fresh, but priced accordingly. There were several boulangeries, but no better or worse than the many in Avignon. Pleasant to wander round for half an",
          "Whilst staying in Avignon a visit to Les Halles was high on our \u2018to do\u2019 list. It did not disappoint. Produce of all types was available. The food on offer was very fresh and appealing. Well worth a visit.",
          "Everything about Avignon is magnificent - its exactly what you would expect from Provence and from a world class city within its borders - the magnificence of its architecture - its place in Frances history - its former glories an how they are still evident - its a do not miss",
          "As a foodie, I was in heaven and they had to close this place down before I left. So many places to explore and taste. Stop by and have some champagne and oysters, then pick up some local products and wine. I wish I lived near this, I would visit every day.",
          "It's an indoor market selling fresh produce. Nothing fancy for tourists to see. Few stalls sell pastries and breads, but there are plenty better options out there that offer better environment.",
          "Overrated. As a market, anywhere else in the city will be more authentic. As a food court, you'll find several nationalities as well as local specialties for take away, as well as seating areas.",
          "Spectacular spices, yummy cheeses, great tapanades, and all the variety of meat and fish you could want, all with no bad smells and all the good ones! Hard to not give this place a five, but there are few places to sit and few items to actually eat there. So unless you are",
          "We came on the city's main market hall at the edge of a square. The exterior was like a living thing; vines, grasses, and other plants were growing on the wall, creating a flat jungle look to the entrance. Inside there were tables and display cases everywhere and with beautiful",
          "We stumbled upon Avignon Les Halles by accident and were glad we did. This indoor market is fantastic. Full of excellent fresh produce which is all well priced. We bought a really tasty Chinese \u2018take-away\u2019 from here which was branded \u2018the best food of the holiday\u2019 by my company.",
          "WOW just so much great fresh produce available. What an amazing place to shop have a wine and chat to locals. I tried the Oysters as I do at every place I visit, they were excellent and very cheap. We went back to the market at least four times in our eight day stay in Avignon.",
          "There is nothing special about this place. The selection is same as most Halles in French cities. If you enjoy trying different food, then this would be a good place to go rather than to restaurants. The seafood and pastry are very good here.",
          "This was just what we were hoping for. Amazing array of French food at its best. Everything from goats and sheep cheeses to charcuterie and fresh meat. Fish that looked like it was only just caught, and probably was. Beautiful fresh vegetables And every sort of fruit and artisan",
          "Visited as part of an organized tour and we were given lots of sample. This pace is a feast for the eyes and the mouth! Lots of different stalls offering beautiful breads, pastries, cheeses, fruit and pommes de terre! Even purple potatoes.",

          "If you like looking at a great range of fantastic food, then this market is a place you must visit. Most importantly however, is the fact that the market also provides a good range of fine eating establishments. In U.K. market halls I am used to the on-site cafes being",
          "I've read on so many blog posts that this market is a must-see when visiting Avignon, but I have been to far better and more fairly priced farmers markets. Unless you're on a short vacation and/or have money to burn, I would not recommend going here. I am a (vegan) foodie, so",
          "Avignon has a \"closed\" air market for goodies in the morning til 2 It's not quite a farmers market but rather a daily boutique supermarket with specialty meats, wines, cheeses etc Also prepared foods for a picnic Good wines Deli type service Literally cutting duck heads off",
          "Loved visiting this food hall. It was jam packed with so much wonderful stuff - baked goods, produce, meats, prepared foods. It was also packed with lots of tourists on guided tours but plenty of locals around too.",

          "We enjoy visiting markets in France and as a permanent market Les Halles isn't as interesting as the local farmers markets. However it's got everything one might need. Try the ladies near the middle with the slices of Tomato Tartine, so good!",
          "Happened to wander into the central market and discovered it had unusually unique restaurants. For example in fish section we had a fish (dorade) fileted and bought some scallops. Then we took them to the nearby open bar who had them grilled/cooked for us and added french fries,",

          "We found this on our last day of the trip - what a find! Everything you can find French - enjoy!! I bought flavored salts for myself and as gifts. If you are able to cook (VRBO, Airbnb), the fish and seafood selection is out of this world",
          "Food. Food. Food. All types as fresh as it can possibly be! Vegetables, breads, meats, cheeses, seafood, etc. The list goes on and on. The hall where the vendors operate is very clean and attractive. Clean rest rooms. If you want to sample local foods, this is the place!!! You",

          "Unfortunately almost everything in France is expensive and quality over rated. Les Hales in Avignon typifies this. It is a lovely place to visit for the typical French ambience but remove the romanticism and the reality is somewhat different. We stayed at a private house in",
          "A small indoor food market but it has everything you could need with a huge variety of produce. The stalls are beautifully displayed as in all French food markets. Look out for whatever is in season in Provence when you visit, it was strawberries in May.",
          "Wandering through this fresh food market is a lovely experience for a visitor to Avignon and a wonderful introduction to French culinary delights. Fruits and vegetables, cheeses galore, meats, fish, sweets, fresh breads, spices, poultry, quiches, cakes and coffee. A real feast",
          "Everything is so well laid out and presented. The fresh meats and the cooked meats and cheese counters are spotless. The fruit and veg counters are very well presented. We bought some bread, cooked meats and cheese for our journey home, it was all very nice.",
          "We arrived as most of the stalls were closing but had a great assortment of seafood from a stall in the back corner. Only 4 small tables or so. The Utah Beach oysters were the best ever! The owner was very nice even though we were his last customers.",
          "Not much to look out from the outside building, but wait till you enter the door of Les Halles as an array of vibrant stalls await you. There is a good selection of delicious food items to be bought: cheeses, meats, olives, pizza, cakes , freshly caught fish, fruit, and spices",
          "We loved it here : great stall especially the sea food . Lovely tapas bar in the centre with what looked like the best moules frites . W e had wine and beer at the bar and felt like true locals . An absolute must !",

          "Whilst we were in Avignon, we came here on a Saturday morning to buy all of our picnic ingredients. FIRST IMPRESSIONS It's a building which has a vertical garden going up the front of it which is quite impressive to look at. Inside, there are LOADS of market stalls set up",
          "Found this whilst on bikes and cycling around Avignon . It is a must see, full of colour, smells and atmosphere. There are a few places to eat inside, including one where you can take your bought produce and they will cook it for you. If you want to purchase food of the region",
          "A must stop even if not a food lover. This market hums with activity and is filled with sights and smells that must be experienced. Anthony Bourdain would be proud of his restaurants namesake. Check the hours of operation. It is always open early.",
          "Small market with a couple of places to eat. Quite relaxed and well presented stalls. Do not expect too much. There are much better markets in France than this one.",
          "For those who saw Turkish or Spanish markets, I would say this is closed to a Spanish market. Filled with tasty treats, meats, vegs, perfect for a lunch on the spot for tourists.",
          "Les Hales in Avignon has range and choice on offer. The purveyors clearly take pride in presentation and quality - everything tastes as good as it looks. We bought our produce from Les Halles everyday for a week and were not dissappointed once with our selections which ranged",
          "So fun to stroll around and see all of the fresh veggies, fruit, meat, fish, wines, jams, honey, spices, sweets, etc, etc, etc. I always put together a little picnic lunch to take up to the garden above the popes palace or to the riverbank. Heavenly.",
          "One of the best markets around with all you could want for food and drink. This centrally located shopping destination has many choices and you will want to take your time and explore. We stopped at R\u00f4tisserie des Halles for a snack to go and the Farci chicken and regular",

          "I came to Avignon Les Halles as part of an optional tour onboard Viking's Best of France cruise. This particular tour showcased the foods of France - a taste of Provence and did it ever deliver. Beyond the green wall that artfully disguises a parking lot is an indoor market",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

          "It didn't match my expectations. I wanted to see more pictures of modern artists. But it was interesting what we saw.",
          "In the manner of William Burrell, the couturier collector has amassed an eclectic mixture of art including an outstanding (but for me disturbing in their imagery) collection of Picasso drawings. It is well worth the visit purely to see a superb Modigliani and a wonderful Sisley",
          "I spent a wonderfully peaceful afternoon here. A Cezanne, Van Gogh, Degas, Sisley and more all in this beautifully laid out house. Was lucky enough to be there to see the Picasso exhibition as well, truly one of my favourite parts of my few days in Avignon",
          "My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Avignon and this afternoon we visited the Musee Angladon which is immediately behind the impressive Library Building. Entrance fee of Euros 6.50 each (reduced over 65 rate) was reasonable and - although we were expecting to visit a",
          "A small but potent museum with a good selection of paintings. All paintings have English descriptions and easy to follow. This is about 1 hour-1 hour 30 min activity.",
          "A cosy beautiful museum with the surprise of having a Van Gogh, Cezanne, Degas, Mogidliani and lots of Picasso\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t very busy when we visited (Saturday afternoon) so it was a leisure stroll through the rooms, would go back again",
          "The paintings in this museum are worth a special visit. Mogdigliani, Picasso, much more. I was overcome with feeling with the beauty of the paintings.",
          "This is not a large museum but it is still worth visiting. Amoungst the paintings on display you will find Modigliani and van Gogh.",
          "The quality of the art on show here is to be recommended although it is not an extensive gallery. If time is short visit it in preference to the Musee Calvet.",
          "A small but well curated collection of well known and not so well known artists, including Picasso, Degas, and Van Gogh.",
          "Worth a visit for the Van Gogh (the only one of his paintings still in Provence), Modigliani, Sisley and others. However, you can't help but regret that many other highlights of Jacques Doucet's collection (such as Van Gogh's Irises and Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon) were sold",
          "I saw a few pieces that left an impression and the art is in a beautiful old house. A little tricky to find using our map, but locals showed us the way there. There's a tiny gift shop and many nearby cafes for a coffee before/after.",
          "This museum is an act of love. Lovely exhibits and fun to walk up the grandstaircases. A love way to spend time in Avignon!",
          "This was a lovely museum and odd collection of superior paintings. It was nice to get off the street and into the quiet space this museum offered, but I think it could have done a little more with explanations for visitors who are a little fine art challenged.",
          "A very impressive ground floor paintings. Really was a great place to spend some time. Worth the small price too!",
          "Not a very large collection, but there's lots of excellent stuff in the permanent collection, particularly the Flemish and Impressionist paintings. The van Gogh was on loan to the gallery in Arles but they had loaned them a lovely Hockney van Gogh tribute in exchange. The",
          "This new and short time exhibition is worth a substantial visit as one needs to read the documents and appreciate the wonderful choice made in conjunctin with the widow of Fran\u00e7ois Morellet. One can spend a little more time to take a great pleasure with a wonderful Modigliani,",
          "Maybe I am jaded, as I have seen lots of museums and lots of art all over the world. This is a very small exhibit, featuring a collection of the late Jacques Doucet. There are a few very good paintings, the ones by Van Gogh have been loaned out. The mansion itself is nice,",
          "This private collection is very well displayed in a historic building. The remnants of a collection by Jacques Doucet, a wealthy fashion couturier and aart collector, the works are very well-displayed and paintings by Degas, Sisley, Picasso and Hockney hang comfortably together.",
          "The Modigliani is great, but they really over-sell the collection. There is one small room of post-impressionists and the rest of the collection is not compelling. They had an interesting temporary exhibit, so if you feel like you need to go, check to see what they have on offer.",
          "Interesting and eclectic collection of art objects. The history of the collector is interesting as he was a great patron of the arts in Avignon.",
          "This is a small diverse collection of an art collector displayed in a city mansion. He had a little bit of many types of art. Some of the rooms also had period furniture.",
          "Well, the guide books said it was open, the official Avignon leaflet said it was open. It was closed. No stars because we couldn\u2019t enter. No explanation on the door either. Avoid in January whatever the info says.",
          "This is a small but interesting museum, containing paintings by such artists as Van Gogh, Cezanne, Degas, Manet, Sisley and Picasso. If, as we do, you love Impressionist art, it is well worth a visit",
          "Not the most interesting museum on our trip, but it had a few pieces of interest tied into the Pope's palace and worth a visit.",
          "Our hotel owner recommended this museum which doesn't open until 13.00 hours so we stayed on to visit it. It is a private museum and has a small collection of paintings. The original collection was put together by a fashion designer and some of his work is on show. The upstairs",
          "The Angladon is a smaller museum, with a varied collection of paintings, sculpture and furniture compiled by Jacques Doucet, a fashion designer and patron of the arts from the turn of the 20th century displayed in an 18th-century mansion. Well worth the visit and wonderfully",
          "The heart of the collection was put together by Jacques Doucet, a major couturier who was also a patron of the arts and a friend of many artists. He had a fantastic eye. Highlights include a wonderful little group of Picassos, an important Cezanne still life and the only Van",
          "an interesting and beautiful house containing a small but quality collection of art. I am a sucker for a vincent and was intersting to see a train picture but there are other artists here as well and well worth an hour of your time to stroll round",
          "Beautiful \"demeure\", with a splendid collection of 1st rate paintings, from Chardin to C\u00e9zanne, from Degas, Sisley and Van Gogh to Picasso and Modigliani",
          "This is just how I like my art galleries: small and intimate with an eclectic collection of art in beautiful surroundings and a good smattering of Impressionists. The Van Gough that featured trains rather than landscape was particularly fascinating. Go.",
          "We were recommended this Museum by a friend who had visited previously. Not massive but a very interesting range of exhibits set in a lovely house.",
          "Well worth an hour or so to look at an extraordinary collection in a beautiful house in a secluded corner of Avignon. If you've been somewhere else first, use the Avignon Passion voucher to get a discount. The collector, a fashion designer, was evidently a man of civilised",
          "This is a delightful gallery, which, although small, has very interesting paintings. We were particularly impressed by the range of paintings by Dufy",
          "Made a point to come to this museum as I enjoy impressionism. Was surprised to find that it only opens after 1pm so had to wait to enter the collections. The building that the collection is housed in is wonderful and several of the rooms feature as exhibits as their own. It was",
          "I'll be honest - I was not that interested in going to the Mus\u00e9e Angladon, but a friend really wanted to see it. I was really glad we went though. The collection is not huge, but it's in an old restored (huge) house which is interesting in and of itself. The exhibit we saw was",
          "I happened upon this delightful art gallery while doing a walking tour of Avignon. There were a number of impressive pieces, including some by Dutch Masters, Impressionists and contemporary French artists. The origimal owmers of the gallery were artists themselves and there are",
          "We really enjoyed this small museum. It is well curated and not overwhelming. The exhibit includes furnishings as well as artwork.",
          "This is a small but very interesting collection. We especially enjoyed the modernist art - things I had not seen before by Cezanne and Picasso and others. There was a special exhibition of Raoul Dufy paintings. It was interesting to see so many Dufy's in once place. I was",
          "Worth an our if you are an art lover. Based in what was a house and still contains some furniture and wall decorations though not set up like a British stately home. Smallish collection over three floors. Lift available. Couple of paintings by people like Sisley, Vincent and",
          "We enjoyed the the Musee Angladon. By far the best of several places we visited in Avignon. It has a solid collection, nothing amazing but all good.",
          "If you are an art lover & find yourself in Avignon don't miss out on visiting this charming little museum tucked away in a back street close to Tourist Information. Raoul Dufy exhibition was featuring when we visited but there are Picasso's, Degas, Cezanne's Van Gogh's amongst",
          "The museum is housed in the lovely home of a collector who recognized the talents of late 19th and early 20th century pioneers. It's a small museum, but houses works from a number of influential artists.",
          "Some really nice works in this collection. Also lovely carpets. Well worth the visit. Be sure to get your Avignon map/brochure stamped to benefit from discount at museums.",
          "Staff very helpful, collection not as big as seemingly inferred from advertising material, worth a visit if you have time",
          "Locals did not know where this gallery was. As the man at the entrance desk said \"we are neither the biggest nor the most famous\". It's size is the Angladon's strength. Given only one Cezanne still life there is no temptation to rush to the next - there is no next. Likewise",
          "We spent an hour of a rainy afternoon here. The museum is not large and has it share of grand masters and lesser known works. We loved the fact it still had some of the owners original furniture in the house and there were reference books on the art pieces scattered throughout",
          "This museum is small enough to go round and see everything in detail without exhaustion. There are very interesting 19th-20th century works, and they have some good education programmes.",
          "To begin with the positives; this museum holds some beautiful artworks? As advertised, it has examples of the work of some wonderful artists and I would love to give it a higher rating, but it was expensive to go in, ( unsmiling reception at the desk- it does make a difference)",
          "We loved this museum, some great treasures including Degas and Van Gogh. One of our favorite things was that they had a clipboard, paper and colored pencils so the kids could draw while they toured the museum. It made it a great experience for our son and especially for us, too.",
          "We are glad we went but frankly disappointed at the extent of the paintings. Having found the Musee, go around to the other side of the building and there is an information centre for wine, where we got some useful brochures on Rhone wines.",
          "Do not expect too many objects exposed. Several Degas, Van Gogh,Picasso,Modigliani, Sisley and Sezanne are on the exposition",
          "This museum contains interesting modern art. It is very centrally located and despite its small size houses some gems.",
          "A small museum but well worth a visit. Pick up the Avignon Passion Pass free from the tourist office. Once you have paid the full price to visit one attraction you get reduced rates at others. Chose the museum you pay full price for carefully to maximise the savings you can",
          "If you have an hour to spare one afternoon (possibly less), this is a nice option for art lovers. The first floor features the likes of Modigliani, Picasso and Van Gogh. Upstairs there is a room or two of medieval works, which seemed oddly disjointed, and the rest was mostly",
          "This is a personal collection so it's diverse, interesting and sometimes a little quirky. The great thing? It's small. You don't have to commit a day and several kilometres of walking. This is museum that isn't crowded; there's no queue outside and security is discreet.",
          "This was an interesting museum with one Van Gogh and a few doodles of Picasso. Lots of other beautiful art work and we were glad we visited this place",
          "Smack in the middle of medieval Avignon is this small museum of 20th Century art. The museum is situated in a mansion on one of Avignon's small side streets and it is a delight. Again, like other tourist sites, your perception of this place may be formed by your art",
          "Museum was just round the corner from my hotel, so it was easy to pop in for a quick visit, only open from 1pm. Some remarkable painiting in the collection, just a pity that all the information is in French, my reading French not enough to get a complete grasp on the",
          "A real must-visit! You will find great pieces of art where you expect them the least: in a small, hidden museum in one of the cute labyrinth-like streets of the old town of Avignon. The first floor is reviving the ambience of an old mansion. It is so wonderfully decorated that",
          "Interesting collection of private items, from pictures to furniture. You will find paintings from Degas, Van Gough, and other masters of the 19th and 20th century.",
          "If you spend time in Avignon be sure not to miss this little gem. Housed in an elegant old mansion, this collection is varied. It includes works by Van Gogh and Modigliani and many others. We spent a relaxed and calming hour here.",
          "Free coffee in foyer, a good meeting place. A quaint place to visit- not too large and a beautiful small collection of carefully chosen works by master painters; some Sisley, Modigliani, beautiful older portraits - a few precious pieces of rare Chinese porcelain and pottery;",
          "Museum open from 13:00- 18:00. When you enter, the receptionist says that the museum needs about 45 minutes to see. Full price is 8 Euros/ reduced 6.50 Euros. ( The reduced price can be obtained when you visit any other museum in Avignon. After your first museum, all others get",
          "Visited towards the end of the afternoon and this small haven which is very much quality over quantity. I went to see the Modigliani (which is used on all their publicity material) and the small Picassos, but they also have work by a number of 19C masters - nice to see what I",
          "A few memorable paintings, but not much to see for the price of admission. The house lacks the warmth that you might expect to find in the setting for a such a personal collection.",
          "This museum is closed in the mornings and opens in the afternoon at 13.00. and is housed in a city mansion. We enjoyed seeing the paintings by Van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne, Manet and others We particularly liked Sisley's snow scene and the Modigliani portrait. There are also period",
          "We were recommended this museum from someone we met. We hadn't even heard about it before. It is quite small museum but with some fantastic art (Picasso, Degas, Manet, Van Gogh and many others) as well one floor with furniture from the man who once lived there. Go see!",
          "Just ok, interesting stuff, but not worth the \u20ac6...there were some nice works, but the lighting was poor and there were no English translations. I don't understand locking out potential tourists who want their major language represented.",
          "This is a very small private museum that I didn't think was worth the price. Yes, there are a few well known artists represented, but it pales in comparison to other museums that have larger collections. I didn't think it was really worth the price of admission.",
          "We liked the house but \u0175e were dissappointed by the art. Yes there is a Van Gogh, Sisley, Degas, Picasso and Co but it wasn't really that exciting. We are probably spoiled and used to bigger collections, still if you don't mind paying a small fee to see a few paintings in an",
          "Go to see the beautifully decorated rooms rather than the art work. It is a restored house with a few very special paintings.",
          "A private museum in the centre of Avignon displays masterpieces in the home of the museum founders. Degas, Cezanne, Sisley and one of the only paintings by Van Gogh exhibited in Provence. Also drawings and 18th Century furniture and object that formed the art lovers' interior.",
          "Wonderful pictures that you have not seen before. The building is also a tour in itself. Easy to find and great to tour.",
          "You must visit this museum. There are some fascinating parts to the collection. The art of Picasso Cezanne, Van Gough are a must to see. There are also exhibits included in set pieces for rooms as they were furnished and decorated years ago.",
          "I just loved this entrancing and beatifully arranged museum/art gallery in a quiet part of Avignon. It was a refreshing change from the magnificent Roman ruins that littered a cruise down the Rhone. It provided a quiet and peaceful retreat away from the crowds in the centre.",
          "With a special fondness for small, intimate museums, and having visited the Angladon Museum's website, we were eager to tour the Angladon. Unfortunately, our expectations were dashed. Unlike other one-artist or one-family museums, like the Sorollo in Madrid or the Maillol in",
          "The collection if OK, not great though. Tough to find. For me the most interesting thing was the old house that the owner / collector lived in. Still set in the style of the era - I found the building a better attraction than the collection.",
          "A very beautiful and interesting house with an equally beautiful art collection creatively and aesthetically displayed.",
          "This small museum which is styled to reflect a lived in mansion contains amazing treasures. Paintings by Van Gogh,Picasso, Degas, Manet and many more artists are displayed here, I have never seen so many well known artists contained in a small space. There are artifacts from",
          "Such an interesting collection...the Sisley was the highlight of the collection for me! I spent quite a long time studying it...the house was close to the office du tourisme and was not over busy ..so it was lovely to be able to study paintings in peace!",
          "Another good museum to visit in Avignon. Some exhibits by some very well known painters. Well worth an hours visit. Remember your visitors pass.",
          "An absolute great find and well worth a second vist lots of wonderful paintings and ceramics entrance fee very reasonable",
          "I particularly liked the large photographs of how the rooms were furnished in the past. The art deco details were so luxurious. I would be difficult not to admire these collectors. The photos showed the most wonderful pictures they possessed. The style and colours were",
          "It is housed in the former residence of the Angladon family who left it to the benefit of the general public. It was the private collection of the Parisien fashion designer Doucet, who in turn left it to the Angladons. Some great examples of the work of Cezanne, Van Gogh and",
          "Although I've been to Avignon several times, I'd overlooked this museum until now. A small collection of modern art (i.e. impressionist and beyond). Great artists represented such as Van Gogh and Modigliani. Interesting background of Parisian fashion designer's collection",
          "I would recommend this only to see inside an interesting Avignon house and less for the art which is limited. There are some nice rooms with the original furnishings, wallpaper etc which are interesting.",
          "Very interesting ....only takes about an hour to see all the paintings and wonderful antique furniture. My personal favourite was viewing the Van Gogh and Sisley paintings. They do concessions for seniors. Just ask.",
          "This is a small gallery with a few exhibition rooms, stemming from a private collection from the late 19c and early 20c. I liked the informality of the place, the 'honesty box' for your Nespresso coffee capsule, kids colouring books to find the next Van Gogh, and the",
          "The Musee Angladon is well worth a visit and is bang opposite the Livre Ceccano mansion. The collection was put together by two C20th painters (man & wife) who were no mean artists in their own right as you'll see. Once inside you must leave any size bags in mini lockers by the",
          "Small museum housed in a former private home. Several important paintings by well known artists. This museum houses the only Van Gogh painting in all of Provence.",
          "This is a personal collection of art, and as such it doesn't necessarily hang together as a curated collection might, but it is all the more charming for that. If you're interested you can learn a lot from the items on display about Jacque Doucet, the collector - he had an",
          "The musee Angladon is a gallery in relatively central Avignon, the collection contains a Modigliani and a Van Gogh, the museum was a surprise find and a very pleasant one at that. The superlatives are endless.",
          "This small museum is very personal - one family's vision of modern art so an eclectic but formidable range of art - a Van Gogh, a Modigliani, a Sisley and several other surprises! Do go and enjoy its peaceful ambiance!",
          "This is a small museum with an eclectic collection but worth visiting if you have the time because of the impressionist art. A couple of gems by Picasso, worth the trip for those alone, and one brilliant painting by Cezanne.",
          "A converted mansion, this museum is small yet full of wonderful art, most from th egreat masters. It has th eonly original Van Gogh in Provence. Really enjoyed the visit.",
          "Musee Angladon in Avignon houses a family art collection. It has some great pieces (Van Gogh's Paris-Mediterranean train, Modigliani's A Woman with a Red Blouse, C\u00e9zanne's Still Life, Vuillard's Boy Glimpsing at Door). Unfortunately most of great art works have been sold from",
          "it was a personL family collection and that made it interesting and very eclectic. There are old Masters as well as impressionist painting in what was a private home. Good place to visit for,art lovers.",
          "Wonderful smallish museum in Avignon. An old house turned museum has a very quiet charm. Several nice impressionist paintings. About one hour and you have seen it all but such a good break from the touristy streets. They close during the middle of the day so check the",
          "My last review was suppose to this place. Can u change my \"very interesting musuem\" to this place and delete the last one please?",
          "Very personal art collection of early 20th century modern artists. When in Avignon, do go here. It was his private home before becoming a museum with his collection plus his 2 hires who did art themselves. Theirs is exhibited in a room, yet the Picasso's, etc are worth visiting",
          "This was a private house and a private art collection, but what a strange mix. There are stunning modern pieces - go there just to see the Modigliani - but also older and, to me, less interesting subjects. Definitely worth seeing if you like looking at art. Not many places to",
          "A good collection of art and interesting history of the the previous owners of the property and their own artwork.",
          "This little museum had two Degas, a Van Gogh, a Cezanne, a Sisley and many more masters, yet there were very few people. I have never been able to get that close and spend so much time with historic painters.",
          "A wide assortment of items ranging from art, to furniture and historical significance. An hour should do it. Audio tours are not available but there are sheets in each room describing what is in the room, etc. Worth an hour visit.",
          "This has to be a must see in Avignon. This reasonably small collection is housed in the home of the collectors and accessible over two floors of the house. The building really is nothing special though a good exhibition space but the actual collection of Jacques Doucet",
          "This museum is small but excellent. The remaining portion of the fabulous art collection of Jacques Doucet, a contemporary of Charles Frederick Worth in the fashion world. His widow sold Piacasso's 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon' to MOMA in 1937. His nephew inherited the collection",
          "This is worth a look. There are works by a number of famous artists, admittedly no well known pieces, but quite a diverse range. These are all in a beautiful home, interspersed with a collection of lovely furniture, sculptures and other artifacts. Can recommend. (Like many",
          "Loved the house with beautiful Chinese ceramics collection and various interesting objects but the treasures are the Van Gogh, the Cezanne and the Picassos. Really lovely little museum.",
          "Mus\u00e9e Angladon - Private collection of fine Impressionist and Asian Art. Very quiet spot to enjoy art - just off the main drag in Avignon. If you like Impressionism like I do, you\u2019ll want to spend a few hours walking through the museum to see works by: Degas, Modigliani,",
          "We wanted to do something else bar the Pope's palace, we choose this and it was OK. Nothing special but has some good pieces and a fair selection of art. E4.50 with a discount for visiting the palace beforehand, so not expensive.",
          "It was interesting to see the lifestyle of a prosperous dressmaker who amassed a quality collection of both French and Asian art. Well worth the price of admission.",
          "Rarely do you get to see so many well known artists' works in one small place. Brilliant information panels available in several languages. It tok us just over an hour and we felt really enriched by the experience.",
          "A small but lovely collection in a private home, turned art museum. As well as the art work, the upper floor has 18th century living rooms to walk through. Very enjoyable.",
          "Musuems in Avignn are all relatvely small, and this one more \"cozy\" so to speak an a tad electic certainly vis a vis the Palais",
          "The 19th century works on the lower level include the only Van Gogh in Provence, which makes the place definitely worth a visit.",
          "of all the museums in Avignon this was my favourite, a real mix of items on display in a private house.a real eclectic selection of art also contains works by local artists which were interesting",
          "Opens at 1PM Worth a visit. Lovely home and art by masters and the owners. A look at their lives and how they lived.",
          "A tour of a home and the lives of the artists/art collectors who lived there. Be sure to read the cards and sit to appreciate the rooms and the art. Just Grand. Opens at 1 PM",
          "This was a surprise. It was once privately owned and the owners' collection of paintings and objects d'art are on display. It was beautiful and had a voyeuristic tint to it as one is looking into a once private world. The wallpaper alone is worth the visit.",
          "Sometimes wealthy people just have money but this family befriended artists, like Cezanne who painted a pitcher in a room of the house right then & there. Imagine that! Besides the folks like Picasso (those ladies of Avignon? that was here) and such, there are also Asian",
          "A couple who lived in the house collected many fine paintings and collectibles and have no children so they donated their house and its collection to Avignon for a museum. Many of the works had no labels so it was hard to know information about the object of art. Some of the",
          "We were so glad that we took the time out of our short schedule in Avignon (river cruise) to visit this art gallery. A serene, jewel box of a gallery, with some serious artists represented!",
          "Loved this museum. They has a special show of Toulouse Lutrec paintings along with a great Modigliani. Tucked away on a side street, it isn't big but well worth the time and the discounted admit with the museum pass",
          "Perhaps because much space was taken up with a loan exhibit of Toulouse-Lautrec's theatrical posters and lithos, there was less room for the permanent collection. What was left on third floor was an uninteresting hodge-lodge of furnishings from the late owners, but one excellent",
          "Great collection of paintings: Picasso, Van Gogh, Manet, Sisley. Not too busy and the staff were friendly",
          "This small museum used to be a private house, owned by the artist descendants of the original collector. It is delightful, and still has the feel of being a home, with some impressive works on display. They also put on special exhibitions, so it's worth checking this out too.",
          "One enthusiast's art collection - few paintings but some jewels including a Matisse, a couple of Picassos, some gorgeous Degas... Wheelchair access only to one of the two floors - the more interesting one I think - and we were only charged half price because of this.",
          "This is a small tucked-away museum in the old town of Avignon. It's very near when I stay so I decided to check it out. I was impressed by the broadth and depth of Jacques' collections, which include Van Gogh, Piccasso, Magliano, Eileen Gray, royal furnitures and paintings,",
          "Tucked away off the main streets is this charming small museum - an eclectic mix of paintings reflecting the taste (and inheritance) of its founder. A handful of real gems, including Modigliani'si Women in a Pink Blouse, Van Gogh's Railway wagons, two Foujita paintings and a",
          "The museum gallery is such a special opportunity to share in what was Jacqques Doucet's personal lifetime collection of paintings, books and other treasures. They are all housed in the home of his heirs and this special presentation is a must for anyone wanting a glimpse into",

See also the List of Ancien R\u00e9gime dioceses of France and the List of French dioceses in the 19th and 20th century for information prior to 2002.\n\nPope John Paul II completely redrew the map of French ecclesiastical provinces in December 2002, in order to coincide more closely with the map of French administrative regions, but losing in several instances remaining boundaries surviving from late Roman times. This meant the creation of a few new Metropolitan archbishoprics and ecclesiastical provinces. This also entailed, for several archbishoprics, the loss of their metropolitan status (symbolised by the wearing of the pallium): their bishops nevertheless retained the title of archbishop.\nAs a result of history, many former episcopal sees were united, mainly as a consequence of the French Revolution; hence many dioceses bear the names of several cities, in which case, only the first one is the cathedral see where the bishop still actually resides.\nIn France, most dioceses coincide with a department (administrative province), but there are a few exceptions, where some arrondissements are attached to a diocese outside the department, or form a separate diocese within the department (this happens mainly in departments with numerous populations, such as Nord or Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne). Along with the list of the new ecclesiastical provinces and their suffragan dioceses, this list also gives the equivalent of the diocesan jurisdiction in departmental terms.\n\n\n== Current European

          "We have frequently visited this beautiful Gothic Basilica in the heart of Avignon, located not far from the Palais des Papes, It is a great place to spend some quiet moments of reflection and prayer while visiting the city and is filled with beautiful art.",
          "A nice little gothic church with some decent artwork inside, religious decorations. A nice to see of you happen to pass by...but definitely not a must",
          "Avignon is known for its many churches. One of the smallest but most charming churches in Avignon is St. Peter's Church, built in stunning Gothic style. The church was founded in the middle of the 14th century on the remains of an earlier church from the 7th century. Before",
          "in one of the oldest churches of the city, you will be touched by the abundance of old paintings. Also relics of Pierre de Luxembourg.",
          "Tucked away in a quiet side street with an impressive frontage and doors is this church. Its tower is visible in various parts of the city but walking you could easily pass without entering. And internally it is special. Lovely stained glass windows, huge old paintings,",
          "Disclaimer: I have a weakness for medieval Gothic churches. That said, Eglise Saint-Pierre is a winner. The bland exterior walls give no clue to the vast space, classic architecture, grand altar, beautiful chapels and stained glass. The interior, in its way, is a work of art;",
          "There are no shortage of Churches (and a Cathedral - see separate Review) to visit in Avignon but - save yourself a lot of time and effort - and go to the Eglise Saint Pierre (conveniently located immediately behind the Cathedral/Palais des Papes) first!! It is impressive both",
          "This church is located more or less midway between the Place d'Horlogue and Les Halles so very close to the town center. It's not an enormous church but the interior is quite special. The organ is in the process of restoration so please do give a donation. The alter is amazing",

          "This is worth seeing as part of the history walk in Avignon. I would not make it a destination place. At night it has a nice scene with the lights and in the day it has the antiquities of an old church.",

          "The highlight for me was the old, unrestored alter to St Pierre with his clothing and relics. He died in 1300s of the plague. Nice church hidden in some quiet streets behind the palace. The cafe out front seem to be favorite with the locals.",

          "We went to Avignon for shopping, the Pope's Palace, and the bridge. This was a free, easy in and easy out church. As far as French churches go, this was just nice. Nothing spectacular, but not disappointing either. Worth a quick stop if you walking around Avignon. We",

          "Unfortunately, it was raining when we visited this church so it was rather cluttered by tourists sheltering form the weather. The fa\u00e7ade around the west door has some very exciting carvings and is well worth looking at, even if you don't go inside. The church contains a few",

          "From the beautiful carved wood doors to the paintings, statuary and detailed altars, Eglise Saint Pierre is worthy of a visit when you're in Avignon. The spirituality and peacefulness is palpable as you sit quietly and contemplate the interior of this wonderful church.",
          "We found this church as we wandered around Avignon. This is a gorgeous, quiet spot. Note the beautiful exterior. Worth a visit.",
          "The gothic style is there , but above all not many churches I have visited around Europe bear the Holy Spirit on a prevailing position as this one. Being a non-observant religious subject I apologize for the faithfull ones and ask humbly if there is an explanation that i missed",

          "From the outside it doesn't look grand, but if one looks at the details of the door and above, one can see this was a thoughtful structure. Certainly worth time exploring. Another suggestion: the only bistro in the same square, L'Epicerie, has the very nice ambience for dinner",
          "The thing people need to know is that, even if located inside Avignon, it is not in France! When you enter the church, you are in Vatican City! Anyways, the church is magnificent from the outside and the inside ;)",

        "wiki": "Lyon or Lyons (UK: , US: , French: [lj\u0254\u0303] (listen); Arpitan: Liyon, pronounced [\u028ej\u0254\u0303]; Italian: Lione, pronounced [li\u02c8one]) is the third-largest city and second-largest urban area of France. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne, about 470 km (292 mi) south of Paris, 320 km (199 mi) north of Marseille and 56 km (35 mi) northeast of Saint-\u00c9tienne. Inhabitants of the city are called Lyonnais.\nLyon had a population of 513,275 in 2015. It is the capital of the Metropolis of Lyon and the region of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The Lyon metropolitan area had a population of 2,265,375 in 2014. The city is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, and historical and architectural landmarks; part of it is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema: it is where Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cinematograph. It is also known for its light festival, the F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.\nEconomically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, as well as for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games, and in recent years has fostered a growing local start-up sector. Lyon hosts the international headquarters of Interpol, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Euronews. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Lyon is considered a Beta city, as of 2018. It ranked second in France and 40th globally in Mercer's 2019 liveability rankings.\n\n\n== History of Lyon ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Lyon ===\n\nAccording to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BC, the Roman Senate ordered the creation of a settlement for Roman refugees of war with the Allobroges. These refugees had been expelled from Vienne and were now encamped at the confluence of the Sa\u00f4ne and Rh\u00f4ne rivers. The foundation was built on Fourvi\u00e8re hill and officially called Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum). The earliest translation of this Gaulish place-name as \"Desired Mountain\" is offered by the 9th-century Endlicher Glossary. In contrast, some modern scholars have proposed a Gaulish hill-fort named Lug[o]dunon, after the Celtic god Lugus ('Light', cognate with Old Irish Lugh, Modern Irish L\u00fa), and d\u00fanon (hill-fort).\n\nThe Romans recognised that Lugdunum's strategic location at the convergence of two navigable rivers made it a natural communications hub. The city became the starting point of main Roman roads in the area, and it quickly became the capital of the province, Gallia Lugdunensis. Two Emperors were born in this city: Claudius, whose speech is preserved in the Lyon Tablet in which he justifies the nomination of Gallic Senators, and Caracalla.\nEarly Christians in Lyon were martyred for their beliefs under the reigns of various Roman emperors, most notably Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus. Local saints from this period include Blandina, Pothinus, and Epipodius, among others. The Greek Irenaeus was the second bishop of Lyon during the latter part of the second century. To this day, the archbishop of Lyon is still referred to as \"Primat des Gaules\".Burgundians fleeing the destruction of Worms by the Huns in 437 were re-settled at Lugdunum. In 443 the Romans established the Kingdom of the Burgundians, and Lugdunum became its capital in 461. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, Lyon went to the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I. It later was made part of the Kingdom of Arles. Lyon did not come under French control until the 14th century.\n\n\n=== Modern Lyon ===\nFernand Braudel remarked, \"Historians of Lyon are not sufficiently aware of the bi-polarity between Paris and Lyon, which is a constant structure in French development...from the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution\". In the late 15th century, the fairs introduced by Italian merchants made Lyon the economic counting house of France. Even the Bourse (treasury), built in 1749, resembled a public bazaar where accounts were settled in the open air. When international banking moved to Genoa, then Amsterdam, Lyon remained the banking centre of France.\nDuring the Renaissance, the city's development was driven by the silk trade, which strengthened its ties to Italy. Italian influence on Lyon's architecture is still visible among historic buildings. In the late 1400s and 1500s Lyon was also a key centre of literary activity and book publishing, both of French writers (such as Maurice Sc\u00e8ve, Antoine Heroet, and Louise Lab\u00e9) and of Italians in exile (such as Luigi Alamanni and Gian Giorgio Trissino).\n\nIn 1572, Lyon was a scene of mass violence by Catholics against Protestant Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Two centuries later, Lyon was again convulsed by violence when, during the French Revolution, the citizenry rose up against the National Convention and supported the Girondins. The city was besieged by Revolutionary armies for over two months before surrendering in October 1793. Many buildings were destroyed, especially around the Place Bellecour, while Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois and Joseph Fouch\u00e9 administered the execution of more than 2,000 people. The Convention ordered that its name be changed to \"Liberated City\" and a plaque was erected that proclaimed \"Lyons made war on Liberty; Lyons no longer exists.\" A decade later, Napoleon ordered the reconstruction of all the buildings demolished during this period.\nThe Convention was not the only target within Lyon during the 1789-1799 French Revolution. After the National Convention faded into history, the French Directory appeared and days after the September 4, 1797, Coup of 18 Fructidor, a Directory's commissioner was assassinated in Lyon.\nThe city became an important industrial town during the 19th century. In 1831 and 1834, the canuts (silk workers) of Lyon staged two major uprisings for better working conditions and pay. In 1862, the first of Lyon's extensive network of funicular railways began operation.\nDuring World War II, Lyon was a centre for the occupying Nazi forces, including Klaus Barbie, the infamous \"Butcher of Lyon\". But the city was also a stronghold of the French Resistance \u2013 the many secret passages known as traboules enabled people to escape Gestapo raids. On 3 September 1944, Lyon was liberated by the 1st Free French Division and the Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur. The city is now home to a resistance museum.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne converge to the south of the historic city centre, forming a peninsula \u2013 the \"Presqu'\u00eele\" \u2013 bounded by two large hills to the west and north and a large plain eastward. Place Bellecour is located on the Presqu'\u00eele between the two rivers and is the third-largest public square in France. The broad, pedestrian-only Rue de la R\u00e9publique leads north from Place Bellecour.\nThe northern hill is La Croix-Rousse, known as \"the hill that works\" because it is traditionally home to many small silk workshops, an industry for which the city has long been renowned.The western hill is Fourvi\u00e8re, known as \"the hill that prays\" because it is the location for Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re basilica, several convents, and Archbishop residence. The district, Vieux Lyon, also hosts the Tour m\u00e9tallique (a highly visible TV tower, replicating the last stage of the Eiffel Tower) and one of the city's funicular railways. Fourvi\u00e8re, along with portions of the Presqu'\u00eele and much of La Croix-Rousse, is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.East of the Rh\u00f4ne from the Presqu'\u00eele is a large flat area upon which sits much of modern Lyon and contains most of the city's population. Situated in this area is La Part-Dieu urban centre, which clusters the landmark structures Tour Part-Dieu, Tour Oxyg\u00e8ne, and Tour Swiss Life, as well as the city's primary railway station, Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu.\nNorth of this district lays the sixth arrondissement, which is home to one of Europe's largest urban parks, the Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, as well as Lyc\u00e9e du Parc and Interpol's world headquarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLyon has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb) due to the higher average temperature being around 22 \u00b0C. But in modified classifications such as that of Trewartha, France's third largest city has an oceanic climate (Do).  The mean temperature in Lyon in the coldest month is 3.2 \u00b0C (37.8 \u00b0F) in January and in the warmest month in July is 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Precipitation is adequate year-round, at an average of 830 mm (32.7 in), but the winter months are the driest. The highest recorded temperature was 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) on 13 August 2003 while the lowest recorded temperature was \u221224.6 \u00b0C (\u221212.3 \u00b0F) on 22 December 1938.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nLike Paris and Marseille, the city of Lyon is divided into a number of municipal arrondissements, each of which is identified by a number and has its own council and town hall. Five arrondissements were originally created in 1852, when three neighbouring communes (La Croix-Rousse, La Guilloti\u00e8re, and Vaise) were annexed by Lyon. Between 1867 and 1959, the third arrondissement (which originally covered the whole of the Left Bank of the Rh\u00f4ne) was split three times, creating a new arrondissement in each case. Then, in 1963, the commune of Saint-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe was annexed to Lyon's fifth arrondissement. A year later, in 1964, the fifth was split to create Lyon's 9th \u2013 and, to date, final \u2013 arrondissement. Within each arrondissement, the recognisable quartiers or neighbourhoods are:\n\n1st arrondissement: Slopes of La Croix-Rousse, Terreaux, Martini\u00e8re/St-Vincent\n2nd arrondissement: Cordeliers, Bellecour, Ainay, Perrache, Confluence, Sainte-Blandine\n3rd arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (north), Pr\u00e9fecture, Part-Dieu, Villette, Dauphin\u00e9/Sans Souci, Montchat, Grange Blanche (north), Monplaisir (north)\n4th arrondissement: Plateau de la Croix-Rousse, Serin\n5th arrondissement: Vieux Lyon (Saint-Paul, Saint-Jean, Saint-Georges), Saint-Just, Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, Fourvi\u00e8re, Point du Jour, M\u00e9nival, Batti\u00e8res, Champvert (south)\n6th arrondissement: Brotteaux, Bellecombe, Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, Cit\u00e9 Internationale\n7th arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (south), Jean Mac\u00e9, Gerland\n8th arrondissement: Monplaisir (south), Bachut, \u00c9tats-Unis, Grand Trou/Moulin \u00e0 Vent, Grange Blanche (south), La\u00ebnnec, Mermoz, Monplaisir-la-Plaine\n9th arrondissement: Vaise, Duch\u00e8re, Rochecardon, St-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe, Gorge de Loup, Observance, Champvert (north)Geographically, Lyon's two main rivers, the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne, divide the arrondissements into three groups:\n\nTo the west of the Sa\u00f4ne, the fifth arrondissement covers the old city (Vieux Lyon), Fourvi\u00e8re hill and the plateau beyond. The 9th is immediately to the north, and stretches from Gorge de Loup, through Vaise to the neighbouring suburbs of \u00c9cully, Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or and Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or.\nBetween the two rivers, on the Presqu'\u00eele, are the second, first, and fourth arrondissements. The second includes most of the city centre,  Bellecour and Perrache railway station, and reaches as far as the confluence of the two rivers.

Lyon and its region Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes represent one of the most important economies in Europe and, according to Loughborough University, can be compared to Philadelphia, Mumbai or Athens with regard to its international position. The city of Lyon is working in partnership to more easily enable the establishment of new headquarters in the territory (ADERLY, Chambre du commerce et d'industrie, Grand Lyon...). High-tech industries such as biotechnology, software development, video game (Arkane Studios, Ivory Tower, Eden Games, EA France, Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe), and internet services are also growing. Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Lyon is home to the P4-Inserm\u2013ean Merieux Laboratory which conducts top-level vaccine research.The city is home to the headquarters of many large companies such as Groupe SEB, Sanofi Pasteur, Renault Trucks, Norbert Dentressangle, LCL S.A., Descours & Cabaud, Merial, Point S, BioM\u00e9rieux, Iveco Bus, Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne, GL Events, April Group, Boiron, Feu Vert, Panzani, Babolat, Euronews, Lyon Airports, LVL Medical, and inter-governmental agencies IARC, Interpol.\nThe specialisation of some sectors of activities has led to the creation of many main business centres:\nLa Part-Dieu, located in the 3rd arrondissement is the second biggest business quarter after La D\u00e9fense in Paris with over 1,600,000 m2 (17,222,256.67 sq ft) of office space and services and more than 55,000 jobs. Cit\u00e9 Internationale, created by the architect Renzo Piano is located in the border of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or in the 6th arrondissement. The worldwide headquarters of Interpol is located there. The district of Confluence, in the south of the historic centre, is a new pole of economical and cultural development.\nTourism is an important part of the Lyon economy, with one billion euros in 2007 and 3.5 million hotel-nights in 2006 provided by non-residents. Approximately 60% of tourists visit for business, with the rest for leisure. In January 2009, Lyon ranked first in France for hostels business. The festivals most important for attracting tourists are the F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res, the Nuits de Fourvi\u00e8re every summer, the Biennale d'art contemporain and the Nuits Sonores.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSince the Middle Ages, the region residents have spoken several dialects of Franco-Proven\u00e7al. The Lyonnais dialect was replaced by the French language as the importance of the city grew. However some \"frenchified\" Franco-Proven\u00e7al words can also be heard in the French of the Lyonnais, who call their little boys and girls \"gones\" and \"fenottes\" for example.\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers pioneered cinema in the town in 1895. The Institut Lumi\u00e8re, built as Auguste Lumiere's house, and a fascinating piece of architecture in its own right, holds many of their first inventions and other early cinematic and photographic artifacts.\n8 December each year is marked by the Festival of Lights (la F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res), a celebration of thanks to the Virgin Mary, who purportedly saved the city from a deadly plague in the Middle Ages. During the event, the local population places candles (lumignons) at their windows and the city of Lyon organizes impressive large-scale light shows onto the sides of important Lyonnais monuments, such as the medieval Cath\u00e9drale St-Jean.\nThe Saint Francis of Sales church is famous for its large and unaltered Cavaill\u00e9-Coll pipe organ, attracting audiences from around the world.\nThe Op\u00e9ra Nouvel (New Opera House) is the home of the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon. The original opera house was re-designed by the distinguished French architect Jean Nouvel between 1985 and 1993 and is named after him.\nLyon is also the French capital of \"trompe l'\u0153il\" walls, a very ancient tradition. Many are to be seen around the city. This old tradition is now finding a contemporary expression, for example in the art of Guillaume Bottazzi.\nThe Brothers of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic congregation that operates schools in Europe and North America, was founded in Lyon in 1821.\nThe African Museum of Lyon is one of the oldest museums situated in Lyon.\nThe Museum of Resistance and Deportation looks at the various individuals prominent in the Resistance movement in World War II. The building is strongly linked to Klaus Barbie. Lyon sees itself as the center of the French resistance and many members were shot in Place Bellecour in the town center. The exhibition is largely a series of mini-biographies of those involved.\nThe unusual project Lyon Dubai City, a reproduction of some districts of Lyon in Dubai, is a major point for tourism in Lyon.\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission Intercultural cities program.\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===\nThe Historic Site of Lyon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the \"exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.\" The specific regions comprising the Historic Site include the Roman district and Fourvi\u00e8re, the Renaissance district (Vieux Lyon), the silk district (slopes of Croix-Rousse), and the Presqu'\u00eele, which features architecture from the 12th century to modern times.\nBoth Vieux Lyon and the slopes of Croix-Rousse are known for their narrow passageways (named traboules) that pass through buildings and link streets on either side. The first examples of traboules are thought to have been built in Lyon in the 4th century. The traboules allowed the inhabitants to get from their homes to the Sa\u00f4ne quickly and allowed the canuts on the Croix-Rousse hill to get from their workshops to the textile merchants at the foot of the hill.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\n\nLyon has a long and chronicled culinary arts tradition. The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as \"the gastronomic capital of the world\", a claim repeated by later writers such as Bill Buford.  Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as Marie Bourgeois and Eug\u00e9nie Brazier developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favoured by the French elite; a tradition which Paul Bocuse later turned into a worldwide success.The bouchon is a traditional Lyonnais restaurant that serves local fare such as sausages, duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 or roast pork, along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the Beaujolais region to the north and the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne region to the south.  Another Lyon tradition is a type of brunch food called \"m\u00e2chons\", made of local charcuterie and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine. M\u00e2chons were the customary meal of the canuts, the city's silk workers, who ate a late-morning meal after they finished their shifts in the factories.Other traditional local dishes include coq au vin; quenelle; gras double; salade lyonnaise (lettuce with bacon, cro\u00fbtons and a poached egg); and the sausage-based rosette lyonnaise and andouillette. Popular local confections include marron glac\u00e9 and coussin de Lyon. Cervelle de canut (literally, \"silk worker's brains\") is a cheese spread/dip made of a base of fromage blanc, seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.\nMore recently, the french tacos was invented in Lyon suburbs in the early 2000s and is now worldwide famous.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nLyon is home to the football club Olympique Lyonnais (OL), whose men's team plays in Ligue 1 and has won the championship of that competition seven times, all consecutively from 2002 to 2008). OL played until December 2015 at the 43,000-seat Stade de Gerland, which also hosted matches of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.  Since 2016, the team has played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, a 59,000-seat stadium located in the eastern suburb of D\u00e9cines-Charpieu. OL operates a women's team, Olympique Lyonnais F\u00e9minin, which competes in and dominates Division 1 F\u00e9minine. They are on a streak of 13 top-flight championships (2007\u2013present), and additionally claim the four titles won by the original incarnation of FC Lyon, a women's football club that merged into OL in 2004 (the current FC Lyon was founded in 2009). The OL women have also won the UEFA Women's Champions League six times, including the two most recent editions in 2018 and 2019. Lyon will host the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Semi-Finals as well as the 7 July Final at Stade de Lyon.\nLyon has a rugby union team, Lyon OU, in the Top 14, which moved into Stade de Gerland full-time in 2017\u201318. In addition, Lyon has a rugby league side called Lyon Villeurbanne that plays in the French rugby league championship. The club's home is the Stade Georges Lyvet in Villeurbanne.\nLyon is also home to the Lyon Hockey Club, an ice hockey team that competes in France's national ice hockey league. The Patinoire Charlemagne is the seat of Club des Sports de Glace de Lyon, the club of Olympic ice dancing champions Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and world champions Isabelle Delobel and Olivier Shoenfelder. Lyon-Villeurbanne also has a basketball team, ASVEL, that plays at the Astroballe arena.\n\n\n=== Street art ===\nSince 2000, Birdy Kids, a group of graffiti artists from the city, has decorated several random buildings and walls along the Lyon ring road. In 2012, the artist collective has been chosen to represent the city as its cultural ambassadors.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of the city of Lyon proper was 491,268 at the January 2011 census, 14% of whom were born outside Metropolitan France.\n \n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and tertiary education ===\n\n\u00c9cole Centrale de Lyon;\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon\nEM Lyon (\u00c9cole de Management de Lyon);\nECE Lyon (\u00c9cole de Commerce Europ\u00e9enne de Lyon);\nInstitut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Lyon (Sciences Po Lyon);\nCPE Lyon;\nECAM Lyon (\u00c9cole Catholique d'Arts et M\u00e9tiers de Lyon);\nEPITECH;\nEPITA;\nENTPE (\u00c9cole Nationale des Travaux Publiques de l'\u00c9tat);\nESME-Sudria;\n\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts;\nE-Artsup;\nINSA Lyon (Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon);\nPolytech Lyon;\nInstitut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group;\nISARA (Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Agriculture Rh\u00f4ne Alpes);\nInstitution des Chartreux;\nInstitut polytechnique des sciences avanc\u00e9es;\nUniversit\u00e9 Claude Bernard (Lyon 1);\nUniversit\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re (Lyon 2);\nUniversit\u00e9 Jean Moulin (Lyon 3);\nIAE (Institut d'Administration des Entreprises de Lyon);\nInstitut Sup'Biotech de Paris;\nCatholic University of Lyon;\nESDES Business School;\nIDRAC (International School of Management);\nWesford Graduate Business School;\nIFAG (Business Management School);\nInstitut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action;\nLe Lyc\u00e9e du Parc;\nLa Martiniere Lyon;\nWeb@cademie;\nCEESO (Centre Europ\u00e9en d'Enseignement Sup\u00e9rieur de l'Ost\u00e9opathie);\nBellecour, Ecoles D'Arts.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThere are some international private schools in the Lyon area, including:\n\nCit\u00e9 Scolaire Internationale de Lyon or the Lyc\u00e9e de Gerland;\nIncludes the Section Japonaises (\u30ea\u30e8\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 Riyon Jeruran Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d \"Lyon Gerland Japanese Supplementary School\"), which the Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT) counts as a part-time Japanese supplementary school\nOmbrosa;\nInternational School of Lyon in nearby Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon;\nMontessori School of Lyon.\n\n\n=== Supplementary education ===\nOther Japanese supplementary schools:\n\nThe Association Pour le Developpement de la Langue et de la Culture Japonaises (ADLCJ; \u30ea\u30e8\u30f3\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 Riyon Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d) is held in the Maison Berty Albrecht in Villeurbanne, near Lyon. It was formed in 1987. It serves Japanese expatriate children who wish to continue their Japanese education whilst abroad.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport, located east of Lyon, serves as a base for domestic and international flights. It is a key transport facility for the entire Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, with coach links to other cities in the area. The in-house train station Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry connects the airport to the nationwide TGV network. The Rh\u00f4nexpress tram monopoly links the airport with the business quarter of La Part Dieu in less than 30 minutes, and offers connections with Underground A & B, Tramway T1, T3 & T4, and bus lines. Lyon public transport Sytral offers a bus service, Route 47, that links the airport to Meyzieu where passengers can change onto Tram T3. The regular price of public transport is \u20ac1.90, as opposed to \u20ac15 one way for the Rhonexpress. In the suburb of Bron, the smaller Lyon-Bron Airport provides an alternative for domestic aviation.\nLyon has two major railway stations: Lyon Part-Dieu, which was built to accommodate the TGV, and Lyon Perrache, an older station that now provides mostly regional service. Smaller railway stations include Gorge-de-Loup, Vaise, V\u00e9nissieux, Saint-Paul and Jean Mac\u00e9. Lyon was the first city to be connected to Paris by the TGV in 1981. Since that time the TGV train network has expanded and links Lyon directly to Perpignan, Toulouse, Nice, Marseille, Strasbourg, Nantes and Lille. International trains operate directly to Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Turin, Geneva, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels and London.\nThe city is at the heart of a dense road network and is located at the meeting point of several highways: A6 (to Paris); A7 (to Marseille); A42 (to Geneva); and A43 (to Grenoble). The city is now bypassed by the A46. A double motorway tunnel passes under Fourvi\u00e8re, connecting the A6 and the A7 autoroutes, both forming the \"Autoroute du Soleil\".\nLyon is served by the Eurolines intercity coach organisation. Its Lyon terminal is located at the city's Perrache railway station, which serves as an intermodal transportation hub for tramways, local and regional trains and buses, the terminus of Metro line A, of the Tramway T2, the bicycle service V\u00e9lo'v, and taxis.\n\nThe Transports en commun lyonnais (TCL), Lyon's public transit system, consisting of metro, tramways and buses, serves 62 communes of the Lyon metropolis. The metro network has four lines ( A   B   C   D ), 42 stations, and runs with a frequency of up to a train every 2 minutes. There are five Lyon tram lines ( T1  T2  T3  T4  T5) since April 2009: T1 from Debourg in the south to IUT-Feyssine in the north, Tram T2 from Perrache railway station to Saint-Priest in the south-east, Tram T3 from Part-Dieu to Meyzieu, Tram T4 from 'H\u00f4ptial Feyzin Venissieux' to Gaston Berger. Tram T5 from Grange Blanche, in the south-east to Eurexpo in the south-wast. The Lyon bus network consists of the Lyon trolleybus system, motorbuses, and coaches for areas outside the centre. There are also two funicular lines from Vieux Lyon to Saint-Just and Fourvi\u00e8re. The ticketing system is relatively simple as the city has only one public transport operator, the SYTRAL.\nThe public transit system has been complemented since 2005 by V\u00e9lo'v, a bicycle network providing a low-cost service where bicycles can be hired and returned at any of 340 stations throughout the city.  Borrowing a bicycle for less than 30 minutes is free. Free rental time can be extended for another 30 minutes at any station. Lyon was the first city in France to introduce this bicycle renting system. In 2011 the Auto'lib car rental service was introduced; it works much the same way as the Velo'v but for cars.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Lyon on a weekday is 45 minutes. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 17% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission \"Intercultural cities\" program.\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nLyon is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGallia Lugdunensis\nList of movies set in Lyon\nList of people from Lyon\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\nM\u00e8res of France\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website(in French)\nVisit Lyon, the official website for tourism in France\nLyon Tourist Office and Convention Bureau\nLyon\u2019s English Language News and Information",

        "wiki": "The Fort Saint-Andr\u00e9 is a medieval fortress in the commune of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement of France, dating from the first half of the 14th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe treaty of Paris, signed in 1229 at the end of the Albigensian Crusade, handed the French crown land to the west of the Rhone from Pont-Saint-Esprit to the Mediterranean and a joint interest in the city of Avignon. In 1290 the French king, Philip IV (Philippe-le-Bel or Philip the Fair), ceded his claim to Avignon to his father's cousin, Charles II of Naples who was the Count of Provence through his marriage to Beatrice of Provence.The Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Andr\u00e9 occupied a strategic position on Mount Andaon within sight of the town of Avignon which lay on the other side of the Rhone. Mount Andaon is a rocky outcrop with steep sides to the north and the east that rises 50 m above the floodplain of the Rhone. Prior to the 1770s the river flowed next to the base of the eastern side of the mount. The plateau at the top covers an area of around 3.5 hectare and extends for 220 m in an east-west direction and 160 m north-south. The top is not flat but rises from south to north by 24 m. The abbey was built at the eastern end of the plateau; the western end was occupied by a small village.The abbey had been founded at the end of the 10th century and possessed extensive property with over 200 churches spread over a wide area of southern France. In 1290 Philip IV instructed Adam de Montc\u00e9liard, the s\u00e9n\u00e9chal of Beaucaire, to negotiate an agreement with the abbey to cooperate in the defense of the right bank of the Rhone. The par\u00e9age treaty signed in 1292 specified that Philippe le Bel could build a fortress with a permanent garrison next to the abbey and a castle by the river. The abbey surrendered temporal power but obtained protection from the unwanted pressure from the city of Avignon which wished to control both banks of the Rhone. By 1302 fortifications, including an initial Tour Philippe-le-Bel, had been built at the western end of the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet which lay less than kilometer from the abbey. In 1309, Pope Clement V moved the papacy from Rome to Avignon.The fortress of Saint-Andr\u00e9, with the curtain wall that surrounded the abbey, was built in several stages during the first half of the 14th century. The surviving manuscripts do not allow the construction to be precisely dated. A ch\u00e2telain is mentioned in documents dating from 1314 and 1344, a guard is mentioned in 1318. The carved crest placed by the abbey above the entrance is dated 20 July 1367. This was probably when modifications were made to the entrance arch. The fortress was continually occupied by officers of the crown up to the time of French revolution.The fortress was clearly visible from Papal State across the Rhone in the town of Avignon and was intended to demonstrate the power of the Kingdom of France.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nThe Fort Saint-Andr\u00e9 is included as a monument historique by decrees of the 25 April 1903 and 14 November 1925. The site is regularly open to the public for a fee, though it receives a fraction of the visitors at the nearby Palais des Papes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in France\nTower of Philip the Fair - a contemporary construction only a few hundred meters from the castle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Fort Saint-Andr\u00e9 \u00e0 Villeneuve-lez-Avignon\".

          "Nice little visit with the kids, great views of surrounding areas. This fort is a nice visit without being anything special.",
          "As you enter through the fort gates you'll see a big sign 50 metres or so away for tickets. But that\u2019s not for the fort, it\u2019s for the Abbey and gardens. Tickets for the fort are immediately on your left in a building you could easily miss, no obvious sign. While the parapet",
          "We visited the Fort in August and it was very impressive. From the ramparts you get stunning panoramic views of Avignon and the surrounding countryside, including Mount Ventoux. Go early if its hot and also pay for the Abbye Saint Andre, which is within the Fort, its has lovely",
          "We were looking forward to visiting this fort. Once inside, it was rather disappointing. The only redeeming feature was the view back across the river looking at Avignon.",
          "We walked here from Avignon, and the walk itself wasn't massively enjoyable, as it was mostly along busy roads, so I would recommend driving (even though the walk is only 2.5km or so). However, the road approaching the fort/abbey is narrow and lined with charming Provincial",
          "Great example of medieval military architecture. It used to protect the then boudary of the Kingdom of France. Unfortunately, no open at sunset but until 6pm in summer (June1-Sept 30) and 5pm other months. Last tickets sold 45 minutes before closing. It does offer some of",
          "Set on the top of the hill above Villeneuve it\u2019s a pleasant, brisk uphill walk to get here. The historical ramparts are well preserved and you can walk around them. The most spectacular part is the views for miles all round. Brilliant views of Avignon, Mont Ventoux, Dentilles,",
          "Strange set up on approach as it's not clear that the fort and abbey are seperate. We did both and the abbey was wonderful whereas the fort left a lot to be desired and we didn't feel it was worth 6\u20ac pp. After visiting the Popes palace in Avignon and enjoying all the",
          "We chose to come here to get out of the city, a \u20ac22 taxi ride to the top of the hill. It takes about an hour to walk round and take in the sights. The descriptions of the place dotted about are not very informative, but that leaves plenty of room for your imagination. I found my",
          "Wandering these fort ruins, with its beautiful views back to the city and the papal palace was well worth an afternoon of time. There is a lovely garden there as well, and its close to an Abbey and the tower of Phillip the fair, so lots of things to do in the area. It was neat",
          "We walked from the town to the fort and it was a nice walk to the town as long as your don't mind the climb. The fort is imposing and you get a sense of how life was. The internal stairs are tiny there was no one there when we went, but I can't imagine how I would have felt",
          "The 8 euro admission was excessive to visit a wall around the top of a hill. Good views across to Avignon but these available from higher points of the town. Visit to the Abbey required additional 8 euro entrance to access other half of the site. Would not recommend.",
          "We saw the Fort Saint-Andre from the Palais Des Papes in Avignon and decided to make an adventure by hiking there. It took about one hour one way from the center of Avignon but the gardens and view were worth the sweat.",
          "These walls are solid and be prepared to get a good workout from the ascent/descent. Nice views of the surrounding area.",
          "Very little to see apart from a few pretty views. Walk around the battlements, little more than that. Price is reflective of lack of content.",
          "A lovely example of how life within walls would have been in the 14th century. 190 residences spread over 9 hectares, a lot of stonework still intact. The French certainly know how to build to last the test of time",
          "We went to Fort Saint-Andr\u00e9 and discovered you could buy a pass for (I think) 5 local historical attractions, so if you are going to be in the area for a day or two or plan to spend the whole day there, this pass may be worth it for you. It certainly was for us for just 17euro.",
          "We walked up to the fort and it is a hike in the sun but you can rest as you go along. The views are superb from the top. Gardens are fabulous. Highlight was a lovely lunch at the caf\u00e9 supplied by a very nice helpful lady.",
          "Only an hours walk from our apartment just outside the city walls, is this beautiful example of a medival castle with gardens in the Italian style. When we went in May there where only a hand full off people there which was a shame and made a big difference to the crowded city",
          "I enjoyed my visit to this historic Fort today. The entrance fee was 6 euros -- it takes maybe and hour or hour and half or so depending on your pace and amount of pictures. I got a brochure in English explaining the fort and history, I was told to go to the gate and let myself",
          "Visiting at the end of November, Fort Saint-Andre was almost empty. Just me and my husband, the staff, and lots of wind! Seriously, it was very windy. We paid for admission at the ticket office. (There are also toilets, and a few souvenirs to purchase at the ticket office.)",
          "We arrived on a very windy day and were told not everything was opened but we were sold tickets and told the man would meet us at the gate and let us in. The guy was sitting outside watching the view for well over 30 min to our knowledge ( with hindsight) we wandered around in",
          "Fort Saint-Andr\u00e9 is a 13th-century fortified castle on a rocky outcrop above the Rh\u00f4ne River. The castle served as a formidable fortress, as well as a symbol of French power. We explored the classic medieval castle gatehouse, where two imposing battlement-topped round towers",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this delightful, historic Fort today. It was interesting to visit and worth a visit if you are in the Villeneuve area however there isn\u2019t alot of information provided especially for foreign speaking tourists.",
          "If you don't like Fort Saint Andr\u00e9, you can't understand Avignon. Located in Villeneuve lez Avignon, just the opposite side of the Rh\u00f4ne river, this formidable fort overlooks the area and has THE view of Avignon not to miss. The gardens are far from being well kept, the",
          "I was pleasantly surprised that this monument was so much more than a walled \"fort\". My first impression was that it has been beautifully restored. The second was that it is enormous! And the views are picture-perfect. Lots of opportunity for creative photography. The",
          "Depending upon the location of your hotel, a stroll to Fort Saint-Andre can be a nice walk. However, should you be traveling in the area, there are far more interesting forts with a two hours' drive. In fact, the sights in Avignon are more attractive. To its credit, this fort",
          "A worthwhile hour if you're already staying in Villeneuve. Not worth a separate trip to Villeneuve unless you've weeks to spare in Provence.",
          "Nice break from the car ride south. The castle is outside of the busy centre of Avignon and the kids ( 3 and 6 loved the tour across the stairs and on top of the towers. Takes you about 1,5 for the full tour.",
          "Beautiful view of Avignon and panorama of the valley! Nice walk around the inner walls of the fort! You can visit inside and outside the fort. The kids enjoyed climbing up and down the many steps to get around the fort! You can easily imagine how life was like in the 13th",
          "Across the river from Avignon, and embedded in a giant old fortress are spectacular gardens with views forever....",
          "This amazingly well-preserved fort in Villeneuve is just across the river from Avignon. It has spectacular views from the ramparts which are easily accessible.",
          "Great to go through and take your time walking everywhere. Beautiful views from towers as well. Very cute chapel too...a must stop on your walk around Villeneuve-les-Avignon...",
          "This is part of a three way ticket with the abbey gardens and Chartreuse. There is a little map to follow and some things to see. It's ok but definite not a must see. The view of the fort from afar is much more impressive.",
          "Worth going, historically interesting and well presented. Top of the hill (obviously) so good exercise to get there. Garden within also worth a visit.",
          "When we arrived we were handed an information sheet to read (in English) but there wasn't much to learn about the place. It was interesting and there was a clear route round for visitors but not many of them. Also there were no toilets! The journey to reach the fort was almost",
          "a medieval ruin,not much to see from the internal walk apart from what you see on the outside. The adjoining sites are very much better.",
          "Steeped in history, great views, lots of steps. No Audios available,fantastic history and great way to learn about the area.",
          "Fort St. Andre commands a hill overlooking the Rhone River and Avignon. It is well-preserved and provides commanding views of the area.",
          "Visited the fort with a triple ticket (Chartreuse, Fort & Abbaye &Jardins). This was perhaps the weakest of the three in entertainment value, but what the inside was lacking in exhibits, the outside made up in spectacular views.",
          "This is not an expensive place to visit. I would give it three and a half stars if I could. There is not much to see inside the building although the photos of trees (mostly of places in England!) were beautiful. The gardens are lovely and there are spectacular views of the",
          "Wonderful walk up to the fort. The views of surrounding countryside are breathtaking. A must visit affroding wonderful photos",
          "Had another look round the Fort as we had bought a triple ticket (Chartreuse, Fort & Abbaye &Jardins). The views from the battlements are great and there is some interesting graffiti from previous occupants. If you are not keen on heights or spiral staircase you probably miss",
          "The fort itself has little to go for inside, but the views of Avignon are magnificent. The combination with La Chartreuse is worth a half-day visit. Pity that the gardens of St Andr\u00e9 require a different (quite pricy) entrance ticket.",
          "Worth the walk uphill as it offers scenic views to the village of Villeneuve-les-Avignon and Avignon itself. A small gift-shop and interesting exhibitions. In November hosted a photo-exhibition of Nikos Aliagas.",
          "We took a cab from Avignon and arranged for us to be picked up an hour or so later. It was definitely worth the trip. When visiting be prepared for walking on cobblestones and for many stairs. The 14th century fort has an interesting history and was a very important",
          "Nice reconstruction and some nice unreconstructed areas. Beautiful views of the surrounding area. Wonderful for a visit on a sunny day.",
          "With our friends, free entry on the annual day of heritage, a good 3/4 hour spent in enjoying this castle. Built in the 14c, lots of stairs but the views from the top are excellent, especially over the Rhone to Avignon.",
          "The fort is a little bit away from downtown. However worth it. Loved the old roman type architecture and also the incredible views from the hill top. If you visit this town this is the place to go to aside from the center, town square.",
          "This place is split between two sights and owners. We visited the right hand side. It was worth the fee. It had great views of Avignon and lovely gardens to walk around. The building itself was impressive. I'm sure the right side is excellent as well.",
          "We visited this on the last day of a mistral!! Loved it! The views are breathtaking from the slopes of the southern alps (complete with snow caps) the Luberon range to the old town of Avignon so much of interest. Add to this, lovely little nooks and crannies at all sorts of",
          "We saw a poster in our hotel advertising guided tours of the fort in July and August at 9 pm with lanterns. We had to call to reserve spots (check with Avignon tourist office) and paid 8 euros for adults (free for children 8-12). The tour is only in French but the guide we had",
          "We bought a double ticket to this and the abbey, but if you have limited time I would recommend giving this a miss. There are great views from the ramparts.",
          "Reasonable price to get in, and can be linked with gardens etc on a \"Village Pass\" (not sure of correct title for it!) Fantastic views from ramparts....was very hot day when we went though!",
          "Gardens were closed still the view from the wall awesome. Except for the view though... not something that cannot be skipped.",
          "An absolutely stunning place with a fascinating history and incredibly beautiful gardens. You can buy a picnic lunch and wine here and eat it in the gardens with the beautiful view of Avignon across the water. The gardens are stunning and it is lovely to wander around,",
          "Tourist office recommended this so walked up the steep hill about 10 minutes only to find it was closed until 2pm for a private function. Gardens were open but not a patch on Giverny though maybe a little early in the season.",
          "Went to the gardens and Abbeye first and was at one stage not going to bother with the fort ..glad I changed my mind ....it was very interesting historically and even though the Mistral was blowing the views were great looking back to Avignon and around the surrounding area",
          "Very old and some of the ruins have been restored while maintaining the original style. Definately wear walking shoes, your feet will thank you.",
          "It is well worth walking up to the fort. The walls are huge and you get a good sense of how secure it must have been in olden times if you walk around. There is some English signage though not as much as I would have liked.",
          "A large 12th century fortress overlooking the small town of Villeneuve les Avignon. Lots of steps and uneven ground, would not recommend it to visitors who had difficulty walking. The fortress had great strategic significance in the middle ages as it overlooked the whole region",
          "We saw the castle on the hilltop and went inside to see what was there - parking was free. It was originally a monastery, then taken over by military as a fortress and various parts were abused and ruined, then a French woman took it over and designed lavish gardens to",
          "The Fort St Andre is above the Chartreuse, so if you go to one it's well worth walking up to the other. Well preserved fort from the middle ages and the views over Avignon from the tops of the towers are amazing.",
          "There is only a self-guided tour of this ruined fort but everything is well signed. After climbing to the summit, we visited the charming little chapel and then you are on the ramparts from where there are stunning views of the Rhone valley Finally, you descend down one of the",
          "It is wonderful to wander around inside the fort. The views from the walls is fantastic. You are left to your own devices, so a little research before could enhance your visit.",
          "We got a ticket to the fort for 1\u20ac after buying a combo pass at the La Chartereuse Monastery. It's a beautiful, imposing structure on the other side of the Rh\u00f4ne River that separates Villeneuve from Avignon. The spectacular Gardens started with residences of 12 cardinals who",
          "I was glad we made the effort to visit the fort. Fabulous views from the top. A lot of steps but one can miss these and the other can take the steps if they are able. Interesting seeing the prisoners quarters.",
          "Spent a good while walking over from central Avignon across the rhone through a dead quiet town to find once again.. 'out to lunch.' So after a half hour wait, enjoying the view I got into the ruin. For the money there isn't a lot to see but the view. The paths are unkept",
          "We walked up the hill from our hotel to this lovely high spot in town, with great views of the surrounding area, including across the river to Avignon, all impressive...definitely worth an afternoon visit.",
          "Excellent gardens to walk round, very well maintained inside and outside. Gtreat views of surrounding area from the towers.",
          "The fort and the view were very rewarding. See the medieval toilet among other interesting things left from those old days. Use your imagination to bring you back in time.",
          "Delightful hike up to the Fort- wonderful views as you go along. Best feeling of being in the community and residences as you walk from the Centre Ville",
          "Oh, it was worth a climb... The sweeping vistas of Avignon and the Papal Palace are so magnificent from the old walls of this remarkably preserved fortress... totally different impression of this from the distance than the close look in Avignon itself. The views of charming",
          "Well worth visiting if mobile, fantastic views over to Avignon and building itself is well preserved. Could have a little more information on site itself.",
          "The Fort is worth a visit if you have time. I preferred the Chartreuse and the Abbaye jardins but enjoyed the Fort too. For people less able you may find it a struggle as the paths are uneven and their are a lot of steep steps up and down. The views from the top are fabulous and",
          "The walls and stonework of this fort are in magnificent condition and the visitor is impressed by the scale of the works and the strategic dominance of the fort, situated on the crest of the highest hill in the vicinity and commanding wonderful views across the lush countryside",
          "The ancient fortified area of Villeneuve-les-Avignon is well-preserved, especially the gardens. While a lot was destroyed by wars, and by near-sighted owners in the 1800's, there is still a lot to see.",
          "Amazing historical building, already worth looking at the outside. Villeneuve les Avignon is a beautiful village",
          "very well preserved beautiful building. nice to stroll around the gardens and take in the amazing views over the city. the only small draw back is there is not much information posted., however a guide book is available. very nice cafe at the entrence to sit at and enjoy a glass",
          "Well worth the visit. Amazing history and wonderful views across the countryside and to Avignon from the top of the fort.",
          "As everyone is visiting Avignon and Palais des Papes, almost everyone ignores this little gem on the other side of the river Rh\u00f4ne. True, it is nothing like the grandeur of Palais des Papes, but it is nevertheless worth the visit. With a reasonable income price, everyone could",
          "Lots of walking, much of it on rather rough stoney ground, but a fascinating visit, well worth the trip. I loved it!",
          "The views from the fort are astounding and give a feel of the importance of its site in commanding the French border with the Empire.",
          "The walk up the hill is rugged and strenuous on a hot day. It's wonderful when you get up their and enjoy the views on a walk around the ramparts. I think we missed going to the first tower on the right. The sign says 'next' which I thought it meant to go after, but it really",
          "I could see this place from Avignon and wondered what it was. It is just a short bus ride away. Number 5 bus from the Avignon bus stop then a short walk up the hill. Entrance discount with the Avignon Pass. It is a great place. I went on a Saturday and there was only about 10",
          "Great little fort with excellent views towards Avignon and the river. Very good entrance price of \u20ac5.50 per person.",
          "... If a little strenuous in the midday sun! The Fort occupied a strategically important point in the Middle Ages, and the views around show quite how that worked: the Rhone, the town of Villeneuve, Avignon are all there to be seen on the walk round some impressive ramparts and",
          "Thanks France for keeping your pieces of history so enjoyable for tourists and locals so many years after.",
          "As I could see not many people are visiting these magnificient castle on the other side of river Rhone just across Avignon. I think IT Is worth of visit not only because of excelent view to Avignon but to understand history of disputes between France and Popes of Avignon.",
          "Another magnificent piece of architecture with stunning views back to Avignon across the Rhone and the Island. Beautiful garden landscapes with many paths to explore leading up to the the chapel at the top. Well worth the hike across the river from Avignon.",
          "Not only is the building itself stunning, very well preserved and spectacular landmark, but you can watch or hours the valley and the Avignon city as it is a perfect sightseeing spot. Tip: go there to watch the fireworks on 14th of July !",
          "From the central square with lots of cafes you continue uphill past delightfully restored, or crumbling buildings to the Fort, wear sturdy foot gear as the route is very insecure. Not crowded and a magical view from the uppermost levels.",
          "We caught the bus from just outside the Post Office and it took us out of Avignon and over the river in about 15 minutes. Much better than walking in the heat, especially as there is still a big walk up the hill to the fort once you arrive in Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon. Take bottled",
          "The highlight is to get on the top of the old fort! You can easily imagine the old fight, the soldier and as a LOTR fan, multiple war scenes come to mind! Highly recommend! The view is good but not the main reason I love it!",
          "This was built by the French King after the Pope's Palace/ fort compound was built across the river by the then independent kingdom of Provance. Great distant views of Popes Palace and Avignon from here.",
          "OK, the fort is on a hillside and dominates the city and as such offers a great photo opportunity. However, for any keen photographer, the Abbey grounds in our opinion offers the better opportunities. Would not say it is not worth visiting but if pushed for time, the Abbey and",
          "The Fort Saint-Andre is an imposing and well preserved fortification overlooking Villeneuve and with dramatic views of Avignon and the surrounding countryside. It occupies a privileged position and repays the uphill walk from the town centre. The pretty streets offer countless",
          "This was a very interesting trip. Quite a walk to get up the hill, but there is parking for those who drive. A good tour around the walls, the chapel and the towers. Great views from the tops of the towers towards Avignon. Interesting history too.",
          "What a delightful place to relax, unwind and smell the roses (literally) in a pretty piece of history. I walked over from Avignon, enjoying the charming buildings as I went up the hill past the Phillipe Le Bel Tower. Being windy in Avignon, as it often is, the gardens were a",

          "We spent more than an hour walking around and in buildings within the fort. Amazing as it is empty of artifacts. But so fun to walk on the old wall and in the old buildings. We imagined ourselves living 800 years ago. If you like really old sites you might like this. If you're",
          "Having seen this from Avignon, decided to spend final day of Avignon stay on the other side of the river. From this interesting Fort you get a different view of Avignon and a history lesson at the same time if you read the information leaflet. The chapelle in the grounds is",
          "Wonderful medieval fort in Villenueve-les-Avignon overlooking the entire area. We walked along the inner wall through well maintained gardens, visited a small chapel & up the turrets to the upper walkway. Many rooms to explore. The Number 5 Bus takes you to the start of the",
          "Very cool fort, with the towers and ramparts in great condition. the gardens in the abbey are nice too.",
          "We ventured to the fort via the Chartreuse. It was a bit steep, but the view from the fort overlooking the palais des papes is spectacular. The Italian gardens & olive groves are very pleasant.",
          "....but was not disappointed. Breathtaking views awaited. Incredible architecture, history, gardens, peacefulness. Lovely woman at the admissions desk; and later upon leaving, delightful man filling in for her. Not to be missed in Villeneuve-les-Avignon.",
          "The fort is a great experience, away from the tourist masses of Avignon (don't miss the opportunity to stroll though Villeneuve-les-Avignon itself, similarly tourist-free). It can get very hot and dry up there so bring a drink, but the view from the towers is breathtaking.",
          "Walls are in good shape and its a relaxed visit in your own time. The views of Avignon from up here are spectacular, a climb up and wander along the ramparts is well worth it.",
          "Just across the river from Avignon is Villeneuve-les-Avignon, where you will find Fort Saint-Andre. Built in the 13th and 14th century it was commissioned by Philipe le Bel in 1292. It is a bit of climb but you will not be disappointed on reaching the top. A magnificently",
          "With the masses of history to be had in Avignon itself, it's easy to see how and why nowhere near as many visitors get across to Villeneuve-les-Avignon. However, it is an absolute must! This fort is extremely well preserved and also has some lovely gardens and an abbey to walk",

          "First of all, Villeneuve is a relatively undiscovered jewel in this area. The town square is lovely and you can feel a certain French quality of life in the place. A must if you want to escape the crowds over the river. My four year old son and I really enjoyed exploring the",
          "Visting Fort Saint-Andre was the perfect thing to do on our first day in Villeneuve-les-Avignon. I am a big fan of ruins and historic sites and I was surprised at the size of the fort and by how much I could walk through (and on top of). When buying our tickets we also",
          "I love being up high, and this is about as high as it gets in this part of France. Be warned, there are plenty of steps, but the views are worth it. The tiny Bellevue Chapel is a gem. Buy a combined ticket with Chartreuse for the best value.",

          "This a stunning place to visit. The fort is still in very good condition. I thought it was very interesting to walk along those paths, visit dungeon and towers. The view over Avignon is beautiful. The only disappointment is regarding explanations. No boards, no explanations, no",
          "Yes, well it was just half-a-fort with little of interest. More investment needed on the interiors. Lovely views from the ramparts",

          "We took the number 5 bus which stops not so far from saint bezenet bridge. Took less than 10 minutes to arrive in front of the tourist office from where we walked up to the fortress. The town is very beautiful, there were no other tourists around. The entrance fee was cheap and",

Its collections include Parisian furniture, faience from Marseille and Moustiers, metalwork, tapestries and paintings.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 26 November 1872 at Hy\u00e8res, Mathilde de Thyseba\u00ebrt married Marie Xavier Arthur de Villeneuve-Esclapon, who in 1877 became secretary-general for the department of Vaucluse. In 1879 Mathilde bought an estate next to the rue Saint-Dominique (now the rue Victor-Hugo) in Avignon, where she built a h\u00f4tel particulier. The couple lived there for a time before selling it to Marie Camp in 1897. After Camp's death it was bought on 14 November 1927 by the industrialist and collector Louis Vouland to house his collections. On his death on 28 November 1973, he left the building and his collections to the Fondation de France to become a museum. \n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== Furniture ===\n\n\n=== Ceramics ===\n\n\n==== Non-French faience ====\n\n\n==== French faience ====\n\n\n===== Moustiers =====\n\n\n===== Marseille =====\n\n\n===== Other =====\nThe museum also exhibits faience from outside Provence, such as that made in Niderviller, Strasbourg, Lyon and Montpellier.\n\n\n=== Metalwork ===\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\n\n=== Prints ===\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\n\n== Selected exhibitions ==\n25 June - 30 October 2011 : \u00ab La collection Dumon \u00bb, Fondation Regards de Provence\n23 June - 28 October 2012 : \u00ab SPH (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 protectrice de l'humour), 10 ans d'expositions de dessins d'humour en Avignon de 1967 \u00e0 1976 \u00bb\nsummer 2013 : \u00ab Lumi\u00e8res \u00bb, R\u00e9gis Mathieu and his 'Galerie Lumi\u00e8res'\n28 June - 26 October : \u00ab R\u00eaves d'un collectionneur \u00bb\n18 June \u2013 6 September 2015 : \u00ab Jean-Henri Fabre (1823-1915), l\u2019art dans la nature \u00bb\n2 June \u2013 2 October 2016 : \u00ab Victor Vasarely, Multiplicit\u00e9 \u00bb\n2 June \u2013 1 October 2017 : \u00ab Hortus 2.0, acte 1 \u00bb, EDIS (commissaire d\u2019exposition)\n1 December 2017 \u2013 13 May 2018 : \u00ab Promenade dans la lumi\u00e8re de Vaucluse \u00bb\n3 July \u2013 4 November 2018 : \u00ab Le temps suspendu \u00bb\n21 February \u2013 9 June 2019 : \u00ab Yuan Chin-Taa, l\u2019art est un jeu \u00bb\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMus\u00e9e Louis Vouland, Avignon, fondation Louis Vouland, 2014, 120 p.

          "My wife and I were looking for something else to see in Avignon while our friends toured the former papal palace. The museum, set in an old Avignon mansion, offers an experience as if you are visiting someone's home from the early 1800's. The period furniture is not roped off,",
          "We used to be neighbours so it became my local museum, always following what was going on - and the curator never stops inventing themed events and visiting exhibitions, always so well done and informative. The museum had an evening celebrating renovations that had taken place",
          "Visited this museum partly because it was raining, and partly because I am interested in interior decor and wanted to see the inside of the house in which the museum is located. However, for 4 Euros (discounted with the Avignon pass) I expect more. The museum consists of one",
          "This is an elegant little museum in what was once a private house. Downstairs, in an annexe, there was a temporary exhibit of an extensive naturist collection. Drawings of mushrooms and butterfly collections. Interesting. Upstairs is where the real collection is. Louis",
          "This was a lovely surprise. It was easy to imagine how people lived here, with decadent furnishings and personal property throughout the rooms. We were surprised not to have to pay for the pleasure of seeing a lovely home with so much accessible history.",
          "This was a private collection gifted to the city, so very eclectic with some surprising rooms, like the Chinese lounge which was decorated all in red. Some changes have been made since it became a museum and the bedrooms have been given up to an awkward display of porcelain.",

        "wiki": "Tour Philippe-le-Bel (English: Tower of Philip the Fair) is a medieval tower in Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon which marked the French terminus of the Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet Bridge across the Rhone between the Kingdom of France and Papal territory of Avignon. It is named after the French king Philippe-le-Bel (Philip IV \"the Fair\") who was responsible for its construction.\nA tower with only two storeys was completed in 1302. In spite of protests from the Count of Provence and the population of Avignon, Philippe-le-Bel pressed ahead and built a gatehouse at the end of the bridge. The tower and gatehouse formed part of a fortress with a curtain wall that enclosed several buildings including a chapel and a residence for the ch\u00e2telain. A third storey was added to the tower in the middle of the 14th century.\nThe Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet Bridge was abandoned in 1669 and the fortress then ceased to serve any useful function. The French crown continued to pay for repairs, but after the French Revolution the buildings were abandoned and allowed to fall into ruins. In 1822 the town of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon decided to demolish all of the fortress except the present tower. It was listed as a Monument historique in 1862 and is now open to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe treaty of Meaux-Paris, signed in 1229 at the end of the Albigensian Crusade, handed the French crown land on the right bank of the Rh\u00f4ne from Pont-Saint-Esprit to the Mediterranean and a joint interest in the city of Avignon. In 1290 the French king, Philip IV (Philip the Fair), ceded his claim to Avignon to his father's cousin, Charles II of Naples who was the Count of Provence through his marriage to Beatrice of Provence. As a consequence Philip gave up his share of the strategic Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet Bridge across the Rhone which had been built between 1177 and 1185 by the city of Avignon.The Languedoc end of the bridge was within a kilometer of the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Andr\u00e9 on Mount Andaon. The abbey had been founded at the end of the 10th century and possessed extensive property with over 200 churches spread over a wide area of southern France. In 1290 Philip IV instructed Adam de Montc\u00e9liard, the s\u00e9n\u00e9chal of Beaucaire, to negotiate an agreement with the abbey to cooperate in the defense of the right bank of the Rhone. The par\u00e9age treaty was signed in 1292. It meant that the abbey surrendered temporal power but obtained protection from the unwanted pressure from the city of Avignon which wished to control both banks of the Rh\u00f4ne.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe 1292 treaty specified that the king could construct a fortress at the western end of the bridge. By 1302, a two-storey fortified tower had been completed. This initial construction work almost certainly included the building of a curtain-wall, a well, a bread oven, a kitchen and some form of lodging for the ch\u00e2telain and the guards.Charles II, Count of Provence objected to the position of the new fortress and wrote letters protesting that the foundations of the tower were right next to the bridge which was built on his property. In spite of his objections, in 1307 work began on the construction of a gatehouse over the roadway at the end of the bridge. This provoked strong opposition by the inhabitants of Avignon who occupied the tower. Eventually, 9 months later in August 1308 a peaceful settlement was reached allowing the gatehouse to be completed. In March of the following year (1309), Pope Clement V moved from Rome to Avignon.\nThe fortress was overlooked by the nearby Massif des Anges and the Colline des Mourgues making it difficult to defend. Around 1350, during the reign of either Philip IV or his successor John II, an additional storey was added to the tower with a rectangular turret on the top. The tower was crowned with machicolations. A narrow cylindrical watchtower was added at a later date, perhaps in the 16th century.During the period of the Avignon Papacy the fortress saw much activity with high ranking church officials, princes and notables crossing the bridge. Between 1320 and 1350 several cardinals built palaces in Villeneuve, across the bridge from the papal palace in Avignon. On a number of occasions sections of the bridge were destroyed when the Rh\u00f4ne flooded. The bridge then became impassable and the river had to be crossed by ferry. The harbour on the right bank was at the base of the tower. Eighteenth century drawings show that access to both the fortress and the harbour was controlled by gates on the path leading up from the river bank along what is now the Mont\u00e9e de la Tour.When the Avignon bridge was finally abandoned in 1669, the fortress no longer served any useful function. It was nevertheless still maintained but in 1777 a government engineer wrote a short report proposing that the fortress be abandoned. Probably, as a result, in 1787, Quintin de Beuverd, captain of the Corps Royal du G\u00e9nie, produced a detailed report on the state of the buildings. It included a plan and concluded that the buildings were not required by the king. These events were overtaken by the French Revolution in 1789 but the surviving documents allow historians to study the layout of the fortress.\n\n\n=== Neglect and partial demolition ===\nWith the Revolution the fortress became national property and was no longer maintained. In 1804 the fortress was ceded to the hospice d'Uz\u00e8s as compensation for other property that had been confiscated and sold. Although the hospice had no interest in the monument, in 1808 the Gard pr\u00e9fecture refused to allow it to be put up for sale and as a result the monument became a ruin and was vandalised. A hole in the wall of the tower was used to anchor the chain ferry that carried passengers across the Rhone. From 1821 the commune of Villeneuve rented the monument from the hospice until finally in 1842 the French king, Louis Philippe I, signed a bill authorising the commune to acquire the tower and its dependencies.From 1821 the town of Villeneuve had effective control of the monument without actually owning it,  but instead of repairing the buildings, the town claimed that the ruined structures around the tower posed a hazard and in 1822 ordered them to be demolished and the material sold to cover the costs. In 1834 part of the limestone rock around tower was cut away to create a new access route to the port on the Rh\u00f4ne. Some of the stone was used to construct the quay, the rest was supplied to lime kilns. The tower is now the only part of the medieval fortress that survives. The construction of roads and a car-park have obliterated almost all traces of the surrounding buildings, but fortunately, the many documents and pictures that survive in the archives can be used to study the details of the original structure.The tower was listed as a Monument historique in 1862.\n\n\n== Surviving tower ==\n\nThe tower is the only surviving element of the original fortress. It sits on a sloping rocky base and has an irregular quadrilateral plan with average dimensions of 13.4 by 15.7 m (44 by 52 ft). It is built of limestone blocks that would have been brought by boat from a quarry near the base of Fort Saint-Andr\u00e9. The exterior walls of the ground floor and most of the first floor are constructed using rusticated ashlar (bossage).There are three floors with a single large room on each floor. The ceilings are 7.5 m (25 ft) in height. The floors are connected by a well-conserved narrow spiral staircase only 1 m (3 ft 3 in) in width located in the northwest corner of the building. The stairs are protected at the top by a rectangular turret. On the first two levels of the staircase there are slots in the external wall to admit light. The roof terrace is 27 m (89 ft) above the ground. The turret projects another 7 m (23 ft) and the lookout tower extends a further 5 m (16 ft) giving a total height of 39 m (128 ft) for the structure. The walls are 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) in thickness on the ground floor, 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) on the first floor and 2.0 m (6 ft 7 in) on the second.The tower has been subject to a series of modifications over the centuries. The lower two floors were completed by 1302 while the third floor was added in around 1350. The watchtower was added in the 15th or 16th century, and in the 18th century some of the openings were blocked up. In addition, some changes were made during restoration work in the 20th century. Areas of protruding stonework on the north and east sides the tower appear to be the remains of the bonding of a defensive curtain wall. On the east side there is a doorway that may have provided access to a walkway along the top of the wall, while on the north side a similar doorway has been blocked up, presumably at an early date, and fitted with an arrowslit. There is no evidence that a curtain wall at these positions was ever actually constructed and it is possible that the wall formed part of an original plan that was never realized. On the west wall of the tower there are two blocked doorways connecting to the spiral staircase. These are likely to have been used to access garderobes (latrines).On the east face of the tower there are three carved crests under a hood mould. Although they are not clearly interpretable, the upper two are almost certainly those of the king of France and the Abbey of Saint-Andr\u00e9. The third crest, which has what appears to be an oblique row of three roses, is probably that of Pope Clement VI who purchased the town of Avignon from Joanna I of Naples in 1348.\n\n\n=== Ground floor ===\nThe ground floor of the tower was probably occupied by the guards. There is a small entrance on the north side which is protected by the bret\u00e8che on the exterior and a murder-hole above the entrance passage. The room has a ribbed quadripartite vault in two bays springing from corbels. The corbels are undecorated but the two ceiling bosses are carved with rosettes of acanthus leaves. The room is lit by six openings, four of which are placed in niches provided with stone benches. The only window is in a niche in the east wall and would have provided a view towards the bridge. The five other openings are arrowslits. A large recessed fireplace has a chimney which is completely contained within the thickness of the north wall. In the summer it would have been closed off by thick wooden shutters.Some of the walls have traces of wall paintings. Above the fireplace there is the outline of a man's head in bright colours that must have once formed part of a larger design. In two of the arched niches, and also barely visible on the west wall, there is an interlocking hexagonal pattern in red ochre lines that is decorated with foliage curling around a large rose with five petals. The design is similar to that used to decorate the interior of several other building in the area that date from the same period.\n\n\n=== First floor ===\nThe high quality of the carving in the first floor room indicates that it was designed to serve as the main reception area. The rib vaulting is divided into two bays as on the ground floor but the six corbels and the ceiling bosses are decorated with finely carved busts or foliage. The room is lit by six openings set in niches. Of these four are windows and only two are arrowslits. The fireplace is set into the west wall.There is a second entrance with modest dimensions in the east wall. On the outside of the building the doorway is positioned above some projecting stonework that may have been intended as the bonding to a curtain wall that was never built. The entrance was perhaps originally served by a wooden staircase but when the gatehouse was constructed it gave direct access to the ch\u00e2telain's residence. The doorway and four of the niches were blocked at the beginning of the 18th century when the two upper floors of the tower was used as a prison. They were unblocked as part of the restoration work carried out in the 1970s.\n\n\n=== Second floor ===\nWhen the second floor was added to the tower in the middle of the 14th century, the sloping ridged roof of the earlier terrace was retained and became the floor of the new room. The rib vaulting is divided into three bays instead of two as on the lower two floors. The carved corbels and ceiling bosses are less skilful executed that those on the first floor. The room was originally lit by openings in six niches of which two were windows and four were arrowslits. Those with arrowslits were blocked when the tower was used as a prison and have not been reopened. The arches of the niches differ from those on the lower floors; they have an ogive shape rather than a semi-circular form. The fireplace is set into the north wall. There is an entrance to a garderobe in the southwest corner of the room. The position is surprising as it would have been almost above the quarters of the ch\u00e2telain and it is possible that the structure was originally a bartizan which was converted into a garderobe when the upper floors were used as a prison.\n\n\n=== Terrace ===\nThree sides of the terrace have machicolations with a parapet supported on large corbels. At the corners there are semi-cylindrical corbelled turrets (bartizans) to allow the defenders to observe the sides of the tower. The crenellation of the parapet dates from the restoration work carried out in the 1980s.The tower is owned by the commune of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and is open to the public. The room on the ground floor is used to hold art exhibitions. The first floor room houses an exhibition on the history of the Tour Philippe-le-Bel and the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\n\n\n== Pictorial record ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nFort Saint-Andr\u00e9, a castle less than 1 km (0.62 mi) north of the tower.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Tour Philippe le Bel\", www.tourisme-villeneuvelezavignon.fr (in French), Office de Tourism, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, retrieved 19 June 2013.",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

        "wiki": "Louis I (Italian: Luigi, Aloisio or \"Ludovico\" ; 1320 \u2013 26 May 1362), also known as Louis of Taranto, was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou who reigned as King of Naples, Count of Provence and Forcalquier, and Prince of Taranto.\nLouis gained the crown of Naples by marrying his first cousin, Queen Joanna I, whose prior husband, Andrew, had died as a result of a conspiracy that may have involved both of them. Immediately after securing his status as her co-ruler, Louis successfully wrested away all power from his wife, leaving her a sovereign in name only. Their disastrous marriage resulted in the birth of two daughters, Catherine and Frances, neither of whom survived their parents. During their joint reign, Louis dealt with numerous uprisings, attacks, and unsuccessful military operations; he is generally considered an inefficient monarch. Following his death, Joanna resumed her power and refused to share it with her subsequent husbands.\n\n\n== Background and family ==\nA member of the Capetian House of Anjou, Louis was born in Naples as the second son of Philip I, Prince of Taranto, and Catherine of Valois. He was a patrilineal first cousin once removed of both Queen Joanna I of Naples and her husband Andrew, Duke of Calabria, in addition to being Joanna's maternal first cousin. Louis' older brother Robert, Prince of Taranto, was having an open affair with Queen Joanna. When the 17-year-old Andrew was assassinated on 18 September 1345 for seeking to co-reign with his wife, Joanna was immediately suspected of ordering the murder with the help of Louis and Robert.Following her husband's death, the young queen was strongly influenced by Robert, but by October 1346, she had become closer to Louis. The brothers' mother died the same month, leaving her claim to the Latin Empire to Robert, who in turn ceded the Principality of Taranto to Louis.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\n\nLouis and Joanna married in Naples on 22 August 1347, without seeking dispensation from Pope Clement VI \u2013 necessary because of their being closely related. The marriage was an attempt to secure the kingdom for Louis rather than to pacify the belligerent branches of the House of Anjou.\n\n\n=== Ascension to power ===\nThe couple fled to Provence, which Joanna ruled as countess, after King Louis I of Hungary invaded Naples to avenge the murder of his brother Andrew. They met Clement, feudal overlord of the Kingdom of Naples, in Avignon. To secure his acceptance of their marriage and support against the accusations of Andrew's murder, Joanna sold him the city.\n\nThe Black Death forced the Hungarians to retreat from Naples in August 1348. Louis and Joanna, who had just had their elder daughter, Catherine, immediately returned to the kingdom. From early 1349 onwards, all documents for the kingdom were issued in the names of both husband and wife, and Louis was indisputably in control of military fortresses. On coins issued during their joint reign, Louis' name always preceded Joanna's. Although he was not officially recognised by Clement as king and co-ruler until 1352, it is likely that Neapolitans considered him their monarch from the moment he started acting as such.Louis took advantage of the turmoil caused by yet another Hungarian attack to wrest complete royal authority from his wife. He purged the court of her supporters, and struck down her favourite, Enrico Caracciolo, whom he accused of adultery in April 1349 and very likely had executed.\n\n\n=== Official reign ===\n\nIn 1350, the King of Hungary launched another invasion, forcing Louis and Joanna to flee to Gaeta. Louis narrowly defeated Hungarian forces with Pope Clement's help. The Pope, however, reprimanded Louis for \"treating the Queen as a prisoner and servant\", and agreed to recognise Louis as king and co-ruler only on the condition that he accepted the fact that he held the crown in Joanna's right. Their younger daughter, Frances, was born soon thereafter. Louis received Clement's formal recognition as his wife's co-ruler in all her realms on 20 or 23 March 1352, and was crowned king alongside her on Pentecost on 25 or 27 May 1352. Frances, by then the couple's only surviving child, died on their coronation day; Joanna never conceived again. Louis founded the Order of the Knot on the occasion of the coronation, most likely hoping to enhance the tarnished reputation he shared with Joanna. In 1356, they were crowned in Messina as rulers of Sicily, but failed to capture the entire island, which had been seized from the House of Anjou by the House of Barcelona in 1285 and thereafter ruled as a separate kingdom.The death of their supporter, Clement VI, was a blow to Louis and Joanna. His successor, Innocent VI, excommunicated them for failing to pay their annual tribute to the Holy See. The issue was resolved by a visit to Avignon in 1360.Louis' attempt in 1360 to dethrone Frederick the Simple and regain Sicily ended in a failure, though he did manage to occupy much of the island (including Palermo, the capital) before its barons rebelled. At home, he faced opposition from his and his wife's cousins, the House of Anjou-Durazzo, who strongly resented his dominance, with Louis of Gravina stirring revolts in Apulia.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nLouis died, probably of bubonic plague, in Naples on 26 May 1362. Joanna immediately resumed authority in her realms. Although she remarried twice more, to James IV of Majorca and Otto of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, Louis remained the only husband of hers whom she accorded status of co-monarch. Taranto passed to his younger brother, Philip II. Upon Louis' death, the order he had created simply dissolved. He was buried in the Territorial Abbey of Montevergine, next to his mother.Though a chronicler wrote that the \"death of Louis of Taranto caused great corruption in all the kingdom\", his contemporaries unanimously thought him to be lacking in both ability and character. Petrarch, familiar with the members of the Neapolitan court, described him as \"violent and mendacious, prodigal and avaricious, debauched and cruel\", a person who \"knew neither how to make his subjects love him\" and who even had no \"need of their love\". Louis I's greatest achievement was appointing Niccol\u00f2 Acciaioli as grand seneschal, which provided Naples with a capable administrator and military leader.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nJure uxoris, principle by which a man owns the property of his wife\nJames II, Count of La Marche, husband of Joanna II of Naples who tried to usurp her authority\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGiornale araldico-genealogico-diplomatico dell'Accademia araldica italiana. 4.

          "After taking the bus to Villeneuve and getting off right opposite the tourist office, I walked up the hill to the Fort. I have to add, how wonderful and helpful the staff are in French tourist offices, dishing out free maps and marking your route. There were two ticket offices.",

          "We picked a day to visit during the Mistral so it was quite windy as it is located on the hill behind the village next to the Fort. The gardens are quite varied and even have two ruined churches, a cemetery and a small chapel. The views from the gardens are wonderful.",

          "Some people in our tour visited these gardens and reported that they were not very interesting. Well they must be blind because they are an absolute delight. The views across the Rhone to central Avignon are absolutely stunning and, by themselves, are worth the entrance fee",

          "I hadn't thought a stroll through gardens would have had so many delights: the best view across to Avignon; shady gardens; ecclesiastical ruins - and a little informal cafe to boot! I should have planned better and taken longer over this refreshingly calm space. Just remember",

          "Lovely gardens around a 10th century abbey and worth a visit in their own right, however, it would be a shame to come up to see Fort Saint-Andre and bypass this. After all, you have already made the climb why not add an extra thing if you have time? Only two other people when",

          "We visited the gardens after our trip through the Fort. Somehow was had been under the impression the gardens had closed for the day when we arrived at the Fort and only realized they were not a half an hour before the real closing time. Still, we decided it was worth the cost",
          "The garden is well set out and the design has enough idiosyncrasies and nooks to make it interesting and worthwhile. As we visited it in Autumn, we do not believe that we got the best out of the garden as the flowers were largely absent. If the flower colours were out, I think",
          "We visited the garden on a warm September afternoon and were appreciative of the Mistral breezes through the garden. Best time to visit this garden I would imagine would be spring or early summer as not much is in flower at this time of year. I could visualise the iris flowers",

          "Definitely visit the Abby gardens. There's a lot to see and the views are incredible. It's a great place for a walk or lunch as well. You'll have to pack your lunch, but there are many places you can find to sit and enjoy. Plus it offers wonderful views of Avignon's center.",
          "Got in these gardens by pure coincidence and mistake... we were supposed to get in the other discreet gate for Fort Saint Andre, but this was shut (not locked) and instead the Abbey's door was wide open so we just got in, beleiving this was the attraction in itself. The gardens",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

        "wiki": "The Louvre (English:  LOOV(-r\u0259)), or the Louvre Museum (French: Mus\u00e9e du Louvre [myze dy luv\u0281] (listen)), is the world's  largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters (782,910 square feet). In 2019, the Louvre received 9.6 million visitors, making it the most visited museum in the world.The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built as the Louvre castle in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Acad\u00e9mie remained at the Louvre for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.\nThe museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on, but after Napoleon's abdication, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 12th\u201320th centuries ===\n\n\n==== Medieval, Renaissance, and Bourbon palace ====\n\nThe Louvre Palace, which houses the museum, was begun as a fortress by Philip II in the 12th century to protect the city from English soldiers which were in Normandy. Remnants of this castle are still visible in the crypt. Whether this was the first building on that spot is not known; it is possible that Philip modified an existing tower. According to the authoritative Grand Larousse encyclop\u00e9dique, the name derives from an association with wolf hunting den (via Latin: lupus, lower Empire: lupara). In the 7th century, St. Fare, an abbess in Meaux, left part of her \"Villa called Luvra situated in the region of Paris\" to a monastery, this territory probably did not correspond exactly to the modern site, however.\nThe Louvre Palace was altered frequently throughout the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, Charles V converted the building into a residence and in 1546, Francis I renovated the site in French Renaissance style. Francis acquired what would become the nucleus of the Louvre's holdings, his acquisitions including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. After Louis XIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, constructions slowed; however, the move permitted the Louvre to be used as a residence for artists, under Royal patronage. Four generations of Boulle were granted Royal patronage and resided in the Louvre in the following order: Pierre Boulle, Jean Boulle, Andre-Charles Boulle and his four sons (Jean-Philippe, Pierre-Beno\u00eet (c. 1683\u20131741), Charles-Andr\u00e9 (1685\u20131749) and Charles-Joseph (1688\u20131754)), after him. Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle (1642\u20131732) is the most famous French cabinetmaker and the preeminent artist in the field of marquetry, also known as \"Inlay\".  Boulle was \"the most remarkable of all French cabinetmakers\". He was commended to Louis XIV of France, the \"Sun King\", by Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619\u20131683) as being \"the most skilled craftsman in his profession\".  Before the fire of 1720 destroyed them, Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle held priceless works of art in the Louvre, including forty-eight drawings by Raphael'.\nBy the mid-18th century there were an increasing number of proposals to create a public gallery, with the art critic La Font de Saint-Yenne publishing, in 1747, a call for a display of the royal collection. On 14 October 1750, Louis XV agreed and sanctioned a display of 96 pieces from the royal collection, mounted in the Galerie royale de peinture of the Luxembourg Palace. A hall was opened by Le Normant de Tournehem and the Marquis de Marigny for public viewing of the Tableaux du Roy on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and contained Andrea del Sarto's Charity and works by Raphael; Titian; Veronese; Rembrandt; Poussin or Van Dyck, until its closing in 1780 as a result of the gift of the palace to the Count of Provence (the future king, Louis XVIII) by the king in 1778. Under Louis XVI, the royal museum idea became policy. The comte d'Angiviller broadened the collection and in 1776 proposed conversion of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre \u2013 which contained maps \u2013 into the \"French Museum\". Many proposals were offered for the Louvre's renovation into a museum; however, none was agreed on. Hence the museum remained incomplete until the French Revolution.\n\n\n==== French Revolution ====\nDuring the French Revolution the Louvre was transformed into a public museum. In May 1791, the Assembly declared that the Louvre would be \"a place for bringing together monuments of all the sciences and arts\". On 10 August 1792, Louis XVI was imprisoned and the royal collection in the Louvre became national property. Because of fear of vandalism or theft, on 19 August, the National Assembly pronounced the museum's preparation as urgent. In October, a committee to \"preserve the national memory\" began assembling the collection for display.\n\n\n===== Opening =====\n\nThe museum opened on 10 August 1793, the first anniversary of the monarchy's demise. The public was given free accessibility on three days per week, which was \"perceived as a major accomplishment and was generally appreciated\". The collection showcased 537 paintings and 184 objects of art. Three quarters were derived from the royal collections, the remainder from confiscated \u00e9migr\u00e9s and Church property (biens nationaux). To expand and organize the collection, the Republic dedicated 100,000 livres per year. In 1794, France's revolutionary armies began bringing pieces from Northern Europe, augmented after the Treaty of Tolentino (1797) by works from the Vatican, such as Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons and the Apollo Belvedere, to establish the Louvre as a museum and as a \"sign of popular sovereignty\".The early days were hectic; privileged artists continued to live in residence, and the unlabelled paintings hung \"frame to frame from floor to ceiling\". The structure itself closed in May 1796 due to structural deficiencies. It reopened on 14 July 1801, arranged chronologically and with new lighting and columns.\n\n\n==== Napoleon ====\nUnder Napoleon I, a northern wing paralleling the Grande Galerie was begun, and the collection grew through successful military campaigns. Following the Egyptian campaign of 1798\u20131801, Napol\u00e9on appointed the museum's first director, Dominique Vivant Denon. In tribute, the museum was renamed the \"Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on\" in 1803, and acquisitions were made of Spanish, Austrian, Dutch, and Italian works, either as spoils or through treaties such as the Treaty of Tolentino. At the end of Napoleon's First Italian Campaign in 1797, the Treaty of Campo Formio was signed with Count Philipp von Cobenzl of the Austrian Monarchy. This treaty not only marked the completion of Napoleon's conquest of Italy, but also the end of the first phases of the French Revolutionary Wars. Under this treaty, Italian cities were required to contribute pieces of art and patrimony to take part in Napoleon's \"parades of booty\" through Paris before being put into the Louvre Museum. One of the most famous pieces taken under this program was the Horses of Saint Mark. The four antique bronze horses, which had adorned the basilica of San Marco in Venice after the sack of Constantinople in 1204, were brought to Paris to reside atop Napoleon's Arc du Carrousel in Paris in 1797.Several churches and palaces, including Saint Mark's Basilica, were looted by the French, which outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities. In 1797, the Treaty of Tolentino was signed by Napoleon, and two statues, the Nile and Tiber, were taken to Paris. These statues had previously been in the Vatican, and both were housed in the Louvre until 1815. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Nile was returned to Italy. However, the Tiber remained in the Louvre Museum and can be seen in the collections today.\nThe Italian Peninsula was not the only region from which Napoleon took art. Under the Directory government of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist effort on the part of the government, but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.Dominique Vivant Denon was Napoleon's art advisor, and accompanied him on the expedition to Egypt. Through his initiative, the Valley of the Kings in Egypt was discovered and studied extensively. As a result, he was later installed by Napoleon as the director of Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on, formerly the Louvre, cementing the status of the museum as a center for global patrimony and storehouse for cultural heritage.One of the most important discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the Rosetta Stone. It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum. It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801. It is now on display at the British Museum.After the French defeat at Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works in their private collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many pieces were returned, even some that had been restored by the Louvre. In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.\n\n\n==== Restoration and Second Empire ====\n\nDuring the Restoration (1814\u20131830), Louis XVIII and Charles X between them added 135 pieces at a cost of 720,000 francs and created the department of Egyptian antiquities curated by Champollion, increased by more than 7,000 works with the acquisition of antiquities in the Edme-Antoine Durand, the Egyptian collection of Henry Salt or the second collection former by Bernardino Drovetti. This was less than the amount given for rehabilitation of Versailles, and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris. After the creation of the French Second Republic in 1848, the new government allocated two million francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the Galerie d'Apollon, the Salon Carr\u00e9, and the Grande Gal\u00e9rie. In 1861, Napoleon III bought 11,835 artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the Campana collection. Between  1852 and 1870, under Napoleon III, the museum added 20,000 new pieces to its collections, and the Pavillon de Flore and the Grande Gal\u00e9rie were remodelled under architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel.\n\n\n==== Damage during the 1871 Paris Commune ====\nThe Louvre was damaged during the suppression of the Paris Commune.  On 23 May 1871, as the French Army advanced into Paris, a force of Communards led by Jules Bergeret set fire to the adjoining Tuileries Palace. The fire burned for forty-eight hours, entirely destroying the interior of the palace and spreading to the museum next to it.  The library of the museum and some of the adjoining halls were destroyed, but the museum was saved by the efforts of Paris firemen and museum employees.\n\n\n==== Third Republic and World Wars ====\n\nDuring the Third Republic (1870\u20131940) the Louvre acquired new pieces mainly via donations and gifts. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis du Louvre (established in 1897) donated the Piet\u00e0 of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea. This piece, though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884. The 583-item Collection La Caze donated in 1869, included works by Chardin; Fragonard; Rembrandt \u2013 such as Bathsheba at Her Bath \u2013 and Gilles by Watteau.Museum expansion slowed after World War I, and the collection did not acquire many significant new works; exceptions were Georges de La Tour's Saint Thomas and Baron Edmond de Rothschild's (1845\u20131934) 1935 donation of 4,000 prints, 3,000 drawings, and 500 illustrated books.At the beginning of World War II the museum removed most of the art and hid valuable pieces. When Germany occupied the Sudetenland, many important artworks such as the Mona Lisa were temporarily moved to the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord. When war was formally declared a year later, most of the museum's paintings were sent there as well. Select sculptures such as Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo were sent to the Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay. On 27 August 1939, after two days of packing, truck convoys began to leave Paris. By 28 December, the museum was cleared of most works, except those that were too heavy and \"unimportant paintings [that] were left in the basement\". In early 1945, after the liberation of France, art began returning to the Louvre.\n\n\n==== Grand Louvre Pyramids ====\n\nBy 1874, the Louvre Palace had achieved its present form of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the Cour Carr\u00e9e (Square Court) and the oldest parts of the Louvre; and two wings which wrap the Cour Napol\u00e9on, the Richelieu Wing to the north and the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south. In 1983, French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand proposed, as one of his Grands Projets, the Grand Louvre plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid to stand over a new entrance in the main court, the Cour Napol\u00e9on. The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988 and the Louvre Pyramid was completed in 1989. The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan, the Pyramide Invers\u00e9e (Inverted Pyramid), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e du Louvre contains more than 380,000 objects and displays 35,000 works of art in eight curatorial departments with more than 60,600 square metres (652,000 sq ft) dedicated to the permanent collection. The Louvre exhibits sculptures, objets d'art, paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. It is the world's most visited museum, averaging 15,000 visitors per day, 65 percent of whom are foreign tourists.After architects Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti had won an international competition to create its new galleries for Islamic art, the new 3,000 sq m pavilion eventually opened in 2012, consisting of ground- and lower-ground-level interior spaces topped by a golden, undulating roof (fashioned from almost 9,000 steel tubes that form an interior web) that seems to float within the neo-Classical Visconti Courtyard in the middle of the Louvre's south wing. The galleries, which the museum had initially hoped to open by 2009, represent the first major architectural intervention at the Louvre since the addition of I.M. Pei's glass pyramid in 1989.On 5 February 2015, about one hundred archaeologists, protesting against commercial private involvement to protect France's heritage, blocked Louvre's ticket desks to facilitate free access to the museum. At least one announcement reading \"Free entrance offered by the archeologists\" has been attached to the ticket desk and a number of people visited the museum free of charge.\n\nThe Louvre is owned by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been required to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75 percent of the total budget to 62 percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about \u20ac122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest \u2013 new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions \u2013 is up to the museum to finance. A further \u20ac3 million to \u20ac5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5 million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180 million of the Louvre's yearly $350 million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.The Louvre employs a staff of 2,000 led by Director Jean-Luc Martinez, who reports to the French Ministry of Culture and Communications. Martinez replaced Henri Loyrette in April 2013. Under Loyrette, who replaced Pierre Rosenberg in 2001, the Louvre has undergone policy changes that allow it to lend and borrow more works than before. In 2006, it loaned 1,300 works, which enabled it to borrow more foreign works. From 2006 to 2009, the Louvre lent artwork to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, and received a $6.9 million payment to be used for renovations.In 2012, the Louvre and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco announced a five-year collaboration on exhibitions, publications, art conservation and educational programming. The \u20ac98.5 million expansion of the Islamic Art galleries in 2012 received state funding of \u20ac31 million, as well as \u20ac17 million from the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation founded by the eponymous Saudi prince. The republic of Azerbaijan, the Emir of Kuwait, the Sultan of Oman and King Mohammed VI of Morocco donated in total \u20ac26 million. In addition, the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi is supposed to provide \u20ac400 million over the course of 30 years for its use of the museum's brand. Loyrette has tried to improve weak parts of the collection through income generated from loans of art and by guaranteeing that \"20% of admissions receipts will be taken annually for acquisitions\". He has more administrative independence for the museum and achieved 90 percent of galleries to be open daily, as opposed to 80 percent previously. He oversaw the creation of extended hours and free admission on Friday nights and an increase in the acquisition budget to $36 million from $4.5 million.On the 500th anniversary of Leonardo Da Vinci's death, the Louvre held the largest ever single exhibit of his work, from 24 October  2019 to 24 February  2020. The event included over a hundred items: paintings, drawings and notebooks. A full 11 of the fewer than 20 paintings that Da Vinci completed in his lifetime were displayed. Five of them are owned by the Louvre, but the Mona Lisa was not included because it is in such great demand among visitors to the Louvre museum; the work remained on display in its gallery. Salvator Mundi was also not included since the Saudi owner did not agree to move the work from its hiding place. Vitruvian Man, however, was on display, after a successful legal battle with its owner, the Galleria dell'Accademia in Venice.\n\n\n==== Satellite museums ====\n\n\n===== Lens =====\n\nIn 2004, French officials decided to build a satellite museum on the site of an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of the new building, the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects SANAA were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that the new building, capable of receiving about 600 works of art, would attract up to 500,000 visitors a year when it opened in 2012.\n\n\n===== Abu Dhabi =====\n\nOn 8 November 2017, a direct extension of the Louvre, Louvre Abu Dhabi, opened its doors to the public in the city of Abu Dhabi. A 30-year agreement, signed by French Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Sheik Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, established the museum on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi in exchange for \u20ac832,000,000 (US$1.3 billion). The Louvre Abu Dhabi, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel and the engineering firm of Buro Happold, occupy 24,000 square metres (260,000 sq ft) and is covered by an iconic metallic roof designed to cast rays of light mimicking sunlight passing through date palm fronds in an oasis. France agreed to rotate between 200 and 300 artworks during a 10-year period; to provide management expertise; and to provide four temporary exhibitions a year for 15 years. The art will come from multiple museums, including the Louvre, the Georges Pompidou Centre, the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Versailles, the Mus\u00e9e Guimet, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, and the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly.\n\n\n===== Iran =====\nIn March 2018 an exhibition of dozens of artworks and relics belonging to France's Louvre Museum was opened to visitors in Tehran, as a result of an agreement between Iranian and French presidents in 2016. In the Louvre, two departments were allocated to the antiquities of the Iranian civilization, and the managers of the two departments visited Tehran. Relics belonging to Ancient Egypt, Rome and Mesopotamia as well as French royal items were showcased at the Tehran exhibition.\nIran's National Museum building was designed and constructed by French architect Andr\u00e9 Godard. Following its time in Tehran, the exhibition is set to be held in the Khorasan Grand Museum in Mashhad, northeastern Iran in June 2018.\n\n\n==== Conservation ====\nIn 2009, Minister of Culture Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand approved a plan that would have created a storage facility 30 km (19 mi) northwest of Paris to hold objects from the Louvre and two other national museums in Paris's flood zone, the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay; the plan was later scrapped. In 2013, his successor Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti announced that the Louvre would move more than 250,000 works of art held in a 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft) basement storage area in Li\u00e9vin; the cost of the project, estimated at \u20ac60 million, will be split between the region (49%) and the Louvre (51%). The Louvre will be the sole owner and manager of the store. In July 2015, a team led by British firm Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners was selected to design the complex, which will have light-filled work spaces under one vast, green roof.\n\n\n=== Controversial acquisitions ===\nThe Louvre is involved in controversies that surround cultural property seized under Napoleon I, as well as during World War II by the Nazis. During Nazi occupation, thousands of artworks were stolen. But after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and were assigned to the Louvre's Office des Biens Priv\u00e9s. In 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Mus\u00e9es de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Mus\u00e9es Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.\nThey were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950\u20131954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947\u20131949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 initiated the Matt\u00e9oli Commission, headed by Jean Matt\u00e9oli, to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678 pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners. During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.\nAccording to Serge Klarsfeld, since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of prescription acquisitive of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.\nNapoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the British Museum. On the other hand, the Dendera zodiac is, like the Rosetta Stone, claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via UNESCO's Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin. The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30 cm x 15 cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of d\u00e9classement from French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des mus\u00e9es de France.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Mus\u00e9e du Louvre contains about 460,000 objects and displays 35,000 works of art in eight curatorial departments.\n\n\n=== Egyptian antiquities ===\n\nThe department, comprising over 50,000 pieces, includes artifacts from the Nile civilizations which date from 4,000 BC to the 4th century AD. The collection, among the world's largest, overviews Egyptian life spanning Ancient Egypt, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, Coptic art, and the Roman, Ptolemaic, and Byzantine periods.\n\nThe department's origins lie in the royal collection, but it was augmented by Napoleon's 1798 expeditionary trip with Dominique Vivant, the future director of the Louvre. After Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone, Charles X decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, formed by Edm\u00e9-Antoine Durand, Henry Salt and Bernardino Drovet; these additions added 7,000 works. Growth continued via acquisitions by Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Mariette, after excavations at Memphis, sent back crates of archaeological finds including The Seated Scribe.Guarded by the Large Sphinx (c. 2000 BC), the collection is housed in more than 20 rooms. Holdings include art, papyrus scrolls, mummies, tools, clothing, jewelry, games, musical instruments, and weapons. Pieces from the ancient period include the Gebel el-Arak Knife from 3400 BC, The Seated Scribe, and the Head of King Djedefre. Middle Kingdom art, \"known for its gold work and statues\", moved from realism to idealization; this is exemplified by the schist statue of Amenemhatankh and the wooden Offering Bearer. The New Kingdom and Coptic Egyptian sections are deep, but the statue of the goddess Nephthys and the limestone depiction of the goddess Hathor demonstrate New Kingdom sentiment and wealth.\n\n\n=== Near Eastern antiquities ===\n\nNear Eastern antiquities, the second newest department, dates from 1881 and presents an overview of early Near Eastern civilization and \"first settlements\", before the arrival of Islam. The department is divided into three geographic areas: the Levant, Mesopotamia (Iraq), and Persia (Iran). The collection's development corresponds to archaeological work such as Paul-\u00c9mile Botta's 1843 expedition to Khorsabad and the discovery of Sargon II's palace. These finds formed the basis of the Assyrian museum, the precursor to today's department.The museum contains exhibits from Sumer and the city of Akkad, with monuments such as the Prince of Lagash's Stele of the Vultures from 2450 BC and the stele erected by Naram-Sin, King of Akkad, to celebrate a victory over barbarians in the Zagros Mountains. The 2.25-metre (7.38 ft) Code of Hammurabi, discovered in 1901, displays Babylonian Laws prominently, so that no man could plead their ignorance. The 18th-century BC mural of the Investiture of Zimrilim and the 25th-century BC Statue of Ebih-Il found in the ancient city-state of Mari are also on display at the museum.\nThe Persian portion of Louvre contains work from the archaic period, like the Funerary Head and the Persian Archers of Darius I. This section also contains rare objects from Persepolis which were also lent to the British Museum for its Ancient Persia exhibition in 2005.\n\n\n=== Greek, Etruscan, and Roman ===\n\nThe Greek, Etruscan, and Roman department displays pieces from the Mediterranean Basin dating from the Neolithic to the 6th century. The collection spans from the Cycladic period to the decline of the Roman Empire. This department is one of the museum's oldest; it began with appropriated royal art, some of which was acquired under Francis I. Initially, the collection focused on marble sculptures, such as the Venus de Milo. Works such as the Apollo Belvedere arrived during the Napoleonic Wars, but these pieces were returned after Napoleon I's fall in 1815. In the 19th century, the Louvre acquired works including vases from the Durand collection, bronzes such as the Borghese Vase from the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale.The archaic is demonstrated by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, c. 570\u2013560 BC. After the 4th century BC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190 BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding collection of more than one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.\n\n\n=== Islamic art ===\n\nThe Islamic art collection, the museum's newest, spans \"thirteen centuries and three continents\". These exhibits, comprising ceramics, glass, metalware, wood, ivory, carpet, textiles, and miniatures, include more than 5,000 works and 1,000 shards. Originally part of the decorative arts department, the holdings became separate in 2003. Among the works are the Pyxide d'al-Mughira, a 10th century ivory box from Andalusia; the Baptistery of Saint-Louis, an engraved brass basin from the 13th or 14th century Mamluk period; and the 10th century Shroud of Saint-Josse from Iran. The collection contains three pages of the Shahnameh, an epic book of poems by Ferdowsi in Persian, and a Syrian metalwork named the Barberini Vase. In September 2019, a new and improved Islamic art department was opened by Princess Lamia bint Majed Al-Saud. The new department exhibits 3,000 pieces were collected from Spain to India via the Arabian peninsula dating from the 7th to the 19th centuries.\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\nThe sculpture department comprises work created before 1850 that does not belong in the Etruscan, Greek, and Roman department. The Louvre has been a repository of sculpted material since its time as a palace; however, only ancient architecture was displayed until 1824, except for Michelangelo's Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave. Initially the collection included only 100 pieces, the rest of the royal sculpture collection being at Versailles. It remained small until 1847, when L\u00e9on Laborde was given control of the department. Laborde developed the medieval section and purchased the first such statues and sculptures in the collection, King Childebert and stanga door, respectively. The collection was part of the Department of Antiquities but was given autonomy in 1871 under Louis Courajod, a director who organized a wider representation of French works. In 1986, all post-1850 works were relocated to the new Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. The Grand Louvre project separated the department into two exhibition spaces; the French collection is displayed in the Richelieu wing, and foreign works in the Denon wing.The collection's overview of French sculpture contains Romanesque works such as the 11th-century Daniel in the Lions' Den and the 12th-century Virgin of Auvergne. In the 16th century, Renaissance influence caused French sculpture to become more restrained, as seen in Jean Goujon's bas-reliefs, and Germain Pilon's Descent from the Cross and Resurrection of Christ. The 17th and 18th centuries are represented by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's 1640\u20131 Bust of Cardinal Richelieu, \u00c9tienne Maurice Falconet's Woman Bathing and Amour mena\u00e7ant, and Fran\u00e7ois Anguier's obelisks. Neoclassical works includes Antonio Canova's Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss (1787). The 18th and 19th centuries are represented by the French sculptor Alfred Barye.\n\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n\nThe Objets d'art collection spans the time from the Middle Ages to the mid-19th century. The department began as a subset of the sculpture department, based on royal property and the transfer of work from the Basilique Saint-Denis, the burial ground of French monarchs that held the Coronation Sword of the Kings of France. Among the budding collection's most prized works were pietre dure vases and bronzes. The Durand collection's 1825 acquisition added \"ceramics, enamels, and stained glass\", and 800 pieces were given by Pierre R\u00e9voil. The onset of Romanticism rekindled interest in Renaissance and Medieval artwork, and the Sauvageot donation expanded the department with 1,500 middle-age and fa\u00efence works. In 1862, the Campana collection added gold jewelry and maiolicas, mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries.The works are displayed on the Richelieu Wing's first floor and in the Apollo Gallery, named by the painter Charles Le Brun, who was commissioned by Louis XIV (the Sun King) to decorate the space in a solar theme. The medieval collection contains the coronation crown of Louis XIV, Charles V's sceptre, and the 12th century porphyry vase. The Renaissance art holdings include Giambologna's bronze Nessus and Deianira and the tapestry Maximillian's Hunt. From later periods, highlights include Madame de Pompadour's S\u00e8vres vase collection and Napoleon III's apartments.In September 2000, the Louvre Museum dedicated the Gilbert Chagoury and Rose-Marie Chagoury Gallery to display tapestries donated by the Chagourys, including a 16th-century six-part tapestry suite, sewn with gold and silver threads representing sea divinities, which was commissioned in Paris for Colbert de Seignelay, Secretary of State for the Navy.\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nThe painting collection has more than 7,500 works from the 13th century to 1848 and is managed by 12 curators who oversee the collection's display. Nearly two-thirds are by French artists, and more than 1,200 are Northern European. The Italian paintings compose most of the remnants of Francis I and Louis XIV's collections, others are unreturned artwork from the Napoleon era, and some were bought. The collection began with Francis, who acquired works from Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo and brought Leonardo da Vinci to his court. After the French Revolution, the Royal Collection formed the nucleus of the Louvre. When the d'Orsay train station was converted into the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in 1986, the collection was split, and pieces completed after the 1848 Revolution were moved to the new museum. French and Northern European works are in the Richelieu wing and Cour Carr\u00e9e; Spanish and Italian paintings are on the first floor of the Denon wing.Exemplifying the French School are the early Avignon Piet\u00e0 of Enguerrand Quarton; the anonymous painting of King Jean le Bon (c. 1360), possibly the oldest independent portrait in Western painting to survive from the postclassical era; Hyacinthe Rigaud's Louis XIV; Jacques-Louis David's The Coronation of Napoleon; Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's The Raft of the Medusa; and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People. Nicolas Poussin, the Le Nain brothers, Philippe de Champaigne, Le Brun, La Tour, Watteau, Fragonard, Ingres, Corot, and Delacroix are well represented.Northern European works include Johannes Vermeer's The Lacemaker and The Astronomer; Caspar David Friedrich's The Tree of Crows; Rembrandt's The Supper at Emmaus, Bathsheba at Her Bath, and The Slaughtered Ox.\nThe Italian holdings are notable, particularly the Renaissance collection. The works include Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini's Calvarys, which reflect realism and detail \"meant to depict the significant events of a greater spiritual world\". The High Renaissance collection includes Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Virgin and Child with St. Anne, St. John the Baptist, and Madonna of the Rocks. Caravaggio is represented by The Fortune Teller and Death of the Virgin. From 16th century Venice, the Louvre displays Titian's Le Concert Champetre, The Entombment and The Crowning with Thorns.\n\nThe La Caze Collection, a bequest to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in 1869 by Louis La Caze, was the largest contribution of a person in the history of the Louvre. La Caze gave 584 paintings of his personal collection to the museum. The bequest included Antoine Watteau's Commedia dell'arte player of Pierrot (\"Gilles\"). In 2007, this bequest was the topic of the exhibition \"1869: Watteau, Chardin... entrent au Louvre. La collection La Caze\".Some of the best known paintings of the museum have been digitized by the French Center for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France.\n\n\n=== Prints and drawings ===\nThe prints and drawings department encompasses works on paper. The origins of the collection were the 8,600 works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200 works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415 pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000 royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000 prints, 3,000 drawings, and 5,000 illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to the fragility of the paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.\n\n\n== Location, access, and facilities ==\n\nThe museum lies in the center of Paris on the Right Bank, in the 1st arrondissement. It was home to the former Tuileries Palace, which closed off the western end of the Louvre entrance courtyard, but was heavily damaged by fire during the Paris Commune of 1871 and later demolished. The adjacent Tuileries Gardens, created in 1564 by Catherine de' Medici, was designed in 1664 by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre. The gardens house the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, a contemporary art exhibition space which was used to store confiscated Jewish cultural property during the 1940 to 1944 German occupation of France. Parallel to the Jeu de Paume is the Orangerie, home to the famous Water Lilies paintings by Claude Monet.\nThe Louvre is slightly askew of the Historic Axis (Axe historique), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins on the east in the Louvre courtyard and runs west along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of the Axe despite past appearances to the contrary. The Louvre can be reached by the Palais Royal \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre M\u00e9tro or the Louvre-Rivoli stations.The Louvre has three entrances: the main entrance at the pyramid, an entrance from the Carrousel du Louvre underground shopping mall, and an entrance at the Porte des Lions (near the western end of the Denon wing).\nUnder the main entrance to the museum is the Carrousel du Louvre, a shopping mall operated by Unibail-Rodamco. Among other stores, it has the first Apple Store in France, and a McDonald's restaurant, the presence of which has created controversy.The use of cameras and video recorders is permitted inside, but flash photography is forbidden.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of most visited art museums\nList of museums in Paris\nCenter for Research and Restoration of Museums of France\nMus\u00e9e de la mode et du textile\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLouvre's 360x180 degree panorama virtual tour",

          "Great visit, we bought tickets for this along with the tickets for fort saint andre. 9 euros for both. Great to walk around and discover and a very nice, cheap coffee shop inside to stop for a rest at the end of the visit.",
          "We weren't really sure what to expect of the Chartreuse monastery. However, just walking into the Allee' des Muriers, made us immediately aware that we were entering an other worldly place. The monastery draws one in with it's gardens, frescoes, cloisters and courtyards as you",
          "Highly recommend the restaurant inside the monastery. It's charming; and the food is tasty and ginormous portions. The staff was friendly and helpful.",
          "We stopped in Villeneuve-lez-Avignon for a few hours and are glad we went to the Chartreuse. It's a little bit of an unexpected surprise. The site is gorgeous and peaceful. I've been to Avignon and Villeneuve a few times and overall, I actually prefer Villeneuve due to sites",
          "We literally wandered a while looking at the beautiful property (an old convent?)before finding our way to the restaurant ... The service was impeccable and the food and wine selection grea and excellentt. This is a hidden pearl",
          "Very interesting and impressive complex, very well preserved and restaured; don't miss it if you are around.",
          "From the street you do not expect the size, beauty or depth of this place where you can wander about on both levels. Incredible. Tip: Don't miss, and it's easy to do so, the brief movie on how they are creating a 3D virtual replica of the Pont d' Avignon. It is near the entrance",
          "We were unsure as to whether or not this place was an attraction as signage on wall outside was a little unclear and very little to encourage you to visit. However on entering and asking if it was open, a very friendly young lady on reception explained lots about the venue to",
          "This monastery near Avignon is so worth to visit. I didn't plan to go there but I am glad I did because you will see how the Carthusian monks once lived and they still do live in a few places around the world. You can see a monk's cell and a beautiful garden, and a few rooms",
          "The chartreuse is an ex-monastery. The buildings are well kept but the gardens have been allowed to run to seed, which is a great shame, it could all be very beautiful. Nevertheless, we found it a fine way to spend a couple of hours away from the crowds.",
          "This was a pleasant visit which showed a lovely monastic environment. It is a pretty area to walk around and is quite peaceful. The surrounding town is gorgeous so a great day out.",
          "Touted as the largest Chartreuse in France, this one is located just a few minutes outside Avignon, right next to the ominous Fort Saint-Andr\u00e9. One of the monks' cells has been restored so visitors get a sense of the daily life in the monastery. No prison-like cells here: this",
          "We purchased a 5 attraction ticket for 17 euros each to explore the enclave of Villeneuve. This entire town is understated and needs to showcase itself better. It is a short bus ride from the avignon center.",
          "This is one of four places to visit in Villanueva-les-Avignon. We restricted ourselves to the Abbey garden in the grounds of the fort and the chartreuse spending about 2 hours in each. There were very few tourists about as it seems the majority do not venture up from Avignon -",
          "I was thoroughly looking forward to this visit as they are very much my thing. It's a beautifully peaceful venue in a very nice setting & currently you can view excellent videos of the 3D reconstruction of the Pont St B\u00e9nezet (different to the ones shown at the bridge itself).",
          "Not only is Villeneuve itself a little gem ( easily reached by bus from Avignon) but the monastery is a stunner. Beautiful setting, loadsa history, friendly staff and while we were there great modern art installations ( well, some of them) too. Cafe was shut for summer but many",
          "Large well preserved monastery with fascinating series of large and small cloisters and courtyard gardens, some super frescoes and good interpretation. Allow a couple of hours. There\u2019s a nice small cafe and a posh restaurant on site. We liked this better than the famous Palais",
          "We enjoyed our time at Chartreuse. It only takes about 45minutes or so to walk through and explore. Many of the rooms had modern art installations. We are big modern art fans, but I applaud them for supporting the arts and I still loved the history, since this monastery is from",
          "A well-preserved but empty Carthusian house a short walk from the centre of Vikleneuve-les-Avignon, home now to a well-regarded restaurant (not tested) and also used from concerts etc. Visitors pay the fee and then wander round independently. There isn't much signage and few",
          "My husband and I went to Villeneuve-les-Avignon to see Fort Saint-Andre. We arrived too early. The fort was not open, so we went to La Chartreuse. (Please note, we traveled at the end of November; check opening and closing times before you go.) We spent over an hour wandering",
          "Fascinating window into medieval monastic life, well explained and laid out; beautiful building. When we were there, there was also an interesting set of modern short art films on biblical stories.",
          "This chartreuse, which is just a few km from the centre of Avignon, is nice and interesting but we would have liked to have more detailed explanations. There was an exhibit with many displays, videos etc.",
          "These remains (they're better than ruins) of a convent in the \"new\" part of Avignon were interesting and well presented. The cloisters are still used for resident artists but plenty of areas and building are open to the public.",
          "Fascinating visit. There are clear explanations but I would like more information about the social history. Access is easy from just off the town centre. There are some lovely quiet places to sit.",
          "Beautiful historical building. For some reason, our visit was free, but I think that there is usually a fee. Quite a large building.",
          "Although renovated it is done sympathetically. The kiosk could be more friendly, and luckily the paper guide does help get your bearings. Well worth a visit",
          "According to the Tourist Information Bureaux this is the principle attraction of Villeneuve lez Avignon, and its not difficult to see why, even though there are some other interesting sites in the same area, some of which are available with a combo ticket. Take your time to",
          "Spent a good two hours wandering the cloisters of this gorgeous building - we almost had the place to ourselves on a very warm spring afternoon. The kids (11 and 12) were given a quiz to do on a tablet which inspired them to look more closely at their surroundings which included",

          "If you've ever wondered what the different liturgical orders did in their cloisters, this is the place to visit. It is huge! Extensive! Large! You get the full feel of what it was like to be here. The impressive entry and gate really do take you to a place of contemplation",
          "We virtually had the place to ourselves. The monastery dates from 1352 when it was founded by Pope Innocent VI, and his tomb can be seen in one of the chapels. We found the most beautiful area to be the cloisters which are completely surrounded by monks cells. We thing that such",
          "This Abbey gives an insight into life in a bygone era. In combination with other sites in this area it adds to an enjoyable day walking around Villeneuve",

          "The scale of this monastery is surprising and throughout the very extensive site everything has been wonderfully preserved. The magnificent restored gates at the entrance to the monastery are worth the visit alone but the whole place provides a very good feel of monastic life",

          "This historic Abbey is in the area of the old town in Villeneuf les Avignon. Although it is no longer used for the production of Chartreuse it is definitely worth the visit. There is free parking although the access is via a very narrow street. As it is in the centre of the",

          "Surprised by the size given but given there are 3 inner cloisters perhaps one shouldn't. The monastery had a really good feel to it. The building is in excellent condition and offers the opportunity throughout the tour to sit in quiet and take a moment of reflection, something",

          "The Chartreuse is very sprawling with interesting nooks and crannies. There are a few restored rooms of monks that made us imagine what life would be like. You also had to wonder where the junior monks stayed. It was a welcome change from seeing ruined castles and over top",
          "The monastery with its cloisters and beautiful frescos in the chapel, is a fascinating place to visit. The gardens were peaceful and well-tended, with free entry the day we were there, as part of an open garden scheme across Provence. Even without much literature about the",

          "The place is lovely. It is huge. The visit is very interesting. I was just a bit disappointed by the poor information given. Few boards give very minimal explanation. I thought for a place like this with so much history I would be able to learn how, when, why.... But nothing ...",
          "This former monastery and its lovely cloisters was a delightful respite on hot summer afternoon, after the busy streets of old Avignon. It was nice to walk around the buildings, explore the rooms, see the old frescoes in the chapel, and the enjoy this nicely restored place.",
          "I can't believe the reviewers below are talking about the same place as me! 5.50eu is a lot to pay to come here. There is little to see, a half broken church, some lame gardens, many empty stone rooms. Some of the restoration work looks very obvious and does not work seem",

          "To see a Carthusian monastery from the inside is not something many of us will ever get to see. This (now deserted) medieval monastery is a revelation. One house (the monks lived in individual houses around courtyards or cloisers) has been restored to what it would have been",

          "The monastery is an amazing place and because it is still quite whole (unlike most UK monastic ruins) it is incredibly evocative of the way of life that was carried on there for hundreds of years. It was a solitary but quite comfortable life for the monks and would fascinate",

Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

          "It was good.\ud83d\ude00 very nice and relaxing ride a bit bumpy though. Still though it was amazing! Brakes needed oiling. They were screechy.",
          "We used this service on the last day. We wish we had done it at the beginning as it opened our eyes to so much. Very good audio description in English and other languages. Not to be missed!",
          "This was a fun way to get an overall view of the city because this little train could go through alleyways that a car or bus could not. This is not a hop on hop off type of ride. They also accepted credit cards for the ride. Good narrative with decent headphones.",
          "First 10 minutes was mildly interesting. After that 30 or so minutes moving through town. No stops for photos and barely time to look at barely interesting stuff. Save your money.",
          "A great trip with lots of interesting information available through headphones in a choice of languages. The train and its three carriages meandered all over the town to the main tourist points, sometimes through the narrowest of streets where you could reach out and touch walls",
          "The narration is really average, not enough explanation behind things but was only \u20ac9. Ride was fine and so are headphones",
          "What an enjoyable experience. I firstly hesitated taking it as the Hop on, Hop off Bus was most disappointing. Its 45mins around the streets, narrow ones in particular with an ideal view of the sites of note in Avignon with a most pleasent atmosphere. It was 9euro well spent,",
          "As this was our first visit to Avignon this small road train tour round the old town was a great way to get our bearings, learn some history and avoid some climbing. We used our experience to help decide what we wanted to see in more detail on foot. Can get very busy,",
          "Uncomfortable ride annoying a lot of pedestrians and caf\u00e9s. Unbelievable it is allowed that this train goes into such small streets. Look to the faces of the people on the street and you know what they think of tourists on these trains. Only basic explanation via audioguide like",
          "This train ride is a must do if visiting Avignon,you see some places that you would not see otherwise,and saves walking up the steep hill to the Popes house.",
          "We decided to catch this train. So glad we did. We are only here 1.5 days. It gave us a good idea what we would like to see in our limited time here. Narrow streets we superbly navigated. If you have the time I recommend you do it. Only one area to get on and off at so don\u2019t be",
          "great ride for a first intro to this ancient city of the French Popes. The commentaries are very helpful to understand the history and great ride if you only have a very short time to visit.",
          "This is a great way to get oriented to the town. The ride is less than an hour and takes you all around town and up to a vista for a great view. You wear a headset and choose your language.",
          "we took advantage of the little train to have a stroll on the narrow streets, as our daughter was very tired. good explanations, in more languages. we liked it.",
          "This is Avignon's equivalent of the open top bus. This gave us the opportunity to see the main city sites but because the train is quite small we were able to access some of the interesting small back streets.",
          "On a 37 degree day it\u2019s the best E$8 you will spend - they pick up outside the Palais Des Pope\u2019s and the trip lasts an hour - they have headphones to listen to in many different languages/ great way to get your arms around Avignon. Tip? Park in the oratoire parking lot - go down",
          "We were here when the temperature was 40c and we knew we would not be able to walk around the sights. The train was perfect and took us everywhere we needed to see. Staff were friendly and the driver made it all look very easy! We enjoyed it so much, we also did the train",
          "+Positives - very litte traffic inside the city walls so the train was able to get around pretty quickly. Friendly driver. Very informative on the history of Avignon. -Negatives - none",
          "This little tour has a good commentary, with an audio guide in a wide range of languages but, because French is spoken over the train's loud speaker you get an echo effect which is off putting. The train runs every 30 minutes- except when it doesn't. There was no train at 12.30",
          "I had sprained my back so walking was difficult. I wish I had listened to the other people who were getting the combination ticket. It\u2019s a great way to see the sights. Pick it up on the top of the square and sit inside. The guy comes around and takes your money. There\u2019s a",
          "We stumbled upon this train after hours of walking around. We were hot and tired and thought, Why not? The ride is about an hour with a recorded voice tour via head phones where you can choose from several languages. This little train pretty much has the right of way on these",
          "The Streets of Avignon were all made so many years ago only either one way traffic or no traffic, which makes it great for walking. To see the great things in the inside of the wall this is the way to go.",
          "Well worth a trip aroung back streets of Avignon to find places you would probably not visit. Would recommend taking 10.00 oclock train as ours was fairly empty bur later trains were pacted.",
          "To start off your time in Avignon, the Petit Train is the way to begin. You board in front of the Palais De Papes. It is only Euro 9 for getting to know what you want to then explore in depth later. It is 45 minutes passing almost all of the walled city. The speaker system is",
          "I personally like these trains and usually go on then if they available in a new town I am visiting. They give a quick tour of the area, showing different areas and its ideal to get your bearings when travelling around a new town. The guy selling the tickets was welsh and was",
          "Nice way to start our trip to Avignon. Enjoyed the commentary and learned a lot about the history of when the Popes were in Avignon.",
          "Only use this if you have mobility problems. This is an area which is a joy to walk around. Narrow streets are accessible by foot., and are worth the extra effort.",
          "If tired of walking, less able to walk or simply as an introduction to seeing the city of Avignon I\u2019d recommend the train. Caught outside the Palais costing 9 Euro for a 45 minutes tour it is excellent.",
          "Save your shoe leather! Ho on the little train, and enjoy the sights of Avignon and get a feeling of where you want to go back and explore. A delightful extra!",
          "This is small station with an old building while the TGV looks modern and ugly in comparison. Useful square with friendly shops and the bus stop is nearby too.",
          "We went on the Petit Train in October. It takes around 40 minutes to go around the whole town; pausing in areas to tell you about famous or historical attractions. I had a great time and now have learnt much more about the city of Avignon! Would recommend!",
          "As 2 of our group have mobility issues, this was the ideal way to travel all around Avignon. We saw all the wonderful sights and had excellent commentary through headsets. Such a beautiful city, I can't believe that I have never visited Avignon before.",
          "The train starts on the large square outside of the Palais des Papes and takes you around the old town of Avignon. I consider this tour a nice way to get acquainted with the old town. The provided headsets give you lots of interesting background information of the sites you",
          "I found this little train an unpleasant addition to the Avignon experience. I suppose if you are a traveler whose is unable to walk, this train might be necessary. Otherwise it seemed like a touch that did not add anything to the Avignon vibe.",
          "Train is v cute and my daughter loves it. To go through the streets and see avignon in a nutshell. Frequent enough services.",
          "Avignon is a rather large walled city. If you just visit the magnificent Pope\u2019s Palace, you will miss a lot. We had only one day in Avignon but the train was a big help to see the other things that we could not have done on our own with the time constraint. The city has a round",
          "If you are visiting Avignon taking the Petit Train is a must to view the town. You can then know where to visit later. The train takes you all through the narrow streets, up to the gardens and stops for a viewing of the Bridge. It costs four euros and we bought our tickets",
          "These trains aren't really my idea of fun as a rule but the friend I was with wanted to try it out. I have to say that it was better than expected. The commentary was via headphones with about ten different languages to choose from. It wasn't especially comfortable as we",
          "Great value for money. 8 euro for 45 mins of guided tour and done in many languages. Takes you around the narrow streets and major locations except the bridge, sorry pier. great fun and whole heartedly recommended",
          "Ideal to sit back and see the sights around Avignon.Great fun and enjoyable.Headset included so you can listen to info as you pass by places of importance.All for 9 Euros each.",

          "It\u2019s worth looking at \u2018Visite Avignon par Lieutaud\u2019 as the Little Train info is all listed by the Tourist Board. Little Train very educational, takes you around the old town, you\u2019ll see sites that you may not find on foot! Cost \u20ac9.00 per adult includes a headset to give you all",
          "We really wanted to get on this train. We'd see it and start running toward it but it would drive away. It was hard to find where to catch this train. We really wanted to do it.",
          "Wow this train got through some amazing small spaces allowing those on board to see everything the city has to offer. Reasonable price and good commentary",
          "We spent the morning exploring on foot but by mid afternoon our kids were tiring so we jumped on the Petit Train. The views from the top of the garden behind the Palais des Papes is spectacular - great view of the pont and river, plus the countryside. Audio guide was",
          "This is an excellent way to get an idea of the old city. From the views at the top of the Dom De la Roche to the narrow streets it gives you places you may want to explore further. I found it quite amazing that the train could navigate some of the very sharp bends. Well done to",
          "This thing trundles round the town, down some very narrow streets, and the audio-commentary is fairly good. \u20ac9 per person represents reasonable value. Recommended.",
          "We found this 45 minute tour worth while as you are shown all the sites and can then choose to come back and explore in detail. View from the park aboive the Pope's Palace was great.",
          "We took the 45min tour and were shown the important sites in Avignon with audio guide in many languages included.",
          "Cute little train to take you for a short sightseeing tour. Yesterday was over 36 degrees and so hot to walk. Couldn\u2019t get a seat! It was packed. Better luck next time.",
          "At \u20ac9 it was good value and fun. Amazing how the vehicle navigates some really narrow streets and lanes. Commentary was a little hard to hear and it is basic. Good to introduce you to Avignon and create interest in further exploration. The man selling tickets was fun too.",
          "This was a great way to see Avignon with the short time we had at our disposal. The chap selling the tickets was also very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend it.",
          "A thoroughly enjoyable ride with just the right level of commentary. We were amazed at some of the narrow passages travelled and able to identify some of the spots we would like to go back to. Have a feeling, seeing other people faces, that the ride appeals to the 'child' in us",
          "We spotted the little train in the main square and boarded, paid, it was super easy and the driver/ guides were friendly and helpful. We weren\u2019t expecting much but ended up loving it! We got to see the main sights of Avignon and had a really fun time. We had a toddler and it",
          "When the heat is high and one wants to visit the town, this special little train is quite incredible, going through the smallest street with great efficiency and taking one around with no problem of being lost or too tired",
          "A rather bumpy ride through tiny cobbled streets around the city that looked impossible for a car to navigate yet alone a 4 car coupled \"train\". Very good value and an ideal way to see the key areas and sites to explore in more detail on foot later.",
          "Amazing journey through the narrow streets of Avignon with fantastic commentary. A great train ride. Well worth the ticket price.",
          "One of the better tourist train rides I have been on. It goes all around Avignon, down some very narrow streets and gives you a very good idea of the layout of the city. Not cheap but it does last 45 minutes and probably worth it. In the summer it is nice to have a rest as",
          "After walking for days (in the summer heat), it was a treat to ride the little tour train up and down the medieval streets of Avignon.",
          "Except to get your bearings around Avignon, this is a pointless tour. Although thr driver taking you down some precariously narrow streets is interesting, the information given is minimal. Don't waste your \u20ac\u00a3$",
          "This trip is superb for an hours tour around the very narrow winding streets of the old Avignon especially if you are travelling with children or the elderly. Well worth the 9 euros each to get your bearings for further exploration on foot. Very relaxing trip and definitely",
          "Even small kids who love trains were bored by this. The first five minutes, up the hill and into the gardens and back down the hill were interesting, the rest was just time filler and an excuse to charge \u20ac9 per adult for 45 minutes. Only one of the four audio guide audio jacks",
          "Again a great way to see parts of Avignon that you may miss when walking. Another headset giving you information which you can set in your own language.",
          "The train is boarded outside the papal palace. 9 euros fir a 40 minute ride inside the walled city. On board there are headphones to hear the commentary in a variety of languages. It was a dead loss trying to listen to the English version as blaring out over it is the French",
          "We had a member of our group who injured his knee and could not walk much, so we took the petit train. It was a good way to see a lot of the old town in a short time. Then we walked back to the TI where we parked our car.",
          "We were in Avignon in May. There were (when we were there) two trains an hour & the trip lasts around 45 mins. They give you headphones to listen to the guided tour - there were plenty of languages. The train starts and ends right outside the Popes Palace. It takes you up the",
          "The Petite train was a very helpful guide after our arrival in Avignon. A pleasant ride that gave us an overview of the entire town with views of all important sights. Inexpensive.",
          "Used this train to see around Avignon the cost for two was 18 euros, the information being provided via headphones was behind the point where the train actually was situated at the time. However a quick trip to see around the town and to see where things are will help, try and",
          "The train visited everywhere interesting in the old town. Just being on the train was an experience as it made its way around the very narrow streets. The commentary was excellent. It is best to make notes of where you wish to return to take photos as the streets are so narrow I",
          "I can recommend this train. Within a reasonable time you go around the whole town, you sit comfortably, listen to the audio guide, take photos...we did enjoy it. And it is not that expensive either. It is parked right next to the Palace, you cannot miss it. I think it departs",
          "I bought a double pass for the train and the bus tour...train was best. I\u2019ve never seen a town so small with so many different tour companies for the historic centre. The train departs from outside the Palais du Papes. When I arrived at 3:28, the 3:30 had already left. There was",
          "We decided to take the Petit Train tour as a way to get an overview and some background for the pedestrian area in Avignon. It was a bit disorganised in that it wasn\u2019t clear where to buy tickets but at the last minute we were told that we could buy them on the train. The tour",
          "The train journey itself was relatively enjoyable, but two elements left a sour taste in the mouth, even despite the high price. Despite there only being one point to alight, there was zero organisation, despite the presence of an employee. No-one knew where to stand to wait for",
          "Wasn\u2019t planning to do this but it was just about to leave so thought, why not! It saved a lot of walking and I got to see as much as possible of lovely Avignon. At \u20ac9 not too bad as prices for attractions go, it perhaps could have stopped in one or two places for photo ops but",
          "We firmly believe that in any town the first 3 things you should do is go straight to the tourism office to see what you can do in the town. Check were the supermarket is & go on a tram, train or bus tour to get your bearings.",
          "Perfect way to look around Avignon very enjoyable and not too expensive it gives you a chance to look and get a idea of where to go back to",
          "This trip round the main sights of Avignon is an easy way of seeing the city. It starts at the square outside the Palace of the Popes and goes through narrow sidestreets, covering places which one might not otherwise visit. Best not to catch the last one of the day, as we got",
          "This is a good way to take a rest if your feet are tired but the rest of you is still alert! And let's face it, it brings out your inner child. Just be warned that at one point, it swings out onto what looks like a four-lane highway, which is initially slightly scary as you",
          "Great Train ride Fab views of Avignon for only 9 Euros. You get to see many parts of Avignon that we could not have discover in 2 days.",
          "We took the train ride around Avignon and found it pretty boring and superficial. In hindsight we would have been better to do the walking tour. Good for the mobility challenged.",
          "Arriving in Avignon we were walking near the Palace of the Papes, noticed the land train and decided to have a trip. It took us up into some gardens and we saw the views over the river and they slowed down for all to see the view and take photo's, we then went around various",
          "This was a interesting train trip and would of given it 5 stars but our headset stop working half way through. What we heard was interesting and informative. It also gave us a great ideas where we wanted to visit later. Do this train on the first day to find out the best places",
          "This is a great experience, winding through the narrowest of streets and listening to the commentary in your own language.",
          "This was the first thing we did upon arriving and we're so happy we did . We only had 3 days in Avignon and this little train gave us a nice orientation of the old city and we made notes along the way of things we wanted to come back to do. The best thing about the Avignon",
          "So glad I made our group take this train as we would not have walked to the areas it took us to. Headsets programmed for 10 languages enabled you to know where they were at and came on automatically so you didn't have to think about them. Many very interesting facts given and",
          "this is a very popular attraction that we picked up after a brief queue outside the palais de papes. it gave a good tour up hill and down dales and through some incredibly tiny streets in central Avignon and our along the river Rhone. good multi lingual commentary too",
          "My husband and I thought this trip around Avignon's old town in a little train might be a bit naff, but we were both pleasantly surprised. At 8 euros each and lasting 45 minutes, it was a great way to get an overview of Avignon and its history. Commentary is provided in several",
          "We had already been on a half day's walking tour and thought we had seen Avignon but the Petit Train took us to unexpected areas that were delightful. Sound commentaries were available in several languages but there is a lot of background noise to cope with as well. It was",
          "As far as tourist trains go, this one is smart and reasonably priced. It's worth pointing out however that, with a tourist nap of the city in hand, the old part of the city is so compact that it is easy to do it on foot; with the added advantage of being able to do it at your",
          "The petit train was very informative and it takes you all around the old city. Would highly recommend.",
          "Used this train from the cruise port to the Popes Palace for an evening show. Great way to save the legs for a walk into the Popes Palace Main hall for an evening show.The train is normally used for tourists during the day costs 8 Euros for a 45 minute trip along very narrow",
          "Do you really want that sort of false comfort vehicles sneak up in the streets? Will that wrong way of wandering, will that esthetically ugly invention, spread over all the tourists paths? Such an amusement is unworthy of real interested tourists.",
          "Good way to see Avignon \u2013 the train goes past all of the main attractions and is a nice way to spend 45 mins. Unfortunately, the audio guide broke half way through our tour. Still an enjoyable journey but essentially just riding through various streets unsure of what one is",
          "The petit train takes to around the town and has an audio to tell you the history behing all the monuments. It cost 2 euro and takes about 45 minutes. Well worth it.",
          "You get headphones that countless people use. Good to do if your feet are tired but I think walking around with a map would have been a better choice. 45 mins to a couple of main attractions about 7 euros It's ok but not number one on my list so if you have other things to",
          "Very good and relaxing tour of the city with photo stops for all the main points of interest. Be very careful to keep your personal stuff attended or held at all times. The train is a target for thieves who take advantage of the photo stops to pick up unattended items and leave",
          "Pleasant tour in, out, around the streets and parks of Avignon. Informative tour, interesting history.",
          "This is an excellent and informative way to see Avignon. The trip lasts about 45 minutes, which is longer than many such little trains.",
          "Lovely way to rest weary legs & learn some of the history of Avignon. Train somehow managed to navigate the very narrow streets so overall a very pleasant experience",
          "The tour went from 'tourist central' in Avignon, right outside the Palais des Papes, cost 8 euros, and we had a guided tour on headphones in various languages, discovered the main sites(Rocher des Doms, traced the course of the walls, the Pont d'Avignon) and some new little",
          "Good way to get familiar with the City & an informative commentary to give you an insight into the history",
          "A 45 minute trip through the narrow cobbled streets of Avignon was both interesting and enjoyable and something that would have been impossible on foot in the time available. Tickets cost 8\u20ac (5\u20ac for children). The trains run every 30 minutes and there was no wait. A",
          "When we got to Avignon we saw the train and thought it was a great option to do this with the kids but we headed first to visit the palace des papes, the bridge and we walked around the streets with shops and had lunch, after all that we were exhausted and the kids didn't want",
          "This 50 minute ride takes you through the cobbled streets, up to the castle and many other areas of the city so you can get an overview of how to spend your time. It can be a little bumpy and if you sit right at the back it does swing round the tight corners but this adds to",
          "We enjoyed our little train ride, which gave a good overview of the city and was quite good value for money.",
          "The train does get you up the road for a great view of Avignon and the area. Unfortunately it doesn't stop to get good photos. At least you get off your feet for a half hour, but not a must do.",
          "Having walked many kilometers we took this little train. It takes you all around the walled city and many of the interesting monuments. Good for those that having walking difficulties.",
          "Reasonably priced and around 50 minutes duration, it's a great way to see the city and decide what you want to then return to by foot to see in more detail. As a large family with teenagers and children we all loved it and enjoyed the recorded headphone commentary which is",
          "Avignon is very beautiful and ancient but there is a lot to see on a day trip so the train is a great way to get your bearing and sample the town before heading to the places you want to visit but really Avignon is all about walking and exploring.",
          "Not to many explanation...the ceiling in covered by an autocolant and you cannot see the builldings.",
          "This little train zooms around Avignon through very narrow streets and is a load of fun. Interesting commentary and you sit back for a very relaxing tour.",
          "If you have time do this very tourist trip. A very fast way to know and learn about the little city The train fills up quickly so be ther 15 min before it starts . There is a little sign when the trips starts",
          "A great way to see the main area of Avignon. The commentary is in several languages so will please most visitors. It gives a good overall view if you don't have too long a stay.",
          "These little road trains are a relaxing way to get a quick overview of the town centre. They start from the square outside the Popes' Palace and, other traffic permitting, take about 45 mins to get back to the start point. Seem very popular in the mornings (probably due to day",
          "The route was good and the service very friendly. The price was not bad however be aware it does not stop. You have head phones that tell you about the sites (in several languages) but the train doesn't even slow down at these sites and some of the cobbled streets were a bit",
          "After an ankle turn I hopped on the train. It's less than an hour and gives you a good overall prospective of Avignon. It cannot go through the medieval pedestrian streets but worth it if you have kids or mobility issues.",
          "We took this train on the advice of our hotel hostess, who was right -- it's a nice way to see many sights in under an hour. And you can't take a car down most of the narrow streets in old Avignon.",
          "Good way to see the city and get some background on the area. It is about a 45 minute trip and well worth it.",
          "You definitely need to take the train when in Avignon to get a brief introduction to the city. It's affordable, runs often, and provides audio tours in multiple languages. This cute little train goes down streets that seem improbable for it to fit into and it makes some",
          "I am sure this is normally a great time. On our trip, it broke down about a third of the way through. No refund of money and we had to walk about 15 minutes through an unknown neighborhood trying to find our hotel and make it to our train to Marseille on time. Very",
          "I like walking so catching a train to see the city seemed like cheating, however Avignon while a relatively small city is probably to big to explore in 2 and a bit days. The train ride goes for about 40 minutes and you can listen to a recorded history and description of the city",
          "At just 8 euros per person, this is a really cost effective tour. The small train is able to get through the narrow streets of Avignon, but the ride is a bit bumpy at times! Multi-lingual headsets provide the commentary for the roughly 45 minute journey. Trains start and end",
          "Great way to get one's bearings in the town & see lots of the main sights. Excellent audio guide. Recommended.",

          "This train (really a tractor unit and 3 trailers) is a great way to get an overview of the city. It starts off near the Popes' Palace (Palais du Pape) and tours for 45 minutes through some quite narrow and interesting streets. There is a multi-language headset available for the",
          "How they got the trailing cars to follow the drive unit into some of the narrow alleyways, I'm still not sure. The commentary is good, and the headsets work well, unless too much sideways force is applied to the outlet jack. The tour is non-stop apart from any holdups, for which",

          "There are 2 trains. Wait for the newer one. You're given a set of headphones in your language. Interesting commentary. Tour takes 45 minutes. 8 Euros each. Worth it. Starts and finishes at Palais des Papes. It doesn't stop anywhere. Take water. Great to get your bearings and",
          "This is a great way to be introduced to Avignon. Reasonably priced and just the right amount of time. You go down small alleys that you may not venture down otherwise. These revealed some hidden gems. The commentary was excellent.",
          "Interesting informative tour, featuring the best of Avignon and great way to get the see the sites you'd like to return to",
          "This was a great way to see Avignon and very informative. The train had lots of different languages available on their headsets and when we finished we went back to the places we wanted to see",
          "I always recommend the Petit Train. It doesn't travel too far as everything is pretty close by. But it's really fun weaving your way through the tiny streets. During the busy holiday periods, expect a bit of a wait to get on, sometimes 30 minutes plus. But well worth it.",
          "The lazy way to see much of Avignon centre and find out what is worth walking to. Commentary is in the language of your choice through headphones.",
          "The Petit Train takes you round all the major attractions of Avignon in an hour or so. It's the best way to get to see every 'Must see' part of the town.",
          "It was a Sunday so everyone was out and about walking , cycling generally doing weekend stuff by themselves and with their families . A trip on a tiny train gave me a good idea where everything is in Avignon, I was amused at how \"little \" - narrow ,this train was ,soon found",
          "The train cost \u20ac8, which was a bit costly for what it was. There was an audio presentation in different languages, which was quite basic, but we got an overall view of the city and maybe what to visit later. In our case, we had visited some places already, hence the comment",
          "Don't let people put you off, le Petit Train is worth the ride. You see things from a different angle and with a commentary which makes it much more interesting than walking the streets with a guidebook (OK too). Relax and enjoy in comfort, and all the children wave at you as",
          "It squeezes down narrow cobbled streets in a hair-raising (joking) ride around Avignon inside the walled city and ventures outside the wall to show the Pont de Avignon, very good value for money to acclimatise yourself of the walled city before you walk it!",
          "The little trains are always the best way to start so you can get a good look at where you want to go and what you want to do.",
          "If you have 40 minutes the train gets you past most the sights without having to walk there. Good explanation of Avignon history.",
          "The Petit Train Avignon is a nice way to get around town to the major sights without having to huff it around.",
          "This train is a great, fun way to get an overview of the town, especially if you have only a limited time. As we had the luxury of an extended stay of a week the route made us aware of places of interest that may not be on the 'top' list of things to do so we were able to plan",
          "Being a below-knee amputee I travel distances by wheelchair or mobility scooter. However, the immense raised cobbles in the square opposite the Palais du Papes in Avignon made it impossible for my husband to even attempt to push the wheelchair. Our visit to Avignon was saved",
          "I think some people think this kind of thing is a waste of time. We actually saw a few extra things we would have missed if we had not done it.",
          "The petit train was a godsend. It was virtually impossible for my husband to push my wheelchair across the large lumpy cobbles & the Palais du Papes is full of steps. It meant that we could see the main sights of Avignon in comfort, with a well-deserved commentary. It made all",
          "My opinion was its s good way to see the city but not sure Id do it . Not much to see that you can't see by taking a short walk near the Palace de Pope",
          "the little train was a good 45 minute ride around Avignon. It goes up to the top of the mountain and then down past the popes palace and along the narrow streets. The commentary is available in many languages and is pretty good. For 8 euros its well worth the trip.",
          "As soon as you get to Avigno head for the square below the \"Palais des Papes\" and take a ride on the tourist train. The commentary is informative and gives you enough information to decide as to what to visit and where to go during your stay in Avignon, giving you all the time",

          "We've taken \"le petit train\" in lots of French cities and they're always good fun and good value, particularly when you first arrive in a new city. Avignon is probably the best one we've done as you see a number of great sites such the famous bridge, the cathedral, the park",
          "We were visiting Avignon for the day and wanted to see the main sights so this was ideal. We didn't have to wait for long and it took about 40 minutes which was a helpful introduction to the city. The commentary was clear and informative and was pitched at the right level to",
          "An ideal way to see the city. The Petit Train we travelled in had head phones to point out places of interest. The cobbled streets were smoothed out by the soft ride. well worth the 8 euros.",
          "Good value for money trip, gave a great overview of Avignon which helped us to decide where we wanted to revisit on foot. We were lucky to have just the three of us in our section which meant we weren't squashed up, we did see some very tightly packed trains going round later",
          "We visited Avignon for the day and this was a fun way to get to know the city. It was also too hot to walk around everywhere so this was ideal.",
          "A reasonably comfortable 45 minute ride which takes in the main sights and weaves through some old parts of Avignon off the beaten tourist track. Stops at a superb view point above the Rhone. Well worth the time and orientates one for follow up visits on foot. The tour recording",
          "We went on this tour after 2 days of being in Avignon and realized we had already walked the same route so a bit of a waste. The train did not stop for long at the key spots so you did not get enough time to take a good photo, this was not a hop on hop off bus so you were on for",
          "If you've not been to Avignon before, this is a brilliant way to get your bearings in the town and get a quick tour of some of the key areas. We parked at the Palais de Papes car park, which is directly below the Palais, and conveniently where the train leaves from. If you",

          "My mother and I decided to take this cute little train journey in order to become acquainted with the sights and sounds of Avignon, and we weren't disappointed. For less than 10 euros, it's a no-brainer. Well worth the cash, and relaxing when the weather was so hot.",
          "We jumped on the train without much thinking and didn't regret it. For little money you get to see a lot of Avignon. The train takes you through some tiny streets so small you have no idea how the driver manages to get through. It takes you to many of the main sights but also",
          "Very relaxing being taken around. Also informative and good value. It takes about 50 minutes, but does not stop anywhere, it is just around trip.",
          "Well worth the 8 Euros for an approx 40 minute tour. It stops/slows down at several places to enable you to take photos. Very good commentary in several languages via headphones.",
          "If you have limited time in Avignon this is a good way to get your bearings and a feel for the old town and see some of the sights. The price is quite reasonable for the 40 minute tour and there is the usual audio guide in several languages to provide historical information. The",
          "Very well worth doing this train ride, saw plenty of interesting places and got a very good look at the area in short amount of time.",
          "There are some negative reviews of the train but we thought it was well worth the eight euros each. The audio guide gives a good history of the city and the sites, the pace is just right (took about an hour) and it gave us a good orientation of the city.",
          "Having hurt my foot I was wary of traipsing around Avignon and the minute I saw this little train in front of the papal palace waiting for passengers, I jumped aboard. It's a painless way of getting an overview of the city, garnering a few facts from the commentary ( available",
          "The petit train trip was corny, the headphones connected in such a way that you knock out the connection at least 4 times on the journey, the commentary was minimalist with many \"dead\" periods. HOWEVER, we found it really useful for getting our bearings, understanding the city",
          "Cute little train that can take a group of people to make a round to see the phenomenal sights of this old town, secured but bumpy, anyways, a good compliments that you experience the ride.",

          "The train was a good introduction to the layout of Avignon. Some historical information at a good pace.",
          "Fun ride but my hemorrhoids got angry that I didn't pack the Preparation H. It winds past the most significant attractions and provides very basic facts in many different languages via headphones. 4 seats per row each with a working headset in the sun shaded elongated golf",
          "Great way to get a rest from tramping after a visit to the Palais, and a nice way to get a look at the main tourist area of town without having to walk all the way through it. The streets in some places are barely wider than the train, which provides an extra little thrill to",
          "Took the train for a lazy way to see what Avignon had to offer. The cobble streets do not make for a good match - so not too expensive but if you can walk ok, give the train a miss.",

          "We took this train today in Avignon. I hoped that I will get more out of it but was somewhat disappointed. It was average for this important city and it did do it justice. The areas covered were limited for example we did not even get near the covered market (les halles), the",
          "We only visited Avignon for an afternoon. We wanted to see the enormity of the walls and the popes Palace, which was very impressive. My husband has a heart condition,and with the uneven narrow streets, we thought this would be a good way to see some of the sites. While it does",
          "For those with only a short time this little train is the best way to see the town quickly and yet enable you to grab those all important photos. The price is reasonable. This ride gives you a taste of the area and lets you plan your next visit.",
          "About 40 minute tour of city. Audio commentary; unfortunately in our carriage the system failed. When we complained we did get a refund and to their credit we later saw that they closed that carriage for the remainder of the day. A good way to get a 'feel' for the city and to",

          "I used this train twice. The first time to see the city and the second to be dropped off right outside my hotel on a public holiday when there was no transport. The latter wasn't within their remit, but goes to show how kind this train team are. Best way to see the city,",
          "A very bumpy ride through the narrow streets of Avignon - good for me as I have difficulty walking for too long. Commentary was very average.",
          "On a windy, cold day after much walking, this fun little trip around town was just what we needed. We got a break, got out of the cold, and were happy to see the city in a relaxed way.",
          "We arrived at 10am which was when the brochure said the first train would leave, the train was waiting but the next time on the board said 10? which was interesting. The man came over and told us it wouldn't leave at 10 (not enough people) but would probably leave about 10.15 to",

          "Starting in front of the Popes Palace this trip on a miniature train goes through some of the more interesting parts of the city. You can note the attractions you want to return to on foot. Commentary is in a range of languages..",
          "There were two of these trains operating whilst we were in Avignon, and they start and finish in the Place du Palais in front of the Popes Palace. The fare was \u20ac8 each for which you get a good tour of the whole town. We were very amused one day to see one of these trains going",
          "Quite amusing, more for its ability to navigate tiny twisting streets only millimetres wider than it is itself than for any informative content. Fun in a fairground way.",
          "This was a novel way to get a short brief on Avignon, kids would especially enjoy this! It wasn't too long or detailed another reason kids would enjoy! We found it helpful in getting our bearings as we were staying in the area. It was quite cramped and you couldn't pre book",
          "If you don't have a lot of time in the city, this is a good way of seeing the whole city in just 40 minutes. But, I think 8 euros is too much for what it is - just a train that transports you around town with a few short commentary through a headset (though most times I could",
          "The road train takes you through all the main sights of the old town of Avignon, along astonishingly narrow streets. The commentary is clear and the staff entertaining.",
          "We had to queue to get a seat on this tourist train, an hour later we were asking ourselves why had we bothered ! It takes you round the back streets of Avignon which you could walk around yourself and read any relevant information from the guide book . The commentary is poor",
          "Tired after a long day of sightseeing, we took the train. The Petit Train of Avignon. We saw all the sights we missed and while our friends walked to the bridge, we got there faster on the train. And in the end our friends, who opted out of the train, didn't even get these.",
          "This train ride takes you all through Avignon and hit the most visited sites. You are able then to see which sites you wished to return to later. It cost 8Euro and you wear a headset with you language. We enjoyed the ride and saw parts of the city we had missed during our",
          "Many towns in the South of France have a tour train that will take you through the area and point out stuff you may not know. This runs about an hour, and the back streets of Avignon are so narrow it can be a bit harrowing. But well worth it. Very nice multi language audio",
          "Not something I'd normally do but my wife had a knee problem that prevented her walking. Yes, you do get to see the town and whizz around the little streets (scaring the pedestrians) but you can't get off and look at anything. You can shoot pictures from the train and there is",
          "This train leaves from outside the popes palace and winds its way through many parts of Avignon. It cost \u20ac8 Euros and lasts approx 40 minutes, taking in the Rocher des Doms and many other points of interest. Multi lingual headphones are provided.",
          "Nice to have a subtle train that blends in with the surroundings rather than the garish little trains in other places. Quite an extensive round trip which takes you high up into view points and saves the hike for those less keen on hiking around. Reasonable price and popular -",
          "This little train takes you to see places in Avignon that you otherwise might miss. There is a good audio commentary to go along with the ride.",
          "Went for a trip on the train to get an overview, was a little informative, could have been more. Better to get a map and do your own thing. Helps give a quick look around if time is an issue",
          "It's difficult to see everything as you pass through the narrow streets. A bit disorienting. Otherwise, an okay way to get acquainted with the town.",
          "There experiences are always useful as an introduction to a new destination, and this was no exception. In comparison to other similar experiences, I did think the commentary was quite light-on with extended silences. The best observation i can make is that the ride provided",
          "I write this review since we decided to go on 40 minute tour for 8 euro with headset translation . The small train was nearly full and we had to take the front seats , of the last of three coaches.Bottom line is that the headsets did not work in English or any other language",
          "Great little train to see Avignon and work out what you want to venture out to see or to make sure you hadn't missed anything. Staff were great in assisting wheelchair.",
          "We took the Petit Train ride in Avignon, a 40 minute ride for 8 euros. The train bumped along the cobblestone streets with the audio guide detailing the principle sights and historic facts of Avignon. It is a good way to decide which places you want to go back and explore in",
          "If you come to visit the city for a short time, take the train and get to know the main points of interest within 1 hour. Then you can take more thorough visit where ever you like. There is a good audio explanation in several languages.",
          "Great train ride but very uncomfortable seats and a bit rough to ride in but worth the trip. The comments given during the ride was good and informed you of where we were etc.",
          "A 40 minutes tour through the city . Goes every 30-40 minutes . 8 euro .a way to see easily main attractions with 8 languages explanations .",
          "Great way to get an idea of the city. We did this before we went anywhere else and got a fix for various activities.",
          "There were two main sites, the Palais and the Bridge over the river. Much of the train tour was minor. We found the train to be good but boring.",
          "I took the train to spare my feet and get an overview of Avignon. However, my experience was not the greatest. Firstly, the English commentary would have been better if they'd got a native English speaker to record it. It was sometimes difficult to understand. Secondly, you are",
          "A cheap and fun way to get oriented in Avignon before you start exploring on foot. Be prepared for a bit of a squash and a slightly quirky ticket man.",
          "Wished we had done this at the beginning of our stay instead of at the end. Informative and fun! English dialogue with headset was great, as well as winding along the narrow streets.",
          "There is one in every city, isn't there. This one has some advantages besides the usual: it goes up the Rocher des Doms so you don't have to climb it yourself, and winding through the narrow streets at speed is a nice thrill.",
          "Like all tourist buses/trolleys, this one is good value fr 8Euro. It gave us an overview of Avignon, especially in the little winding streets.",
          "Took le petite train late on a Monday afternoon just after we arrived. Really good overview of the town and its history, well worth it as it helped us get our bearings and decided what to do over the few days we were in Avignon.",
          "Well worth a trip to get a good overview of the city before you start walking good commentory and lots of usefull information",
          "These are often a good way to get a feel for the size and layout of a town or city you are new to. Half of what this one took us to we had already seen in an hour's stroll round Avignon and rest we would have seen later in our stay. So it's OK if you are on a quick stop over but",
          "This little train was a good start to our holiday in Avignon.headsets are available in many languages. It leaves from in front of the Palace of the Popes and gives a good overview of Avignon.It takes about 40 mins. to make a circle.It goes up to theJardin du Rochers des Doms as",
          "A very nice way to see Avignon. Take the train and then decide where to go. Of course, you can walk around if you wish but it is a very nice ride.",
          "Well worth the time and money. Good historical detail and a great way to get your bearings highly recommended",
          "Early morning and no queue for this land train, it's the best way to get your bearings of the city/town. Excellent value for money too. 40 minutes well spent.",
          "Avignon is a large town and on a hot day the little train is an ideal way to see what Avignon has to offer. The suspension could be better , but overall at 9 Euros it's good value for money.",
          "A great way to see Avignon the train takes you to all the major highlights. The roads are very narrow, the train is ideal for getting around",
          "This little train trip was about 20 minutes too long. The 40 minute journey spent far too long going down dirty, ugly back streets that I really did not want to see. The suspension on the carriages was poor and towards the end I felt quite travel sick. The good part is you don't",
          "For 9 euros this is a good way to take a good break and see most of Avignon. We were able to see little narrow streets that we wanted to come back to after. It lasts 45 mins and there is audio commentary in several languages.",
          "We spotted little streets and unknown restaurants we liked the look of and then visited after whilst on the train - we all saw a bit more of the city and learnt a bit too from the commentary (which is in various languages) in the heat it was nice to sit down for a bit and relax!",
          "Well worth the money,gives you a real feel for the layout of the city.on busy days and lunchtimes it pays to book,however these can get lost. Super trip",
          "We were early in the morning on the first train and really enjoyed the views and learnt a lot about Avignon",
          "A good 45 minute tour of the city with great commentary languages. The train gets around some very intricate and small petit rues- our son loved it.",
          "This train ride through the narrow streets of Avignon is a very interesting way to see the city and learn some of its history through the multi-lingual headsets. Worth a ride.",
          "The train took us all over the city, or at least the old part of the city. Most of the time it was a recording of the area, but we didn't mind. We asked questions to the driver and coordinator as we got on and off the train. Train seemed safe and was clean.",
          "Great way to see a bit more of Avignon when you don't feel like or are not up to walking. Even though it was busy in the city the train had no problem getting around. 45 minutes was a good length to see various sights of Avignon and to decide which places to visit after the",
          "This is a great intro to Avignon, only 8 euros each, runs every 30 minutes, it takes you through the town with a commentary in various languages via headphones. You'll see some great areas of the town which you can explore later on foot.",
          "Didn't use it but saw it an awful lot and it was always full. Not really my thing as I prefer to walk around and explore. It is a great idea though for those that are less mobile to enable them to appreciate all that Avignon has to offer.",
          "Again if you are going to come to Avignon you should take the time to go on the little train - it leaves from the Palace of the Pope about every half an hour - its quit expensive again 8 euros but there is an audio guide included. Beware - no one queues properly - I was waiting",
          "We pulled up in the cab, checked into our hotel, walked up the street and got right on this train. It was a great ice breaker. We saw a little bit of everything. It was fun. It was a great introduction to how narrow the streets are, and how comfortable the local drivers are",
          "It's an easy, rapid way to do sightseeing of Avignon about in forty-five minutes. Children like very much!",
          "Not really very informativve, and limited to the old town. Spent most of time waiting for crows on the streets to move out of the way.",
          "All we knew was the nursery rhyme but Avignon is much more interesting than that. This little train runs from the square in front of the Papal Palace round town and back. The audio commentary, offering a choice of about 8 languages, was really informative and we discovered",
          "Took the train to see the city without needing to walk in the sun. Nice tour that shows you were the slopt are that interest you. Not too expensive and good audio. Seating not too soft so luckely it is not too long.",
          "Pick a quiet time, early morning seems to be best, before the coach parties arrive - as these seem to pre-book. This is quite a good way to get an overview of the city, and helps you decide which bits to further explore.",
          "We loved the little trains of France & this one was fine. I wish we could have exited the train at the top of the gardens above the Papal Palace, but it was, in all, a good tour.",
          "The train was very cute and fun (leaving about every 30 to 45 min from the Palais de Pope square) and was a good price (26 Euro for two adults two kids) and was the right length of time (40min long) and a pleasant ride (covered overtop, wide open on the sides) with good audio",
          "Not too much to say about this - it's a 40 minute train drive around Avignon, through (some very small) the streets, passing by some of this historic city's delights. The commentary is informative and, all in all, it is a good starting point for your trip. After your train",
          "Riding the Petite train (40 minutes for 8 euros) gave us an introduction to Avignon and helped us decide where we wanted to spend more time.",
          "This is very good way to see around the city and gives you ideas of where you would like to revisit. There is an audio guide included and we had to admire the driving skills needed to manoeuvre the train through the narrow streets. You get on the train from the square in front",
          "We always take hop-on or other introductory buses because they give us the lay of the land and help us get oriented. This one was fine, although in the confines of the old city with 3-4 days we had lots of time to find everything on our own.",
          "For 8 Euros you get an almost minutes ride throught he historic centre of Avignon (intra muros). Starting from in front of the papal palace it first winds its way up to some nice view points (foto op) in the papal gardens . at times it passes through alleys so narrow that you",
          "The train did not seem to go to all of the place I expected to see. What we did see was interesting. It was a very hot day and was the best way to get around,.",
          "Took us up hills that we would not have walked and showed us the Pont d'Avignon from a high point. Then took us around the town",
          "This little train was a good way to quickly see Avignon, it lasted about 45 minutes and went through the narrowest of roads which the driver somehow managed to navigate without knocking any one over of even scrapping the shop fronts, we were that close you could almost shake",
          "Takes you to all the spots that the hop on hop off does without the ability to get on and off. If you see something you want to explore you can always come back later.",
          "Spring 2014 traveled w 7 & 9 yr old kids, sweet little ride, meets description on web site. Audio is avg",
          "The audio was not great or clear. Getting in line was not clear at the time, so we missed one of the trips. Probably worth the short trip and some history.",
          "We enjoyed this trip round the town on a little train. It was a good way to get our bearings and see different parts of the town as it wended its way along the route.",
          "Great service, walk on - no queue when we were there. Guide is in English and great to be able to spot all the museums and attractions in order to map them and then go back. This has to be the first thing to grab on the first day in Avignon. Go early to get a seat and make sure",
          "The 40-minute trip was absolutely non-stop, and the taped narrative was frequently a bit out of step with what we saw. Directions like \"to the Northeast\" are also of little help in the narrow streets of the old city. Had we done this our first day in the city we might have",
          "While this is a fairly short tour, it is a great way of getting a feeling for the layout of the town. It visits all the main sights and the audio tour gives a reasonable history of the sights. If you want to avoid too much walking this will give you a great intro to the city",
          "In an 8 euro ride, over 40 minutes, we saw much of the town and its sites, getting it into perspective and enabling additional site visits Good value, time well spent - and a good driver",
          "Rode the petit train as I was with my mother who wanted to look around without the walking. Commentary is ok but not enough detail for my liking. Goes through all the little streets of Avignon so you can have a look at architecture and shops whilst sitting in the train.",
          "It's not necessary to take the train because the old city is small enough to walk, but it was fun. A good choice for people who have trouble walking.",
          "This is a quirky way of finding where all the attractions are for you to visit. Once completed the journey, go back to the attractions you want to visit.",
          "do this first on your visit to Avignan as its a great way to see the best bits of the city and get your bearings for further exploration. Reasonably priced with a good audio guide",
          "Did this the day i arrived to get a good lay of the land - it's literally a mini train that takes you around the town in less than an hour. Pick up/drop off is in the square outside of the Papal Palace so very easy.",
          "If you have to get from Gare Avignon Centre to Gare Avignon TGV or reverse, this is the only and cheapest (1 euro) way to do it.",
          "You don't take these things for comfort anywhere in the world and Avignon is no exception. They bump, they rattle, the seats are hard and uncomfortable but the views are great. It passes all the worthwhile places to visit and, if as we were time-limited, it helps to pick the",
          "This train, which was more like an extended golf cart, was a cool way to get oriented to the city. It was great for the day we arrived, because we could just get an idea about what there was to see in Avignon and get oriented to the city.",
          "See a lot of Avignon in less than an hour. Starts in front of the Palais des Papes & winds it's way around this beautiful city. It takes a good driver to navigate the narrow streets & sharp turns & ours did just that. We saw things we might have missed otherwise. Good deal @ 7",
          "We had been wandering around on a Sunday morning trying to get the sense of Avignon. As we approached the square near the Papal Palace, we saw a little tour train pull in. We went up to the conductor who was working to set up shop. For 7 euros each we had a seat on the train and",
          "Once you have walked around the grotto there is not a lot for children in Avignon, but the train is a must do. A good value compared to similar rides in other locarions it gives you a quick tour of the town in a fun way. Pick it up in front of the Popes Palace and enjoy the town.",
          "It was a second visit to Avignon and this time there was a train that toured the roadways so we hopped on. Seven Euros and well worth the price, the train is open-topped so probably not so good on a rainy or windy day. This particular day was sunny and warm and the journey",
          "Thru the streets of Avignon, we enjoyed a quick, bumpy, petite train ride in the early evening with an English audio-guide. We were whipped around and about the city thru narrow streets, streets of Art Noveau buildings, streets with Marion (Virgin Mary) niches and views of the",
          "A good way to see the city in 45 minutes to orientate yourself, or just to ride around and listen to the commentary through the headsets provided. It's a squeeze in places because of the narrow streets and bumpy on the cobbles - but a lot of fun.",
          "Very typical 40 minute tourist ride of the area around the Pope's Palace and the surrounding downtown area for 6 or 7 Euros as I recall. You'll see a few of the highlights on this bumpy ride. If you're pressed for time, or not up to the walk, give it a try, otherwise, just get a",
          "The little train is an excellent way to see Avignon before making a decision on what specific areas you may wish to visit. The journey lasts approximately 45 minutes and takes you around quite a bit of the city. It starts from the steps near the Pope's Palace, goes down to the",
          "this little train was a good way on my first day in Avignon when I was exhausted from the trip down from Paris, the disappointment of seeing where my travel companion had booked our lodging and then my having to go find a new hotel, etc., this was a good intro to what Avignon",
          "The 45-minute tram ride provides a respite from walking on cobblestones and provides a great overview of the walled city.",
          "Do go on this train to get a good overview of the place, and the history, then if you are short of time you can pick the best for you. We used these trains in several cities in France.",
          "This was fun, we spent a good hour slowly going through Avignon seeing places we may have missed had we been walking. The headsets provide a lot of information we would not have learned otherwise. Good value.",
          "A great way to get your bearings and to learn more about Avignon. The headphones provide commentary in a dozen different languages. Trip takes about 40 minutes and some of the streets it travels on are very tight! It's four Euros - but is good value. Starts and finishes outside",
          "Yes, its an affordable 7 EUR trip but the experience was boring beyond belief. Imagine getting onto a small tram, putting on a pair of sweaty headphones (its warm and the headphones are used multiple times throughout the day so you can imagine!) and then listening to the",
          "Good way to see the sights & get some history of Avignon. Also good for the less able as to walk the town is difficult in the hot months",
          "We waited 25 minutes to take the last train of the day. While waiting the driver sat at a nearby table with a beverage and a smoke. Ok to take a break, but then...the driver decided he was done and told us to come back in the morning. We were leaving early the next day, so",
          "Over priced and boring. Do the Avignon walking food tour instead. Personal guide who is very knowledgeable about Avignon's history and takes you off the beaten track for a more authentic look at Avignon from a local perspective.",
          "We have used these trains in several locations and found them to be a great way to see the sights. However on this occasion we had some major issues. This is the first time we had to buy tickets 'on the train'. Elsewhere the tickets were purchased from a ticket office which",
          "Very good starting point for exploring Avignon. For 7 euros you can have a very good look of Avignon, especially its cobbled and narrow streets. It is the bumpy ride, but fun and informative. Audio guide is quite good and there are lot of opportunities to take some nice photos",
          "Nice 30-40 minute tour with audio of the town. Bumpy ride, hard seats but a good respite from the 93 degree heat walking around today.",
          "It is a very appealing looking train (which really is a bus/cart in the design of a train). It takes you all around the interests of the area with an audio headset to guide you (in various languages). The suspension is only good if you have some padding as the seats are hard",
          "A nice introduction to the city and somewhere cooler on a hot afternoon. We found the audio guide perfectly audible, unlike other reviewers. The train does get pretty bouncy on the cobbled streets. If you find sitting uncomfortable you will want a cushion as the seats are",
          "For a cheap tour with an onboard audio guide in 8 languages. It's the thing to do when arriving in Avignon to help you get your bearings and understand what is around Avignon. You don't need to pre purchase tickets and tours run about every 30 minutes (there was a black board",
          "terrific way to tour the walled city with commentary via head phones. this is an easy way to get all the information and see the sights.phones.ones.",
          "I am satisfied to take it. It took only 4.5 euros but it took more than 45 mins. It is easy to visit the town.",
          "Forty minutes for an orientation of Avignon is well worth the 7 euros. The train drivers are amazing driving through some tight spaces. We experienced the minstral winds, so didn't go back to walk some of the areas pointed out during the tour...had the weather cooperated we",
          "Best way to see the town and the identify those places to explore independently. Good value. Recorded commentary in many languages.",
          "Excellent way to trundle around Avignon up and down narrow lanes. Sound system one of the best we have eperienced with entertaining commentary. Great value",
          "We enjoyed the break the train provided from the mistral winds buffeting the area near the Pope's palace on the day we visited. The headphones that were supposed to provide an English version of what was being said were not working while we took the trip so we did not know what",
          "40 minutes for a brief look of the main monuments in avignon on board of a small train for 7 euros. You' ll get what you expect if you like this stuff.",
          "We found this an excellent way to get an overview of Avignon as you squeeze through narrow streets and open vistas. The headphones narration was helpful as we gained ideas of where we wanted to visit more.",
          "The train was very organized. You could select the language to be spoken so everyone understands. You get a brief history of the the building and sites with an overview of the city so you can choose the specific sites or areas you would like to return to. Great to get a",
          "The train was very bumpy and the route was partly very badly chosen. The worst was the recorded guide that was at times in the wrong place and mostly babbled out too much information in a short time. Maybe ok if you want to take your under 5 for a ride.",
          "Found this little train by chance whilst sitting in a square, and it was excellent value at Euro7 per person. We had English commentary whilst we wound around the narrow cobble-stone streets, which seemed hardly wide enough to take the little bendy train. It was a most",
          "Bit bumpy on the cobbled, narrow streets, but the driver was obviously well used to the route! Lots to see, 40 minutes well spent.",
          "I left Chicago arrived in Avignon 15 hours later. I heard about the train in guide books and it sounded like a great way to get a layout of the city. The train leaves near the main entrance to the Palace of the Popes. Maybe it was the long day and full sun that made this ride",
          "We decided on the spur of the moment to take this train ride, and whilst it was quite enjoyable seeing the back streets of Avignon and some interesting sites, there were a few down sides to the trip. It was difficult for elderly passengers to get on and off the train as there",
          "Perfect opportunity to learn about Avignon in a relaxing 45 minute tour. I sat on the outside seat and was able to take some good photos of areas that we saw , but were not necessarily going to visit.",
          "We found that doing trips on these little tourist trains were the best way of becoming familiar with a city layout and a bit of leisurely fun. Sitting in the train and being led through winding streets we were taken to the Jewish quarter and also through all the pedestrian only",
          "This was a great way to see the city. We did not have much time so it enabled us to see all the main sites within a short period.",
          "We saw some parts of Avignon we wouldn't have noticed and had an interesting commentary. It would be very busy in summer as people rushed on in front of us and we waited for another which came very quickly. We went up onto the Rocher and saw the famous bridge as well as going",
          "Not the most comfortable 40 minutes of travel I gave experienced but I saw a lot and got information about the city I might otherwise never have had. The seats are small and tightly squeezed together, so if you end up as I did sitting next to a gentleman of generous proportions",
          "Excellent way to have a quick and confortable view of almost everything in Avignon. A lot of information by the audio guide. Quite cheap ( 7 euros )",
          "This was a very nice way to see Avignon. It goes on a 35-40 minute circuit with audio commentary. The only downside is that you cannot get off at any point.",
          "The train was a nice way to ride for 40 minutes or so while seeing the sights of Avignon. The commentary was fine and for the price it was a good thing to do.",
          "We were in Avignon only for half a day thus a trip by the little train was a great opportunity to get a quick tour of the city, enjoy the panoramic views and get a feeling of the city. We really liked it.",
          "The little train took us on a trip through the tiny streets but the English translation was hard to follow as the speaker mispronounced so many words. We had to give up but enjoyed the ride.",
          "Avignon is not really designed for a tourist ride of this type. The 'train' is noisy, uncomfortable and it squeezes along tiny streets and around awkward turns, pressing walking tourists up against walls and narrowly avoiding grinding the sides of parked cars. After taking the",
          "The Petit Train Avignon was a disappointment. The audio through my headphones was tough to hear over the French version coming through the open speakers. The view of the Pont Saint-Benezet was quick with no time for a photo op. The circuit the Petit Train takes is just not",
          "Avignon is an easy walk about old town. I had done that the day before so the train ride didn't really show me anything new but it was relaxing to be driven around and I did hear a few more details about the history of what I had seen. If you haven't already walked the town on",

          "This little train was a treat crawling along very narrow streets and even going outside the walls. A good way to get a feel for anywhere you would like to return to. It leaves from the large square near Place of the Popes and costs 7 Euros each, takes about 45 minutes. It is",
          "A nice way to rest your feet and see Avignon with narrow streets that the train reaches. The kids loved the train and it only took 40 minutes so it was just right!",

          "This little tourist train (and I usually hate these things) will take you into areas of Avignon that you might otherwise miss. It was my wife's idea - one that initially resisted, but dare I say, she was right. We were in Avignon for a few days an this little 40-minute ride",
          "This little road train covers a fairly limited amount of Avignon and is let down by long periods of silnce in the commentary, whihc is not always easy to hear (on my head set the connection was dodgy). Unless you want to ride around, buying a guide book from the tourist office",
          "Great way to see Avignon in a short time. Make sure if you are listening on the head phones you are turned up loud to hear over the French version on loud speaker. Incredible how it goes through very narrow streets. Pauses for photos.",
          "Normally I enjoy a tour of a new city when I first arrive, but I after this tour, I felt like I could have saved the 7 euros and wouldn't have missed anything. It wasn't terrible, just not very interesting.",
          "Well worth it at the start of a visit to Avignon and then we had a much better idea of what we wanted to go back to.",
          "Most small trains have individual headphones with multiple languages. Ours just had a PA announcement that narrated in several languages, possibly cued by the driver. Ours was French, English, and German. The train whirs you through the old city, up and down streets, missing",
          "This actually takes you around areas you may not walk to, so you see more of the city that if on foot. It was not a bad way to go, especially if you are tired or not able to walk around.",
          "We took this train to avoid walking up to Rocher des Doms but unfortunately, it doesn't make stops so you don't see much of the gardens. It's a quick way to tour around Avignon but walking is better. After the train ride ended, we walked up to the gardens to see them",

          "We took the train to orient ourselves to the city and are so very glad we did. The train takes you to the very top into the gardens of the Palais du Papes. Turns out we would not have been able to make the steep hike up to see them. You see all the major sights and explore",
          "An enjoyable 40 mins tour around the City, able to travel along the narrow medieval streets, clear commentary.",
          "If you are going to get on the train make it the first thing you do in Avignon. Avignon is not huge so if you walk around for a couple of hours you will see most of where the train takes you. I decided to take the train as it had an multi lingual commentary via headphones and",
          "Good little tour of the old city. Took us to places higher up that, at our age, we would not have walked to. There are headphones in a variety of languages. Ride a little bumpy, but after all it was over paving stones. Worth the 7Euros.",
          "This is an interesting 40 minute tour that is narrated in different languages. It costs 7 euros. There are no stops and you pick it up near the Popes Palace and it winds around parts of the historic district.",
          "For 7 euro, you get a great overview of Avignon. Really good for a sight of the cathedral especially if you don't want to climb the stairs or the ramp.",
          "The train ride was spoilt by a poor commentary - hard to follow through the headphones with music and French commentary broadcast at the same time.",
          "This little train is well worth the few dollars it costs to ride through the little streets of Avignon. Don't miss a chance to relax while viewing the sites.",
          "This train is a good investment in that the ride gives you a good overview of the old city. You can then go back to the areas that interest you.",
          "if you only have a few hours in Avignon, then the little train is a must to see an overview of all the sites of this wonderful city. but also try to go up to the top of the hill for an overview, see the bridge and take in some of the cafes!",

          "This was the first thing we did on our arrival in Avignon and it was great for getting our bearings of the area. The train took us on a tour of the little cobbled streets in Avignon, and it wasn't as bumpy a ride as I had expected from reading the previous reviews. There is",
          "Not as cute as many little trains but a good way to see the town if you are short of time or find walking in the heat hard. The commentary is good and the views from the palace gardens are amazing. Gave us ideas of where to go back. We also booked the half day visit to the Pont",
          "Gives you a good idea of what Avignon has to offer and were it is. Plus at \u20ac7 it beats walking in the heat. A good audio comentry english too. If it only alowed you on and off it would be perfect. To be honest did not ask for this as there only seemed to be the hole 3/4 hour",
          "Great ride on a hot July summer. The trains takes you to important routes explaining as it goes along, sometimes along very narrow streets. We really appreciate the skillful driver. We recommend all to take this to have a summarise version of Avignon before deciding on visiting",

        "wiki": "The following is a history of Avignon, France.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\nThe site of Avignon has been occupied since the Neolithic period as shown by excavations at Rocher des Doms and the Balance district.In 1960 and 1961 excavations in the northern part of the Rocher des Doms directed by Sylvain Gagni\u00e8re uncovered a small anthropomorphic stele (height: 20 cm), which was found in an area of land being reworked. Carved in Burdigalian sandstone, it has the shape of a \"tombstone\" with its face engraved with a highly stylized human figure with no mouth and whose eyes are marked by small cavities. On the bottom, shifted slightly to the right is a deep indentation with eight radiating lines forming a solar representation - a unique discovery for this type of stele.\nCompared to other similar solar figures this stele representing the \"first Avignonnais\" and comes from the time period between the Copper Age and the Early Bronze Age which is called the southern Chalcolithic.This was confirmed by other findings made in this excavation near the large water reservoir on top of the rock where two polished greenstone axes were discovered, a lithic industry characteristic of \"shepherds of the plateaux\". There were also some Chalcolithic objects for adornment and an abundance of Hallstatt pottery shards which could have been native or imported (Ionian or Phocaean).\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\n\nThe name of the city dates back to around the 6th century BC. The first citation of Avignon (Aouen(n)ion) was made by Artemidorus of Ephesus. Although his book, The Journey, is lost it is known from the abstract by Marcian of Heraclea and The Ethnics, a dictionary of names of cities by Stephanus of Byzantium based on that book. He said: \"The City of Massalia (Marseille), near the Rhone, the ethnic name (name from the inhabitants) is Avenionsios (Avenionensis) according to the local name (in Latin) and Auenionit\u00e8s according to the Greek expression\". This name has two interpretations: \"city of violent wind\" or, more likely, \"lord of the river\". The Celtic tribes named it Auoention around the beginning of the Christian Era. Other sources trace its origin to the Gallic mignon (\"marshes\") and the Celtic definitive article.\n\nAvignon was a simple Greek Emporium founded by Phocaeans from Marseille around 539 BC. It was in the 4th century BC that the Massaliotes (people from Marseilles) began to sign treaties of alliance with some cities in the Rhone valley including Avignon and Cavaillon. A century later Avignon was part of the \"region of Massaliotes\" or \"country of Massalia\".Fortified on its rock, the city later became and long remained the capital of the Cavares. With the arrival of the Roman legions in 120 BC. the Cavares, allies with the Massaliotes, became Roman. Under the domination of the Roman Empire, Aouenion became Avennio and was now part of Gallia Narbonensis (118 BC.), the first Transalpine province of the Roman Empire. Very little from this period remains (a few fragments of the forum near Rue Moli\u00e8re). It later became part of the 2nd Viennoise. Avignon remained a \"federated city\" with Marseille until the conquest of Marseille by Trebonius and Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, Caesar's lieutenants. It became a city of Roman law in 49 BC. It acquired the status of Roman colony in 43 BC. Pomponius Mela placed it among the most flourishing cities of the province.Over the years 121 and 122 the Emperor Hadrian stayed in the Province where he visited Vaison, Orange, Apt, and Avignon. He gave Avignon the status of a Roman colony: \"Colonia Julia Hadriana Avenniensis\" and its citizens were enrolled in the tribu.Following the passage of Maximian, who was fighting the Bagaudes, the Gallic peasants revolted. The first wooden bridge was built over the Rhone linking Avignon to the right bank. It has been dated by dendrochronology to the year 290. In the 3rd century there was a small Christian community outside the walls around what was to become the Abbey of Saint-Ruf.\n\n\n== Early Middle Ages ==\n\nAlthough the date of the Christianization of the city is not known with certainty, it is known that the first evangelizers and prelates were within the hagiographic tradition which is attested by the participation of Nectarius, the first historical Bishop of Avignon on 29 November 439, in the regional council in the Cathedral of Riez assisted by the 13 bishops of the three provinces of Arles.\nThe memory of St. Eucherius still clings to three vast caves near the village of Beaumont whither, it is said, the people of Lyon had to go in search of him in 434 when they sought him to make him their archbishop.\nIn November 441 Nectarius of Avignon, accompanied by his deacon Fontidius, participated in the Council of Orange convened and chaired by Hilary of Arles where the Council Fathers defined the right of asylum. In the following year, together with his assistants Fonteius and Saturninus, he was at the first Council of Vaison with 17 bishops representing the Seven Provinces. He died in 455.\n\nInvasions began and during the inroads of the Goths it was heavily damaged. In 472 Avignon was sacked by the Burgundians and replenished by the Patiens, from the city of Lyon, who sent them wheat.In 500 Clovis I, King of the Franks, attacked Gundobad, King of the Burgundians who was accused of the murder of the father of his wife Clotilde. Beaten, Gondebaud left Lyon and took refuge in Avignon with Clovis besieging it. Gregory of Tours reported that the Frankish king devastated the fields, cut down the vines and olive trees, and destroyed the orchards. The Burgundian was saved by the intervention of the Roman General Aredius. He had called him to his aid against the \"Frankish barbarians\" who ruined the countryside.\nIn 536 Avignon, following the fate of Provence, was ceded to the Merovingians by Vitiges, the new king of the Ostrogoths. Chlothar I annexed Avignon, Orange, Carpentras, and Gap; Childebert I took Arles and Marseilles; Theudebert I took Aix, Apt, Digne, and Glandev\u00e8s. The Emperor Justinian I at Constantinople approved the division.\nDespite all the invasions, intellectual life continued to flourish on the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne. Gregory of Tours noted that after the death of Bishop Antoninus in 561 the Parisian Father Dommole refused the bishopric of Avignon after Chlothar I convinced him that it would be ridiculous \"in the middle of tired senators, sophists, and philosophical judges\"\nSt. Magnus was a Gallo-Roman senator who became a monk and then bishop of the city. His son, St. Agricol (Agricolus), bishop between 650 and 700, is the patron saint of Avignon.\nThe 7th and 8th centuries were the darkest period in the history of Avignon. The city became the prey of the Franks under Thierry II (Theodoric), King of Austrasia in 612. The Council of Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne in 650 was the last to indicate the Episcopal participation of the Provence dioceses. In Avignon there would be no bishop for 205 years with the last known holder being Agricola.In 734 it fell into the hands of the Saracens, and it was destroyed in 737 by the Franks under Charles Martel for having sided with the Saracens against him.\nA centralized government was put in place and, in 879, the bishop of Avignon, Ratfred, with other Proven\u00e7al colleagues, went to the Synod of Mantaille in Viennois where Boso was elected King of Provence after the death of Louis the Stammerer.The Rh\u00f4ne could again be crossed since in 890 part of the ancient bridge of Avignon was restored at the pier No. 14 near Villeneuve. In that same year Louis, the son of Boson, succeeded his father. His election took place in the Synod of Varennes near Macon. Thibert, who was his most effective supporter, became Count of Apt. In 896 Thibert acted as plenipotentiary of the king at Avignon, Arles, and Marseille with the title of \"Governor-General of all the counties of Arles and Provence\". Two years later, at his request, King Louis donated B\u00e9darrides to the priest Rigmond d'Avignon.\nOn 19 October 907 King Louis the Blind became emperor and restored an island in the Rhone to Remigius, Bishop of Avignon. This charter is the first mention of a cathedral dedicated to Mary.After the capture and the execution of his cousin, Louis III, who had been exiled to Italy in 905, Hugh of Arles became regent and personal advisor to King Louis. He exercised most of the powers of the king of Provence and in 911, when Louis III gave him the titles of Duke of Provence and Marquis of the Viennois, he left Vienne and moved to Arles which was the original seat of his family and which now was the new capital of Provence.\nOn 2 May 916 Louis the Blind restored the churches of Saint-Ruf and Saint-G\u00e9ni\u00e8s to the diocese of Avignon. On the same day Bishop Fulcherius attested in favour of his canons and for the two churches of Notre-Dame and Saint-\u00c9tienne to form a cathedral.A political event of importance took place in 932 with the reunion of the kingdom of Provence with Upper Burgundy. This union formed the Kingdom of Arles in which Avignon was one of the largest cities.\nAt the end of the 9th century, Muslim Spain installed a military base in Fraxinet since they had led the plundering expeditions in the Alps throughout the 10th century.\nDuring the night of 21 to 22 July 972 the Muslims took dom Mayeul, the Abbot of Cluny who was returning from Rome, prisoner. They asked for one livre for each of them which came to 1,000 livres, a huge sum, which was paid to them quickly. Ma\u00efeul was released in mid-August and returned to Cluny in September.\n\nIn September 973 William I of Provence and his brother Rotbold, sons of the Count of Avignon, Boso II, mobilized all the nobles of Provence on behalf of dom Ma\u00efeul. With the help of Ardouin, Marquis of Turin, and after two weeks of siege, Proven\u00e7al troops chased the Saracens from their hideouts in Fraxinet and Ramatuelle as well as those at Peirimpi near Noyers in the Jabron valley. William and Roubaud earned their title of Counts of Provence. William had his seat at Avignon and Roubaud at Arles.\nIn 976 while Bermond, brother-in-law of Eyric was appointed Viscount of Avignon by King Conrad the Peaceful on 1 April, the Cartulary of Notre-Dame des Doms in Avignon says that Bishop Landry restored rights that had been unjustly appropriated to the canons of Saint-\u00c9tienne. He gave them a mill and two houses he built for them on the site of the current Trouillas Tower at the papal palace. In 980 these canons were constituted in a canonical chapter by Bishop Garnier.\nIn 994 Dom Ma\u00efeul arrived in Avignon where his friend William the Liberator was dying. He assisted in his last moments on the island facing the city (the \u00cele de la Barthelasse) on the Rhone. The Count had as successor the son he had by his second wife Alix. He would reign jointly with his uncle Rotbold under the name William II. In the face of County and episcopal power, the town of Avignon organized itself. Towards the year 1000 there was already a proconsul B\u00e9ranger with his wife Gilberte who are known to have founded an abbey at \"Castrum Caneto\".In 1032 when Conrad II inherited the Kingdom of Arles, Avignon was attached to the Holy Roman Empire. The Rhone was now a border that could only be crossed on the old bridge at Avignon. Some Avignon people still use the term \"Empire Land\" to describe the Avignon side, and \"Kingdom Land\" to designate the Villeneuve side to the west which was in the possession of the King of France.\n\n\n== Late Middle Ages ==\n\nAfter the division of the empire of Charlemagne, Avignon came within the Kingdom of Arles or Kingdom of the Two Burgundies, and was owned jointly by the Count of Provence and the Count of Toulouse. From 1060, the Count of Forcalquier also had nominal overlordship, until these rights were resigned to the local Bishops and Consuls in 1135.\nWith the German rulers at a distance, Avignon set up an autonomous administration with the creation of a consulat in 1129, two years before its neighbour Arles.\nIn 1209 the Council of Avignon ordered a second excommunication for Raymond VI of Toulouse.At the end of the twelfth century, Avignon declared itself an independent republic, and sided with Raymond VII of Toulouse during the Albigensian Crusade. In 1226, the citizens refused to open the gates of Avignon to King Louis VIII of France and the papal legate. They besieged the city for three months (10 June-12 September). Avignon was captured and forced to pull down its ramparts and fill up its moat.\nAt the end of September, a few days after the surrender of the city to the troops of King Louis VIII, Avignon experienced severe flooding.In 1249 the city again declared itself a republic on the death of Raymond VII, his heirs being on a crusade.\nOn 7 May 1251, however, the city was forced to submit to two younger brothers of King Louis IX, Alphonse of Poitiers and Charles of Anjou (Charles I of Naples). They were heirs through the female line of the Marquis and Count of Provence, and thus co-lords of the city. After the death of Alphonse in 1271, Philip III of France inherited his share of Avignon and passed it to his son Philip the Fair in 1285. It passed in turn in 1290 to Charles II of Naples, who thereafter remained the sole lord of the entire city.\nThe University of Avignon was founded by Pope Boniface VIII in 1303 and was famed as a seat of legal studies, flourishing until the French Revolution (1792).\n\n\n== Avignon papacy ==\n\nIn 1309 the city, still part of the Kingdom of Arles, was chosen by Pope Clement V as his residence at the time of the Council of Vienne and, from 9 March 1309 until 13 January 1377, Avignon, rather than Rome was the seat of the Papacy. At the time the city and its surroundings (the Comtat Venaissin) were ruled by the kings of Sicily of the House of Anjou. The French King Philip the Fair, who had inherited from his father all the rights of Alphonse de Poitiers (the last Count of Toulouse), made them over to Charles II, King of Naples and Count of Provence (1290). Nonetheless, Philip was a shrewd ruler. Inasmuch as the eastern banks of the Rh\u00f4ne marked the edge of his kingdom, when the river flooded up into the city of Avignon, Philip taxed the city since during periods of flood, the city technically lay within his domain.\nAvignon became the Pontifical residence under Pope Clement V in 1309. His successor, John XXII, a former bishop of the diocese, made it the capital of Christianity and transformed his former episcopal palace into the primary Palace of the Popes. It was Benedict XII who built the Old Palace and his successor Clement VI the New Palace. He bought the town on 9 June 1348 from Joanna I of Naples, the Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence for 80,000 florins. Innocent VI endowed the ramparts.Under their rule, the Court seethed and attracted many merchants, painters, sculptors and musicians. Their palace, the most remarkable building in the International Gothic style was the result, in its construction and ornamentation, of the joint work of the best French architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean du Louvres (called Loubi\u00e8res) and the larger frescoes from the School of Siena: Simone Martini and Matteo Giovanetti.The papal library in Avignon was the largest in Europe in the 14th century with 2,000 volumes Around the library were a group of passionate clerics of letters who were pupils of Petrarch, the founder of Humanism. At the same time the Clementine Chapel, called the Grande Chapelle, attracted composers, singers, and musicians including Philippe de Vitry, inventor of the Ars Nova, and Johannes Ciconia.As Bishop of Cavaillon, Cardinal Philippe de Cabassoles, Lord of Vaucluse, was the great protector of the Renaissance poet Petrarch.\nUrban V took the first decision to return to Rome, to the delight of Petrarch, but the chaotic situation there with different conflicts prevented him from staying there. He died shortly after his return to Avignon.His successor, Gregory XI, also decided to return to Rome and this ended the first period of the Avignon Papacy. When Gregory XI brought the seat of the papacy to Rome in 1377, the city of Avignon was administered by a legate.The early death of Gregory XI, however, caused the Great Schism. Clement VII and Benedict XIII reigned again in Avignon Overall therefore it was nine popes who succeeded in the papal palace and enriched themselves during their pontificate.From then on until the French Revolution, Avignon and the Comtat were papal possessions: first under the schismatic popes of the Great Schism, then under the popes of Rome ruling via legates until 1542, and then by vice-legates. The Black Death appeared at Avignon in 1348 killing almost two-thirds of the city's population.In all seven popes and two anti-popes resided in Avignon:\n\nClement V: 1305\u20131314 (curia moved to Avignon March 9, 1309)\nJohn XXII: 1316\u20131334\nBenedict XII: 1334\u20131342\nClement VI: 1342\u20131352\nInnocent VI: 1352\u20131362\nUrban V: 1362\u20131370 (in Rome 1367-1370; returned to Avignon 1370)\nGregory XI: 1370\u20131378 (left Avignon to return to Rome on September 13, 1376)Anti-PopesClement VII (1378-1394)\nBenedict XIII (1394-1403)The walls that were built by the popes in the years immediately following the acquisition of Avignon as papal territory are well preserved. As they were not particularly strong fortifications, the Popes relied instead on the immensely strong fortifications of their palace, the \"Palais des Papes\". This immense Gothic building, with walls 17\u201318 feet thick, was built 1335\u20131364 on a natural spur of rock, rendering it all but impregnable to attack. After its capture following the French Revolution, it was used as a barracks and prison for many years but it is now a museum.\nAvignon, which at the beginning of the 14th century was a town of no great importance, underwent extensive development during the time the seven Avignon popes and two anti-popes, Clement V to Benedict XIII, resided there. To the north and south of the rock of the Doms, partly on the site of the Bishop's Palace that had been enlarged by John XXII, was built the Palace of the Popes in the form of an imposing fortress consisting of towers linked to each other and named as follows: La Campane, Trouillas, La Glaci\u00e8re, Saint-Jean, Saints-Anges (Benedict XII), La G\u00e2che, La Garde-Robe (Clement VI), Saint-Laurent (Innocent VI). The Palace of the Popes belongs, by virtue of its severe architecture, to the Gothic art of the South of France. Other noble examples can be seen in the churches of Saint-Didier, Saint-Pierre, and Saint Agricol as well as in the Clock Tower and in the fortifications built between 1349 and 1368 for a distance of some three miles (4.8 km) flanked by thirty-nine towers, all of which were erected or restored by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe popes were followed to Avignon by agents (or factors) of the great Italian banking-houses who settled in the city as money-changers and as intermediaries between the Apostolic Camera and its debtors. They lived in the most prosperous quarter of the city which was known as the Exchange. A crowd of traders of all kinds brought to market the produce necessary for maintaining the numerous courts and for the visitors who flocked to it: grain and wine from Provence, the south of France, Roussillon, and the country around Lyon. Fish was brought from places as distant as Brittany; rich cloth and tapestries came from Bruges and Tournai. The account-books of the Apostolic Camera, which are still kept in the Vatican archives, give an idea of the trade of which Avignon became the centre. The university founded by Boniface VIII in 1303 had many students under the French popes. They were drawn there by the generosity of the sovereign pontiffs who rewarded them with books or benefices.\n\n\n== Early modern period ==\nAfter the restoration of the Papacy in Rome the spiritual and temporal government of Avignon was entrusted to a Legate, notably the Cardinal-nephew, who was replaced in his absence by a vice-legate (unlike the legate he was usually a commoner and not a cardinal). Pope Innocent XII abolished nepotism and the office of Legate in Avignon on 7 February 1693, handing over its temporal government in 1692 to the Congregation of Avignon (i.e. a department of the papal Curia which resided in Rome), with the Cardinal Secretary of State as presiding prefect, who exercised their jurisdiction through the vice-legate. This congregation, to which appeals were made from the decisions of the vice-legate, was linked to the Congregation of Loreto within the Roman Curia. In 1774 the vice-legate was made president thus depriving him of almost all authority. The office was done away with under Pope Pius VI on 12 June 1790.\nThe Public Council, composed of forty-eight councillors chosen by the people, four members of the clergy, and four doctors from the university, met under the presidency of the chief magistrate of the city: the viquier (Occitan) or representative of the papal Legate or Vice-legate who annually nominated a man for the post. The councillors' duty was to watch over the material and financial interests of the city but their resolutions had to be submitted to the vice-legate for approval before being put in force. Three consuls, chosen annually by the Council, had charge of the administration of the streets.\nAvignon's survival as a papal enclave was, however, somewhat precarious, as the French crown maintained a large standing garrison at Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon just across the river.\nOn the death of the Archbishop of Arles, Philippe de L\u00e9vis in 1475, Pope Sixtus IV in Rome reduced the size of the diocese of Arles: he detached the diocese of Avignon in the province of Arles and raised it to the rank of an archbishopric in favour of his nephew Giuliano della Rovere, who later became Pope Julius II. The Archdiocese of Avignon had canonic jurisdiction over the department of Vaucluse and was an archdiocese under the bishoprics of Comtadins Carpentras, Cavaillon, and Vaison-la-Romaine.From the fifteenth century onward it became the policy of the Kings of France to rule Avignon as part of their kingdom. In 1476 Louis XI, upset that Charles of Bourbon was made legate, sent troops to occupy the city until his demands that Giuliano della Rovere be made legate. Once Rovere was made a cardinal he withdrew his troops from the city.\nIn the 15th century Avignon suffered a major flood of the Rhone. King Louis XI repaired a bridge in October 1479 by letters patent.In 1536 king Francis I of France invaded the papal territory, in order to overthrow Emperor Charles V, who was emperor of the territory. When he entered the city the people received him very well, and in return for the reception the people were all granted to them the same privileges that French subjects enjoyed, such as being able to hold state offices.\nIn 1562 the city was besieged by the Fran\u00e7ois de Beaumont, baron des Adrets, who wanted to avenge the massacre of Orange.Charles IX passed through the city during his royal tour of France (1564-1566) together with his court and nobles of the kingdom: his brother the Duke of Anjou, Henry of Navarre, the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine The court stayed for three weeks.\n\nIn 1583 King Henry III attempted to offer an exchange of the Marquisate of Saluzzo for Avignon, however his offer was refused by Pope Gregory XIII.\nIn 1618 Cardinal Richelieu was exiled in Avignon.The city was visited by Vincent de Paul in 1607 and also by Francis de Sales in 1622.In 1663 in retaliation for the attack led by the Corsican Guard on the attendants of the Duc de Cr\u00e9qui, the ambassador of Louis XIV in Rome, the King of France attacked and seized Avignon, which at the time was considered an important and integral part of the French Kingdom by the provincial Parliament of Provence.\nIn 1688 yet another attempt was made to occupy Avignon, however the attempt failed, and from 1688 to 1768 Avignon was at peace with no occupations or wars during that time.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century the streets of Avignon were narrow and winding but buildings changed and houses gradually replaced the old buildings. Around the city there were mulberry plantations, orchards, and grasslands.On 2 January 1733 Fran\u00e7ois Mor\u00e9nas founded a newspaper, the Courrier d'Avignon, whose name changed over time and through prohibitions. As it was published in the papal enclave outside the kingdom of France and Monaco, the newspaper escaped the control system of the press in France (privilege with permission) while undergoing control from papal authorities. The Courrier d'Avignon appeared from 1733 to 1793 with two interruptions: one between July 1768 and August 1769 due to the annexation of Avignon to France and the other between 30 November 1790 and 24 May 1791.King Louis XV occupied the Comtat Venaissin from 1768 to 1774 and substituted French institutions for those in force with the approval of the people of Avignon; a French party grew up.\n\n\n== From the French Revolution to the end of the 19th century ==\n\nOn 12 September 1791 the National Constituent Assembly voted for the annexation of Avignon and the reunion of Comtat Venaissin with the kingdom of France following a referendum submitted to the inhabitants of the Comtat.\nOn the night of 16 to 17 October 1791, after the lynching by a mob of the secretary-clerk of the commune who was wrongly suspected of wanting to seize church property, the event called the Massacres of La Glaci\u00e8re took place, when 60 people were summarily executed and thrown into the dungeon of the tower on the Palais des Papes.\nOn 7 July 1793 federalist insurgents under General Rousselet entered Avignon. During their passage along the Durance to retake the city by troops from Marseilles one person was killed: Joseph Agricol Viala. On 25 July General Carteaux appeared before the city and it was abandoned the next day by the troops of General Rousselet as a result of a misinterpretation of orders from Marseille.On 25 June 1793 Avignon and Comtat-Venaissin were integrated along with the former principality of Orange to form the present department of Vaucluse with Avignon as its capital. This was confirmed on 19 February 1797 by the Treaty of Tolentino in which Article 5 definitively sanctioned the annexation stating that:\n\"The Pope renounces, purely and simply, all the rights to which he might lay claim over the city and territory of Avignon, and the Comtat Venaissin and its dependencies, and transfers and makes over the said rights to the French Republic.\"\nOn 1 October 1795 Alexandre Mottard de Lestang, a Knight, captured the town for the royalists with a troop of 10,000 men. The mission representative Boursault retook the city and had Lestang shot.\nBefore the French Revolution Avignon had as suffragan sees Carpentras, Vaison and Cavaillon, which were united by the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 to Avignon, together with the Diocese of Apt, a suffragan of Aix-en-Provence. However, at that same time Avignon was reduced to the rank of a bishopric and was made a suffragan see of Aix.\nOn 30 May 1814 the French annexation of Avignon was recognized by the Pope. Ercole Consalvi made an ineffectual protest at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 but Avignon was never restored to the Holy See. In 1815, Bonapartist Marshal Guillaume Marie Anne Brune was assassinated by adherents of the royalist party during the White Terror. The murder took place in the former Hotel du Palais Royal that was located Place Crillon in front of today's Hotel d'Europe.\nIn the years 1820-1830 Villeneuve was forced to yield part of its territory to Avignon: the part called the \u00cele de la Barthelasse.\nThe Archdiocese of Avignon was re-established in 1822, receiving as suffragan sees the Diocese of Viviers, Valence: (formerly under Lyon), N\u00eemes, and Montpellier (formerly under Toulouse).\nOn 18 October 1847 the Avignon - Marseille railway line was opened by the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Marseille \u00e0 Avignon (Marseille to Avignon Railway Company). In 1860 the current Avignon Centre railway station was built. In November 1898 the tramway network of the Compagnie des Tramways \u00c9lectriques d'Avignon (Electric Tramways Company of Avignon) was opened to replace the old company of horse-drawn transport.\nDuring the coup of 2 December 1851 the people of Avignon, with Alphonse Gent, tried to oppose it.In 1856 a major flood on the Durance river flooded Avignon.\n\n\n== From the beginning of the 20th century to today ==\n\nThe newly elected President of the Republic at the beginning of the year 1913, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, visited Provence in mid-October. He wrote in his book In the Service of France: Europe under arms: 1913, a description of his successive visits. The primary purpose of the visit was to verify in situ the state of mind of the F\u00e9librige in the likely event of a conflict with Germany. He met, at Maillane and at S\u00e9rignan-du-Comtat, the two most illustrious people Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral and Jean-Henri Fabre. Between these two appointments he paused at Avignon where he was received triumphantly at the Town Hall. Already the reception he had received at the Mas du Juge from the poet and the communal meal they had taken in the presidential train at Graveson had reassured him of the patriotism of Provence. It was, therefore in these terms that he spoke on the Nobel Prize in Literature:\n\"Dear and illustrious master, you who have pointed out imperishable monuments in honour of French land; you who have raised the prestige of a language and a literature that has a place in our national history to be proud of; you who, in glorifying Provence, have braided a crown of olive green; to you, august master, I bring the testimony of the recognition of the Republic and the great motherland\".\n\nThe 20th century saw significant development of urbanization, mainly outside the city walls, and several major projects have emerged. Between 1920 and 1975 the population has almost doubled despite the cession of Le Pontet in 1925 and the Second World War.\nOn the transport side 1937 saw the creation of the Avignon - Caumont Airport which became an airport in the early 1980s and became prominent with the opening of international routes, a new control tower, extension of the runway, etc.In September 1947 the first edition of the future Avignon Festival was held.\nAfter the Second World War on 11 November 1948 Avignon received a citation of the order of the division. This distinction involved the awarding of the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star. The city rose, expanded its festival, dusted off its monuments, and developed its tourism and trade.\nIn 1977 the city was awarded the Europe Prize, awarded by the Council of Europe.In 1996 the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e railway project was started. Its path passes through the commune and over the Rhone. From 1998 to 2001 the Avignon TGV station was built.In 2002, as part of the reshuffling of the ecclesiastic provinces of France, the Archdiocese of Avignon ceased to be a metropolitan and became, instead a suffragan diocese of the new province of Marseilles, while keeping its rank of archdiocese.\nOn 8 July 2008 waste containing unenriched uranium leaked into two rivers from Tricastin nuclear plant in southern France. Some 30,000 litres (7,925 gallons) of solution containing 12g of uranium per litre spilled from an overflowing reservoir at the facility \u2013 which handles liquids contaminated by uranium \u2013 into the ground and into the Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers. The authorities kept this a secret from the public for 12 hours then issued a statement prohibiting swimming and fishing in the Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers.A shooting occurred on July 2, 2017, near the Arrahma mosque in Avignon, Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, France. Eight people were injured during shooting. Two hooded gunmen arrived in a Renault Clio at the Arrahma mosque in Avignon at 22:30 CEST as worshippers were leaving the mosque. The gunmen opened fire with one carrying a shotgun and another a pistol. The gunmen were able to injure four people at the scene while a family of four in a nearby apartment received shrapnel wounds. A seven-year-old girl were among those injured. The authorities ruled out the possibility the attack was hate-related or a terrorist attack. An eyewitness claimed a 40 year old worshipper was targeted.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of Avignon\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "wiki": "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The work, part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, portrays five nude female prostitutes in a brothel on Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (translated into Spanish: Calle de Avi\u00f1\u00f3n), a street in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally feminine. The women appear slightly menacing and are rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. The figure on the left exhibits facial features and dress of Egyptian or southern Asian style. The two adjacent figures are shown in the Iberian style of Picasso's native Spain, while the two on the right are shown with African mask-like features. The racial primitivism evoked in these masks, according to Picasso, moved him to \"liberate an utterly original artistic style of compelling, even savage force.\"In this adaptation of primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. This proto-cubist work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art.\nLes Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial and led to widespread anger and disagreement, even amongst the painter's closest associates and friends. Matisse considered the work something of a bad joke yet indirectly reacted to it in his 1908 Bathers with a Turtle. Georges Braque too initially disliked the painting yet perhaps more than anyone else, studied the work in great detail. And in fact, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the cubist revolution. Its resemblance to C\u00e9zanne's The Bathers, Paul Gauguin's statue Oviri and El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal has been widely discussed by later critics.\nAt the time of its first exhibition in 1916, the painting was deemed immoral. The work, painted in Picasso's studio in the Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, Paris, was seen publicly for the first time at the Salon d'Antin in July 1916, at an exhibition organized by the poet Andr\u00e9 Salmon. It was at this exhibition that Salmon (who had previously titled the painting in 1912 Le bordel philosophique) renamed the work its current, less scandalous title, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, instead of the title originally chosen by Picasso, Le Bordel d'Avignon. Picasso, who always referred to it as mon bordel (\"my brothel\"), or Le Bordel d'Avignon, never liked Salmon's title and would have instead preferred the  bowdlerization Las chicas de Avignon (\"The Girls of Avignon\").\n\n\n== Background and development ==\n\nPicasso came into his own as an important artist during the first decade of the 20th century. He arrived in Paris from Spain around the turn of the century as a young, ambitious painter out to make a name for himself. Although he eventually left most of his friends, relatives and contacts in Spain, he continued to live and paint in Spain while making regular trips back to France. For several years he alternated between living and working in Barcelona, Madrid and the Spanish countryside, and made frequent trips to Paris.\nBy 1904, he was fully settled in Paris and had established several studios, important relationships with both friends and colleagues. Between 1901 and 1904, Picasso began to achieve recognition for his Blue period paintings. In the main these were studies of poverty and desperation based on scenes he had seen in Spain and Paris at the turn of the century. Subjects included gaunt families, blind figures, and personal encounters; other paintings depicted his friends, but most reflected and expressed a sense of blueness and despair.\n\nHe followed his success by developing into his Rose period from 1904 to 1907, which introduced a strong element of sensuality and sexuality into his work. The Rose period depictions of acrobats, circus performers and theatrical characters are rendered in warmer, brighter colors and are far more hopeful and joyful in their depictions of the bohemian life in the Parisian avant-garde and its environs. The Rose period produced two important large masterpieces: Family of Saltimbanques (1905), which recalls the work of Gustave Courbet (1819\u20131877) and \u00c9douard Manet (1832\u20131883); and Boy Leading a Horse (1905\u201306), which recalls C\u00e9zanne's Bather (1885\u20131887) and El Greco's Saint Martin and the Beggar (1597\u20131599). While he already had a considerable following by the middle of 1906, Picasso enjoyed further success with his paintings of massive oversized nude women, monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive (African, Micronesian, Native American) art. He began exhibiting his work in the galleries of Berthe Weill (1865\u20131951) and Ambroise Vollard (1866\u20131939), quickly gaining a growing reputation and a following amongst the artistic communities of Montmartre and Montparnasse.Picasso became a favorite of the American art collectors Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo around 1905. The Steins' older brother Michael and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew Allan Stein.Gertrude Stein began acquiring Picasso's drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal Salon at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905 he met Henri Matisse (1869\u20131954), who was to become in those days his chief rival, although in later years a close friend. The Steins introduced Picasso to Claribel Cone (1864\u20131929), and her sister Etta Cone (1870\u20131949), also American art collectors, who began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became important patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.\n\n\n== Rivalry with Matisse ==\n\nThe Salon d'Automne of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of Henri Matisse and the Les Fauves group. The latter gained their name after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their work with the phrase \"Donatello chez les fauves\" (\"Donatello among the wild beasts\"), contrasting the paintings with a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them. Henri Rousseau (1844\u20131910), an artist that Picasso knew and admired and who was not a Fauve, had his large jungle scene The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope also hanging near the works by Matisse and which may have had an influence on the particular sarcastic term used in the press. Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in the daily newspaper Gil Blas, and passed into popular usage.Although the pictures were widely derided\u2014\"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public\", declared the critic Camille Mauclair (1872\u20131945)\u2014they also attracted some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat; the purchase of this work by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work.\n\nMatisse's notoriety and preeminence as the leader of the new movement in modern painting continued to build throughout 1906 and 1907, and Matisse attracted a following of artists including Georges Braque (1880\u20131963), Andr\u00e9 Derain (1880\u20131954), Maurice de Vlaminck (1876\u20131958). Picasso's work had passed through his Blue period and his Rose period and while he had a considerable following his reputation was tame in comparison to his rival Matisse. The larger theme of Matisse's influential Le bonheur de vivre, an exploration of  \"The Golden Age\", evokes the historic \"Ages of Man\" theme and the potentials of a provocative new age that the twentieth century era offered. An equally bold, similarly themed painting titled The Golden Age, completed by Derain in 1905, shows the transfer of human ages in an even more direct way.To make matters worse Matisse and Derain shocked the French public again at the March 1907 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants when Matisse exhibited his painting Blue Nude, completed in early 1907 and Derain contributed,The Bathers, Both paintings completed in early 1907 and evoke ideas of human origins (world beginnings,  evolution) an increasingly important theme in Paris at this time. The Blue Nude was one of the paintings that would later create an international sensation at the Armory Show of 1913 in New York City.By October 1906 when Picasso began preparatory work for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, until its completion in March 1907, Picasso was vying with Matisse for the preeminent position of being the perceived new leader of Modern painting. Upon its completion the shock and the impact of the painting propelled Picasso into the center of controversy and all but knocked Matisse and Fauvism off the map, virtually ending the movement by the following year. In 1907 Picasso joined the art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1884\u20131979). Kahnweiler was a German art historian, art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He became prominent in Paris beginning in 1907 for being among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, and especially his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Before 1910 Picasso was already being recognized as one of the important leaders of Modern art alongside Henri Matisse who had been the undisputed leader of Fauvism and who was more than ten years older than he was and his contemporaries the Fauvist Andr\u00e9 Derain and the former Fauvist and fellow Cubist, Georges Braque.In his 1992 essay Reflections on Matisse, the art critic Hilton Kramer wrote,\n\nAfter the impact of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary. With the bizarre painting that appalled and electrified the cognoscenti, which understood the Les Demoiselles was at once a response to Matisse's Le bonheur de vivre (1905\u20131906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde wild beast\u2014a role that, as far as public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.\nKramer goes on to say,\n\nWhereas Matisse had drawn upon a long tradition of European painting\u2014from Giorgione, Poussin, and Watteau to Ingres, C\u00e9zanne, and Gauguin\u2014to create a modern version of a pastoral paradise in Le bonheur de vivre, Picasso had turned to an alien tradition of primitive art to create in Les Demoiselles a netherworld of strange gods and violent emotions. As between the mythological nymphs of Le bonheur de vivre and the grotesque effigies of Les Demoiselles, there was no question as to which was the more shocking or more intended to be shocking. Picasso had unleashed a vein of feeling that was to have immense consequences for the art and culture of the modern era while Matisse's ambition came to seem, as he said in his Notes of a Painter, more limited\u2014limited that is, to the realm of aesthetic pleasure. There was thus opened up, in the very first decade of the century and in the work of its two greatest artists, the chasm that has continued to divide the art of the modern era down to our own time.\nIt has been argued that the painting was a reaction to Henri Matisse's Le bonheur de vivre and Blue Nude.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nPicasso created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work, painted in Paris in the summer of 1907. He long acknowledged the importance of Spanish art and Iberian sculpture as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the art of Oceania, although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Picasso spent an October 1906 evening closely studying a Teke figure from Congo then owned by Matisse. It was later that night that Picasso's first studies for what would become Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon were created. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the Mus\u00e9e d'Ethnographie du Trocad\u00e9ro (known later as the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and sought inspiration from African and other arts shortly before completing Les Demoiselles. Picasso had come to this museum originally to study plaster casts of medieval sculptures, then also considered examples of \u201cprimitive\u201d art.\n\n\n=== El Greco ===\n\nIn 1907, when Picasso began to work on Les Demoiselles, one of the old master painters he greatly admired was El Greco (1541\u20131614). At the time El Greco was largely obscure and under-appreciated. Picasso's friend Ignacio Zuloaga (1870\u20131945) acquired El Greco's masterpiece, the Opening of the Fifth Seal, in 1897 for 1000 pesetas. While Picasso was working on Les Demoiselles, he visited his friend Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal. The relation between Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Opening of the Fifth Seal was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs and visually identifying qualities of both works were analyzed.El Greco's painting, which Picasso studied repeatedly in Zuloaga's house, inspired not only the size, format, and composition of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, but it inspired its apocalyptic power. Later, speaking of the work to Dor de la Souch\u00e8re in Antibes, Picasso said: \"In any case, only the execution counts. From this point of view, it is correct to say that Cubism has a Spanish origin and that I invented Cubism. We must look for the Spanish influence in C\u00e9zanne. Things themselves necessitate it, the influence of El Greco, a Venetian painter, on him. But his structure is Cubist.\"The relationship of the painting to other group portraits in the Western tradition, such as Diana and Callisto by Titian (1488\u20131576), and the same subject by Rubens (1577\u20131640), in the Prado, has also been discussed.\n\n\n=== C\u00e9zanne and Cubism ===\n\nBoth Paul Gauguin (1848\u20131903) and Paul C\u00e9zanne (1839\u20131906) were accorded major posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris between 1903 and 1907, and both were important influences on Picasso and instrumental to his creation of Les Demoiselles. According to the English art historian, collector and author of The Cubist Epoch, Douglas Cooper, both of those artists were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907. Cooper goes on to say however Les Demoiselles is often erroneously referred to as the first Cubist painting. He explains,\n\nThe Demoiselles is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the Demoiselles is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.\nAlthough not well known to the general public prior to 1906, C\u00e9zanne's reputation was highly regarded in avant-garde circles, as evidenced by Ambroise Vollard's interest in showing and collecting his work, and by Leo Stein's interest. Picasso was familiar with much of C\u00e9zanne's work that he saw at Vollard's gallery and at the Stein's. After C\u00e9zanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in a large scale museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 C\u00e9zanne retrospective at the Salon d'Automne greatly impacted the direction that the avant-garde in Paris took, lending credence to his position as one of the most influential artists of the 19th century and to the advent of Cubism. The 1907 C\u00e9zanne exhibition was enormously influential in establishing C\u00e9zanne as an important painter whose ideas were particularly resonant especially to young artists in Paris.Both Picasso and Braque found the inspiration for their proto-Cubist works in Paul C\u00e9zanne, who said to observe and learn to see and treat nature as if it were composed of basic shapes like cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones. C\u00e9zanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Gris and others to experiment with ever more complex multiple views of the same subject, and, eventually to the fracturing of form. C\u00e9zanne thus sparked one of the most revolutionary areas of artistic enquiry of the 20th century, one which was to affect profoundly the development of modern art.\n\n\n=== Gauguin and Primitivism ===\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the European cultural elite were discovering African, Oceanic and Native American art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those cultures. Around 1906, Picasso, Matisse, Derain and other artists in Paris had acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and tribal masks, in part because of the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that had suddenly achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 had a stunning and powerful influence on Picasso's paintings.In the autumn of 1906, Picasso followed his previous successes with paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Pablo Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting and his writing as well. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to Les Demoiselles in 1907.According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Pablo Picasso as early as 1902 became an aficionado of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio, in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces and gave Picasso a first La Plume edition of Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian John Richardson wrote,\n\nThe 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art\u2014not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides\u2014could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor.\nBoth David Sweetman and John Richardson point to Gauguin's Oviri (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on Les Demoiselles. Sweetman writes,\n\nGauguin's statue Oviri, which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.\nAccording to Richardson,\n\nPicasso's interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome Oviri. Until 1987, when the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the Demoiselles. Although just under 30 inches high, Oviri has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by Oviri. 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his Cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism.\n\n\n=== African and Iberian art ===\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Europe's colonization of Africa led to many economic, social, political, and even artistic encounters. From these encounters, Western visual artists became increasingly interested in the unique forms of African art, particularly masks from the Niger-Congo region. In an essay by Dennis Duerden, author of African Art (1968), The Invisible Present (1972), and a former director of the BBC World Service, the mask is defined as \"very often a complete head-dress and not just that part that conceals the face\". This form of visual art and image appealed to Western visual artists, leading to what Duerden calls the \"discovery\" of African art by Western practitioners, including Picasso.\n\nThe stylistic sources for the heads of the women and their degree of influence has been much discussed and debated, in particular the influence of African tribal masks, art of Oceania, and pre-Roman Iberian sculptures. The rounded contours of the features of the three women to the left can be related to Iberian sculpture, but not obviously the fragmented planes of the two on the right, which indeed seem influenced by African masks. Lawrence Weschler says that, in many ways, much of the moldering cultural and even scientific ferment that characterized the first decade and a half of the twentieth century and that laid the foundations for much of what we today consider modern can be traced back to ways in which Europe was already wrestling with its bad-faith, often strenuously repressed, knowledge of what it had been doing in Africa. The example of Picasso virtually launching cubism with his 1907 Desmoiselles d\u2019Avignon, in response to the sorts of African masks and other colonial booty he was encountering in Paris\u2019s Musee de l\u2019Homme, is obvious.\n\nPrivate collections and illustrated books featuring African art in this period were also important. While Picasso emphatically denied the influence of African masks on the painting: \"African art? Never heard of it!\" (L'art n\u00e8gre? Connais pas!), this is belied by his deep interest in the African sculptures owned by Matisse and his close friend Guiliaume Apollinaire. Since none of the African masks once thought to have influenced Picasso in this painting were available in Paris at the time work was painted, he is thought now to have studied African mask forms in an illustrated volume by anthropologist Leo Frobenius.   Primitivism continues  in his work during, before and after the painting of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, from spring 1906 through the spring of 1907. Influences from ancient Iberian sculpture are also important. Some Iberian reliefs from Osuna, then only recently excavated, were on display in the Louvre from 1904. Archaic Greek sculpture has also been claimed as an influence.\nThe influence of African sculpture became an issue in 1939, when Alfred Barr claimed that the primitivism of the Demoiselles derived from the art of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and the French Congo. Picasso insisted that the editor of his catalogue raissonne, Christian Zervos, publish a disclaimer: the Demoiselles, he said, owed nothing to African art, everything to the reliefs from Osuna that he had seen in the Louvre a year or so before. Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero with Andre Malraux in March 1907, about which he later said \"When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. The flea market, the smell. I was all alone. I wanted to get away, but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was happening to me, right. The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things.\" Maurice de Vlaminck is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of Fang extraction in 1904.Picasso biographer John Richardson recounts in A Life of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907\u20131916, art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's recollection of his first visit to Picasso's studio in July 1907. Kahnweiler remembers seeing \"dusty stacks of canvases\" in Picasso's studio and \"African sculptures of majestic severity\". Richardson comments: \"so much for Picasso's story that he was not yet aware of Tribal art.'\" A photograph of Picasso in his studio surrounded by African sculptures c.1908, is found on page 27 of that same volume.Suzanne Preston Blier says that, like Gauguin and several other artists in this era, Picasso used illustrated books for many of his preliminary studies for this painting. In addition to the Frobenius book, his sources included a 1906 publication of a twelfth-century Medieval art manuscript on architectural sculpture by Villiard de Honnecourt and a book by Carl Heinrich Stratz of pseudo-pornography showing photos and drawings of women from around the world organized to evoke ideas of human origins and evolution. Blier suggests that this helps account for the diversity of styles Picasso employed in his image-filled sketchbooks for this painting. These books, and other sources such as cartoons, Blier writes, also offer hints as to the larger meaning of this painting.\n\n\n=== Mathematics ===\n\nMaurice Princet, a French mathematician and actuary, played a role in the birth of Cubism as an associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Juan Gris and later Marcel Duchamp. Princet became known as \"le math\u00e9maticien du cubisme\" (\"the mathematician of cubism\").Princet is credited with introducing the work of Henri Poincar\u00e9 and the concept of the \"fourth dimension\" to artists at the Bateau-Lavoir. Princet brought to the attention of Picasso, Metzinger and others, a book by Esprit Jouffret, Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie \u00e0 quatre dimensions (Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions, 1903), a popularization of Poincar\u00e9's Science and Hypothesis in which Jouffret described hypercubes and other complex polyhedra in four dimensions and projected them onto the two-dimensional surface. Picasso's sketchbooks for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon illustrate Jouffret's influence on the artist's work.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nAlthough Les Demoiselles had an enormous and profound influence on modern art, its impact was not immediate, and the painting stayed in Picasso's studio for many years. At first, only Picasso's intimate circle of artists, dealers, collectors and friends were aware of the work. While many were shocked and some outraged, influential people such as Georges Braque and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler were supportive. Soon after the late summer of 1907, Picasso and his long-time lover Fernande Olivier (1881\u20131966) had a parting of the ways. The re-painting of the two heads on the far right of Les Demoiselles fueled speculation that it was an indication of the split between Picasso and Olivier. Although they later reunited for a period, the relationship ended in 1912.A photograph of the Les Demoiselles was first published in an article by Gelett Burgess entitled \"The Wild Men of Paris, Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves\", The Architectural Record, May 1910.Les Demoiselles would not be exhibited until 1916, and not widely recognized as a revolutionary achievement until the early 1920s, when Andr\u00e9 Breton (1896\u20131966) published the work. The painting was reproduced again in Cahiers d'art (1927), within an article dedicated to African art.Richardson goes on to say that Henri Matisse was fighting mad upon seeing the Demoiselles at Picasso's studio. He let it be known that he regarded the painting as an attempt to ridicule the modern movement; he was outraged to find his sensational Blue Nude, not to speak of Bonheur de vivre, overtaken by Picasso's \"hideous\" whores. He vowed to get even and make Picasso beg for mercy. Just as the Bonheur de vivre had fueled Picasso's competitiveness, Les Demoiselles now fueled Matisse's.Among Picasso's closed circle of friends and colleagues there was a mixture of opinions about Les Demoiselles. Georges Braque and Andr\u00e9 Derain were both initially troubled by it although they were supportive of Picasso. According to William Rubin, two of Picasso's friends, the art critic Andr\u00e9 Salmon and the painter Ardengo Soffici (1879\u20131964), were enthusiastic about it while Guillaume Apollinaire (1880\u20131918) wasn't. Both the art dealer-collector Wilhelm Uhde (1874\u20131947), and art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler were more enthusiastic about the painting however.According to Kahnweiler Les Demoiselles was the beginning of Cubism. He writes:\n\nEarly in 1907 Picasso began a strange large painting depicting women, fruit and drapery, which he left unfinished. It cannot be called other than unfinished, even though it represents a long period of work. Begun in the spirit of the works of 1906, it contains in one section the endeavors of 1907 and thus never constitutes a unified whole.\nThe nudes, with large, quiet eyes, stand rigid, like mannequins. Their stiff, round bodies are flesh-colored, black and white. That is the style of 1906.\n\nIn the foreground, however, alien to the style of the rest of the painting, appear a crouching figure and a bowl of fruit. These forms are drawn angularly, not roundly modeled in chiaroscuro. The colors are luscious blue, strident yellow, next to pure black and white. This is the beginning of Cubism, the first upsurge, a desperate titanic clash with all of the problems at once.\n\n\n== Public view and title ==\nFrom 16 to 31 July 1916 Les Demoiselles was exhibited to the public for the first time at the Salon d'Antin, an exhibition organized by Andr\u00e9 Salmon titled L'Art moderne en France. The exhibition space at 26 rue d'Antin was lent by the famous couturier and art collector Paul Poiret. The larger Salon d'Automne and Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants had been closed due to World War I, making this the only Cubists' exhibition in France since 1914. On 23 July 1916 a review was published in Le Cri de Paris:\nThe Cubists are not waiting for the war to end to recommence hostilities against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all four corners of the canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.\nPicasso referred to his only entry at the Salon d'Antin as his Brothel painting calling it Le Bordel d'Avignon but Andr\u00e9 Salmon who had originally labeled the work, Le Bordel Philosophique, retitled it Les Demoiselles d'Avignon so as to lessen its scandalous impact on the public. Picasso never liked the title, however, preferring \"las chicas de Avignon\", but Salmon's title stuck. Leo Steinberg labels his essays on the painting after its original title. According to Suzanne Preston Blier, the word bordel in the painting's title, rather than evoking a house of prostitution (un maison clos) instead more accurately references in French a complex situation or mess, This painting, Blier says, explores not prostitution per se, but instead sex and motherhood more generally, along with the complexities of evolution in the colonial multi-racial world. The name Avignon, scholars argue, not only references the street where Picasso once bought his paint supplies (which had a few brothels), but also the home of Max Jacob's grandmother, whom Picasso jocularly identifies as one of the painting's diverse modern day. subjects.The only other time the painting might have been exhibited to the public prior to a 1937 showing in New York was in 1918, in an exhibition dedicated to Picasso and Matisse at Galerie Paul Guillaume in Paris, though very little information exists about this exhibition or the presence (if at all) of Les Demoiselles.Afterwards, the painting was rolled up and remained with Picasso until 1924 when, with urging and help from Breton and Louis Aragon (1897\u20131982), he sold it to designer Jacques Doucet (1853\u20131929), for 25,000 francs.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\nPicasso drew each of the figures in Les Demoiselles differently. The woman pulling the curtain on the upper right is rendered with heavy paint. Composed of sharp geometric shapes, her head is the most strictly Cubist of all five. The curtain seems to blend partially into her body. The Cubist head of the crouching figure (lower right) underwent at least two revisions from an Iberian figure to its current state. She also seems to have been drawn from two different perspectives at once, creating a confusing, twisted figure. The woman above her is rather manly, with a dark face and square chest. The whole picture is in a two-dimensional style, with an abandoned perspective.\n\nMuch of the critical debate that has taken place over the years centers on attempting to account for this multiplicity of styles within the work. The dominant understanding for over five decades, espoused most notably by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist, has been that it can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso's art, an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism, the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years. Suzanne Preston Blier says that the divergent styles of the painting were added intentionally to convey to each women art \u201cstyle\u201d attributes from the five geographic areas each woman represents.Art critic John Berger, in his controversial 1965 biography The Success and Failure of Picasso, interprets Les Demoiselles d'Avignon as the provocation that led to Cubism:\n\nBlunted by the insolence of so much recent art, we probably tend to underestimate the brutality of the Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. All his friends who saw it in his studio were at first shocked by it. And it was meant to shock\u2026\nA brothel may not in itself be shocking. But women painted without charm or sadness, without irony or social comment, women painted like the palings of a stockade through eyes that look out as if at death \u2013 that is shocking. And equally the method of painting. Picasso himself has said that he was influenced at the time by archaic Spanish (Iberian) sculpture. He was also influenced \u2013 particularly in the two heads at the right \u2013 by African masks\u2026here it seems that Picasso's quotations are simple, direct, and emotional. He is not in the least concerned with formal problems. The dislocations in this picture are the result of aggression, not aesthetics; it is the nearest you can get in a painting to an outrage\u2026\nI emphasize the violent and iconoclastic aspect of this painting because it is usually enshrined as the great formal exercise which was the starting point of Cubism. It was the starting point of Cubism, in so far as it prompted Braque to begin painting at the end of the year his own far more formal answer to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\u2026yet if he had been left to himself, this picture would never have led Picasso to Cubism or to any way of painting remotely resembling it\u2026It has nothing to do with that twentieth-century vision of the future which was the essence of Cubism.\nYet it did provoke the beginning of the great period of exception in Picasso's life. Nobody can know exactly how the change began inside Picasso. We can only note the results. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, unlike any previous painting by Picasso, offers no evidence of skill. On the contrary, it is clumsy, overworked, unfinished. It is as though his fury in painting it was so great that it destroyed his gifts\u2026\n\nBy painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon Picasso provoked Cubism. It was the spontaneous and, as always, primitive insurrection out of which, for good historical reasons, the revolution of Cubism developed.\nIn 1972, art critic Leo Steinberg in his essay The Philosophical Brothel posited a wholly different explanation for the wide range of stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches\u2014which had been ignored by most critics\u2014he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the gaze of the viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.The earliest sketches feature two men inside the brothel; a sailor and a medical student (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a memento mori, a reminder of death). A trace of their presence at a table in the center remains: the jutting edge of a table near the bottom of the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg says, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the \"trauma of the gaze\" (to use a phrase of Rosalind Krauss's invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.According to Steinberg, the reversed gaze, that is, the fact that the figures look directly at the viewer, as well as the idea of the self-possessed woman, no longer there solely for the pleasure of the male gaze, may be traced back to Manet's Olympia of 1863. William Rubin (1927\u20132006), the former Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA wrote that \"Steinberg was the first writer to come to grips with the sexual subject of the Demoiselles.\"A few years after writing The Philosophical Brothel, Steinberg wrote further about the revolutionary nature of Les Demoiselles:\n\nPicasso was resolved to undo the continuities of form and field which Western art had so long taken for granted. The famous stylistic rupture at right turned out to be merely a consummation. Overnight, the contrived coherences of representational art - the feigned unities of time and place, the stylistic consistencies - all were declared to be fictional. The Demoiselles confessed itself a picture conceived in duration and delivered in spasms. In this one work Picasso discovered that the demands of discontinuity could be met on multiple levels: by cleaving depicted flesh; by elision of limbs and abbreviation; by slashing the web of connecting space; by abrupt changes of vantage; and by a sudden stylistic shift at the climax. Finally, the insistent staccato of the presentation was found to intensify the picture's address and symbolic charge: the beholder, instead of observing a roomfuI of lazing whores, is targeted from all sides. So far from suppressing the subject, the mode of organization heightens its flagrant eroticism.\nAt the end of the first volume of his (so far) three volume Picasso biography: A Life Of Picasso. The Prodigy, 1881\u20131906, John Richardson comments on Les Demoiselles. Richardson says:\n\nIt is at this point, the beginning of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of Dionysiac Demoiselles on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the Demoiselles is rooted in Picasso's past, not to speak of such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and C\u00e9zanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.\nSuzanne Preston Blier addresses the history and meaning of Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon in a 2019 book in a different way, one that draws on her African art expertise and an array of newly discovered sources she unearthed. Blier addresses the painting not as a simple bordello scene but as Picasso's interpretation of the diversity of women from around the world that Picasso encountered in part through photographs and sculptures seen in illustrated books. These representations, Blier argues, are central to understanding the painting's creation and help identify the demoiselles as global figures \u2013 mothers, grandmothers, lovers, and sisters, living the colonial world Picasso inhabited. She says that Picasso has reunited these diverse women together in this strange cave-like (and womb-resembling) setting as a kind of global \"time machine\" \u2013 each woman referencing a different era, place of origins, and concomitant artistic style, as part of the  broader ages of man them important to the new century, in which core themes of evolution took on an increasingly important role. The two men (a sailor and a doctor) depicted in some of the painting's earlier preparatory drawings, Blier suggests, likely represent the male authors of two of the illustrated books that Picasso employed \u2013 the anthropologist Leo Frobenius as sailor, one travels the world to. explore various ports of call and the Vienna medical doctor, Karl Heinrich Stratz who holds a human skull or book consistent with the detailed anatomical studies that he provides.Blier is able to date the painting to late March 1907 directly following the opening of the Salon des Independents where Matisse and Derain had exhibited their own bold, emotionally charged \"origins\"-themed tableaux. The large scale of the canvas, Blier says, complements the important scientific and historical theme. The reunion of the mothers of each \"race\" within this human evolutionary framework, Blier maintains, also constitutes the larger \"philosophy\" behind the painting's original le bordel philosophique title \u2013 evoking the potent \"mess\" and \"complex situation\" (le bordel) that Picasso was exploring in this work. In contrast to Leo Steinberg and William Rubin who argued that Picasso had effaced the two right hand demoiselles to repaint their faces with African masks in response to a crisis stemming from larger fears of death or women, an early photograph of the painting in Picasso's studio, Blier shows, indicates that the artist had portrayed African masks on these women from the outset consistent with their identities as progenitors of these races. Blier argues that the painting was largely completed in a single night following a debate about philosophy with friends at a local Paris brasserie.\n\n\n== Purchase ==\n\nJacques Doucet had seen the painting at the Salon d'Antin, yet remarkably seems to have purchased Les Demoiselles without asking Picasso to unroll it in his studio so that he could see it again. Andr\u00e9 Breton later described the transaction:\n\nI remember the day he bought the painting from Picasso, who strange as it may seem, appeared to be intimidated by Doucet and even offered no resistance when the price was set at 25,000 francs: \"Well then, it's agreed, M. Picasso.\" Doucet then said: \"You shall receive 2,000 francs per month, beginning next month, until the sum of 25,000 francs is reached.\nJohn Richardson quotes Breton in a letter to Doucet about Les Demoiselles writing:\n\n through it one penetrates right into the core of Picasso's laboratory and because it is the crux of the drama, the center of all the conflicts that Picasso has given rise to and that will last forever....It is a work which to my mind transcends painting; it is the theater of everything that has happened in the last 50 years.\nUltimately, it seems Doucet paid 30,000 francs rather than the agreed price. A few months after the purchase Doucet had the painting appraised at between 250,000 and 300,000 francs. Richardson speculates that Picasso, who by 1924 was on the top of the art world and didn't need to sell the painting to Doucet, did so and at that low price because Doucet promised Les Demoiselles would go to the Louvre in his will. However, after Doucet died in 1929 he did not leave the painting to the Louvre in his will, and it was sold like most of Doucet's collection through private dealers.In November 1937 the Jacques Seligman & Co. art gallery in New York City held an exhibition titled \"20 Years in the Evolution of Picasso, 1903\u20131923\" that included Les Demoiselles. The Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting for $24,000. The museum raised $18,000 toward the purchase price by selling a Degas painting and the rest came from donations from the co-owners of the gallery Germain Seligman and Cesar de Hauke.The Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted an important Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940. The exhibition entitled: Picasso:40 Years of His Art, was organized by Alfred H. Barr (1902\u20131981), in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibition contained 344 works, including the major and then newly painted Guernica and its studies, as well as Les Demoiselles.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn July 2007, Newsweek published a two-page article about Les Demoiselles d'Avignon describing it as the \"most influential work of art of the last 100 years\". Art critic Holland Cotter argued that Picasso \"changed history with this work. He'd replaced the benign ideal of the Classical nude with a new race of sexually armed and dangerous beings.\"The painting is prominently featured in the 2018 season of the television series Genius which focuses on Picasso's life and work.\n\n\n== Painting materials ==\nIn 2003, an examination of the painting by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy performed by conservators at the Museum of Modern Art confirmed the presence of the following pigments: lead white, bone black, vermilion, cadmium yellow, cobalt blue, emerald green, and native earth pigments (such as brown ochre) that contain iron.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLes Demoiselles d'Avignon in the MoMA Online Collection\nLes Demoiselles d'Avignon Conserving A Modern Masterpiece\nJulia Frey, Anatomy of a Masterpiece, New York Times Review of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon By William Rubin, Helene Seckel and Judith Cousins\nGelett Burgess, The Wild Men of Paris, Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves, 1910 (PDF)\nPablo Picasso, 1907, Five Nudes (Study for \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\"), watercolor on wove paper, 17.5 x 22.5 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art",

In 1309 it was selected as the papal residence by Clement V. The city was chosen, in part, because it was more centrally located within Christendom than Rome. Moreover, the situation in central Italy was unsettled and French influence on the papal court had grown during the 13th century. In 1348 Avignon was bought by Clement VI, the fourth of seven Avignon popes, from Queen Joan of Provence, and the papal presence in the city, which remained papal property until the French Revolution, expanded significantly from that point. Despite repeated calls by St. Catherine of Siena and others for the popes to return to Rome, Avignon remained the sole capital of the church until 1377 and remained one of the residences of the papacy during the Great Schism (1378\u20131417), when popes ruled in Avignon and Rome.The city was especially detested by Italians of the papal court in Avignon. Even though he served the pope, Petrarch, who first referred to Avignon as Babylon, described it as where the winter mistral winds blow bitterly, \u201ca sewer where all the muck of the universe collects.\u201d The city and the papacy in the 14th century have a notorious reputation. Few of the holders of the papal throne are noted for their piety, and even the best of them were more concerned with legal and financial matters than with their pastoral responsibilities. They were accused of venality, nepotism, and corruption and were regarded as puppets of the French kings. The papal territory suffered the depredations of the routiers (private armies that lived by pillage between mercenary engagements during the Hundred Years\u2019 War). The city, like much of the rest of Europe, also suffered from frequent outbreaks of the plague. The actions of Pope Clement VI, who protected the Jews from suffering a pogrom during the plague, however, undermine the traditional depictions of the period. Indeed, it is easy to exaggerate the flaws of the city and its popes, who were able administrators and quite learned; their poor reputation stems, in part, from the polemic involved in the demand for the return to Rome.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nPapal legates continued to govern Avignon until 1791, when it was annexed by the French National Assembly. In its seizure, there was bloodshed and the interior of the Palais des Papes (Popes\u2019 Palace) was wrecked. The palace, a formidable eight-towered fortress on a rock 190 feet (58 metres) above Avignon, was used as a barracks from 1822 to 1906.One of the largest ch\u00e2teaux-forts still standing, the Popes\u2019 Palace is really two buildings. The Palais Vieux (Old Palace; 1334\u201342), built by Benedict XII, is austere, while the Palais Nouveau (New Palace; 1342\u201352), erected under Clement VI, is rich with architectural devices and embellishment. There are numerous small chapels and three large chapels decorated with 14th-century frescoes. Alongside the palace is the Romanesque cathedral (12th century) of Notre-Dame-des-Doms, burial place of two of the popes. In the town below there are 16th- and 17th-century houses and six churches dating from the 14th to the 17th century. Two of these are chapels of p\u00e9nitents noirs, lay groups of 14th-century flagellants who marched hooded and barefoot through the streets and whose membership included kings of France. The ramparts built by the popes still gird the town, 3 miles (5 km) in circuit, with machicolated battlements (projecting turrets), towers, and gates.Four arches of the famed Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet bridge (of the song \u201cSur le pont d\u2019Avignon\u201d) still reach out from the town, its Romanesque St. Nicholas Chapel still perched on the second pier. The Rh\u00f4ne currents had defied bridging until St. B\u00e9n\u00e9zet and his disciples built the bridge in the late 12th century. Broken several times, it was abandoned in 1680.

        "wiki": "The Pont du Gard is an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge built in the first century AD to carry water over 50 km (31 mi) to the Roman colony of Nemausus (N\u00eemes). It crosses the river Gardon near the town of Vers-Pont-du-Gard in southern France. The Pont du Gard is the highest of all Roman aqueduct bridges, and one of the best preserved. It was added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1985 because of its historical importance.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge has three tiers of arches, stands 48.8 m (160 ft) high, and descends a mere 2.5 centimetres (1 in) \u2013 a gradient of only 1 in 18,241 \u2013 while the whole aqueduct descends in height by only 12.6 m (41 ft) over its entire length, indicative of the great precision that Roman engineers were able to achieve using simple technology. \nThe aqueduct formerly carried an estimated 40,000 m3 (8,800,000 imp gal) of water a day to the fountains, baths and homes of the citizens of N\u00eemes. It may have been in use as late as the 6th century, with some parts used for significantly longer, but a lack of maintenance after the 4th century led to clogging by mineral deposits and debris that eventually stopped the flow of water.\nAfter the Roman Empire collapsed and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact due to the importance of its secondary function as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river. Over time, some of its stone blocks were looted, and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination. It underwent a series of renovations between the 18th and 21st centuries, commissioned by the local authorities and the French state, which culminated in 2000 with the opening of a new visitor centre and the removal of traffic and buildings from the bridge and the area immediately around it. Today it is one of France's most popular tourist attractions, and has attracted the attention of a succession of literary and artistic visitors.\n\n\n=== Route of the N\u00eemes aqueduct ===\n\nThe location of Nemausus (N\u00eemes) was somewhat inconvenient when it came to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uz\u00e8s), where there are natural springs.The N\u00eemes aqueduct was built to channel water from the springs of the Fontaine d'Eure near Uz\u00e8s to the castellum divisorum (repartition basin) in Nemausus. From there, it was distributed to fountains, baths and private homes around the city. The straight-line distance between the two is only about 20 km (12 mi), but the aqueduct takes a winding route measuring around 50 km (31 mi). This was necessary to circumvent the southernmost foothills of the Massif Central, known as the Garrigues de N\u00eemes. They are difficult to cross, as they are covered in dense vegetation and garrigue and indented by deep valleys. It was impractical for the Romans to attempt to tunnel through the hills, as it would have required a tunnel of between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6 mi), depending on the starting point. A roughly V-shaped course around the eastern end of the Garrigues de N\u00eemes was therefore the only practical way of transporting the water from the spring to the city.\nThe Fontaine d'Eure, at 76 m (249 ft) above sea level, is only 17 m (56 ft) higher than the repartition basin in N\u00eemes, but this provided a sufficient gradient to sustain a steady flow of water to the 50,000 inhabitants of the Roman city. The aqueduct's average gradient is only 1 in 3,000. It varies widely along its course, but is as little as 1 in 20,000 in some sections. The Pont du Gard itself descends 2.5 cm (0.98 in) in 456 m (1,496 ft), a gradient of 1 in 18,241. The average gradient between the start and end of the aqueduct is far shallower than was usual for Roman aqueducts \u2013 only about a tenth of the average gradient of some of the aqueducts in Rome.\n\nThe reason for the disparity in gradients along the aqueduct's route is that a uniform gradient would have meant that the Pont du Gard would have been infeasibly high, given the limitations of the technology of the time. By varying the gradient along the route, the aqueduct's engineers were able to lower the height of the bridge by 6 metres (20 ft) to 48.77 metres (160.0 ft) above the river \u2013 still exceptionally high by Roman standards, but within acceptable limits. This height limit governed the profile and gradients of the entire aqueduct, but it came at the price of creating a \"sag\" in the middle of the aqueduct. The gradient profile before the Pont du Gard is relatively steep, descending at 0.67 metres (2 ft 2 in) per kilometre, but thereafter it descends by only 6 metres (20 ft) over the remaining 25 kilometres (16 mi). In one section, the winding route between the Pont du Gard and St Bonnet required an extraordinary degree of accuracy from the Roman engineers, who had to allow for a fall of only 7 millimetres (0.28 in) per 100 metres (330 ft) of the conduit.\n\nIt is estimated that the aqueduct supplied the city with around 40,000 cubic metres (8,800,000 imp gal) of water a day that took nearly 27 hours to flow from the source to the city. The water arrived in the castellum divisorum at N\u00eemes \u2013 an open, shallow, circular basin 5.5 m in diameter by 1 m deep. It would have been surrounded by a balustrade within some sort of enclosure, probably under some kind of small but elaborate pavilion. When it was excavated, traces of a tiled roof, Corinthian columns and a fresco decorated with fish and dolphins were discovered in a fragmentary condition. The aqueduct water entered through an opening 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) wide, and ten large holes in the facing wall, each 40 centimetres (16 in) wide, directed the water into the city's main water pipes. Three large drains were also located in the floor, possibly to enable the nearby amphitheatre to be flooded rapidly to enable naumachia (mock naval battles) to be held.The spring still exists and is now the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in dissolved calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.Much of the N\u00eemes aqueduct was built underground, as was typical of Roman aqueducts. It was constructed by digging a trench in which a stone channel was built and enclosed by an arched roof of stone slabs, which was then covered with earth. Some sections of the channel are tunnelled through solid rock. In all, 35 km (22 mi) of the aqueduct was constructed below the ground. The remainder had to be carried on the surface through conduits set on a wall or on arched bridges. Some substantial remains of the above-ground works can still be seen today, such as the so-called \"Pont Rue\" that stretches for hundreds of metres around Vers and still stands up to 7.5 m (25 ft) high. Other surviving parts include the Pont de Born\u00e8gre, three arches carrying the aqueduct 17 m (56 ft) across a stream; the Pont de Sartanette, near the Pont du Gard, which covers 32 m (105 ft) across a small valley; and three sections of aqueduct tunnel near Sernhac, measuring up to 66 m (217 ft) long. However, the Pont du Gard is by far the best preserved section of the entire aqueduct.\n\n\n=== Description of the bridge ===\n Built on three levels, the Pont is 49 m (161 ft) high above the river at low water and 274 m (899 ft) long. Its width varies from 9 m (30 ft) at the bottom to 3 m (9.8 ft) at the top. The three levels of arches are recessed, with the main piers in line one above another. The span of the arches varies slightly, as each was constructed independently to provide flexibility to protect against subsidence. Each level has a differing number of arches:\n\nThe first level of the Pont du Gard adjoins a road bridge that was added in the 18th century. The water conduit or specus, which is about 1.8 m (6 ft) high and 1.2 m (4 ft) wide, is carried at the top of the third level. The upper levels of the bridge are slightly curved in the upstream direction. It was long believed that the engineers had designed it this way deliberately to strengthen the bridge's structure against the flow of water, like a dam wall. However, a microtopographic survey carried out in 1989 showed that the bend is caused by the stone expanding and contracting by about 5 mm (0.20 in) a day under the heat of the sun. Over the centuries, this process has produced the current deformation.The Pont du Gard was constructed largely without the use of mortar or clamps. It contains an estimated 50,400 tons of limestone with a volume of some 21,000 m3 (740,000 cu ft); some of the individual blocks weigh up to 6 tons. Most of the stone was extracted from the local quarry of Estel located approximately 700 metres (2,300 ft) downstream, on the banks of the Gardon River. The coarse-grained soft reddish shelly limestone, known locally as \"Pierre de Vers\", lends itself very well to dimension stone production. The blocks were precisely cut to fit perfectly together by friction and gravity, eliminating the need for mortar. The builders also left inscriptions on the stonework conveying various messages and instructions. Many blocks were numbered and inscribed with the required locations, such as fronte dextra or fronte sinistra (front right or front left), to guide the builders.The method of construction is fairly well understood by historians. The patron of the aqueduct \u2013 a rich individual or the city of N\u00eemes itself \u2013 would have hired a large team of contractors and skilled labourers. A surveyor or mensor planned the route using a groma for sighting, the chorobates for levelling, and a set of measuring poles five or ten Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on wax tablets, later to be written up on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the water conduit was constructed.The builders would have made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work could have been done using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; \u00c9mile Esp\u00e9randieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.\n\nAlthough the exterior of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.Although the Pont du Gard is renowned for its appearance, its design is not optimal as the technique of stacking arches on top of each other is clumsy and inefficient (and therefore expensive) in the amount of materials it requires. Later aqueducts had a more sophisticated design, making greater use of concrete to reduce their volume and cost of construction. The Aqueduct bridge of Segovia and the Pont de les Ferreres are of roughly similar length but use far fewer arches. Roman architects were eventually able to do away with \"stacking\" altogether. The Acueducto de los Milagros in M\u00e9rida, Spain and the Chabet Ilelouine aqueduct bridge, near Cherchell, Algeria  utilise tall, slender piers, constructed from top to bottom with concrete-faced masonry and brick.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of the aqueduct has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus' son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Esp\u00e9randieu, writing in 1926, linked the construction of the aqueduct with Agrippa's visit to Narbonensis in that year. Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the N\u00eemes aqueduct, and coins discovered in the outflow in N\u00eemes are no older than the reign of the emperor Claudius (41\u201354 AD). On this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the aqueduct must have been completed around the middle of the 1st century AD. It is believed to have taken about fifteen years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.From the 4th century onwards, the aqueduct's maintenance was neglected as successive waves of invaders disrupted the region. It became clogged with debris, encrustations and plant roots, greatly reducing the flow of the water. The resulting deposits in the conduit, consisting of layers of dirt and organic material, are up to 50 cm (20 in) thick on each wall. An analysis of the deposits originally suggested that it had continued to supply water to N\u00eemes until as late as the 9th century, but more recent investigations suggest that it had gone out of use by about the sixth century, though parts of it may have continued to be used for significantly longer.\n\nAlthough some of its stones were plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge across the valley. In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uz\u00e8s the right to levy tolls on those using the bridge. The right later passed to the Bishops of Uz\u00e8s. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the bridge in good repair. However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the bridge, the duke had one side of the second row of arches cut away to a depth of about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide enough to accommodate carts and cannons, but severely weakened the bridge in the process.In 1703 the local authorities renovated the Pont du Gard to repair cracks, fill in ruts and replace the stones lost in the previous century. A new bridge was built by the engineer Henri Pitot in 1743\u201347 next to the arches of the lower level, so that the road traffic could cross on a purpose-built bridge. The novelist Alexandre Dumas was strongly critical of the construction of the new bridge, commenting that \"it was reserved for the eighteenth century to dishonour a monument which the barbarians of the fifth had not dared to destroy.\" The Pont du Gard continued to deteriorate and by the time Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e saw it in 1835 it was at serious risk of collapse from erosion and the loss of stonework.Napoleon III, who had a great admiration for all things Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close interest in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisn\u00e9 to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855\u201358, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed at one end and the conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.There have been a number of subsequent projects to consolidate the piers and arches of the Pont du Gard. It has survived three serious floods over the last century; in 1958 the whole of the lower tier was submerged by a giant flood that washed away other bridges, and in 1998 another major flood affected the area. A further flood struck in 2002, badly damaging nearby installations.\nThe Pont du Gard was added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1985 on the criteria of \"Human creative genius; testimony to cultural tradition; significance to human history\". The description on the list states: \"The hydraulic engineers and ... architects who conceived this bridge created a technical as well as artistic masterpiece.\"\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe Pont du Gard has been a tourist attraction for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), many of whom have left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.The bridge has had a long association with French monarchs seeking to associate themselves with a symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted with a grand entertainment laid on by the Duc d'Uz\u00e8s. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits. A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to N\u00eemes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France to hang in the king's new dining room at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past. Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge's restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.\n\nBy the 1990s the Pont du Gard had become a hugely popular tourist attraction but was congested with traffic \u2013 vehicles were still allowed to drive over the 1743 road bridge \u2013 and was cluttered with illegally built structures and tourist shops lining the river banks. As the architect Jean-Paul Viguier put it, the \"appetite for gain\" had transformed the Pont du Gard into \"a fairground attraction\". In 1996 the General Council of the Gard d\u00e9partement began a major four-year project to improve the area, sponsored by the French government, in conjunction with local sources, UNESCO and the EU.  The entire area around the bridge was pedestrianised and a new visitor centre was built on the north bank to a design by Jean-Paul Viguier. The redevelopment has ensured that the area around the Pont du Gard is now much quieter due to the removal of vehicle traffic, and the new museum provides a much improved historical context for visitors. The Pont du Gard is today one of France's top five tourist attractions, with 1.4 million visitors reported in 2001.\n\n\n=== Literary visitors ===\n\nSince it became a tourist destination, many novelists and writers have visited the Pont du Gard and written of the experience. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was overwhelmed when he first visited it in 1738:\n\nI had been told to go and see the Pont du Gard; I did not fail to do so. It was the first work of the Romans that I had seen. I expected to see a monument worthy of the hands which had constructed it. This time the object surpassed my expectation, for the only time in my life. Only the Romans could have produced such an effect. The sight of this simple and noble work struck me all the more since it is in the middle of a wilderness where silence and solitude render the object more striking and the admiration more lively; for this so-called bridge was only an aqueduct. One asks oneself what force has transported these enormous stones so far from any quarry, and what brought together the arms of so many thousands of men in a place where none of them live. I wandered about the three storeys of this superb edifice although my respect for it almost kept me from daring to trample it underfoot. The echo of my footsteps under these immense vaults made me imagine that I heard the strong voices of those who had built them. I felt myself lost like an insect in that immensity. While making myself small, I felt an indefinable something that raised up my soul, and I said to myself with a sigh, \"Why was I not born a Roman!\"\nThe novelist Henry James, visiting in 1884, was similarly impressed; he described the Pont du Gard as \"unspeakably imposing, and nothing could well be more Roman.\" He commented:\n\nThe hugeness, the solidity, the unexpectedness, the monumental rectitude of the whole thing leave you nothing to say \u2013 at the time \u2013 and make you stand gazing. You simply feel that it is noble and perfect, that it has the quality of greatness ... When the vague twilight began to gather, the lonely valley seemed to fill itself with the shadow of the Roman name, as if the mighty empire were still as erect as the supports of the aqueduct; and it was open to a solitary tourist, sitting there sentimental, to believe that no people has ever been, or will ever be, as great as that, measured, as we measure the greatness of an individual, by the push they gave to what they undertook. The Pont du Gard is one of the three or four deepest impressions they have left; it speaks of them in a manner with which they might have been satisfied.\nThe mid-19th-century writer Joseph M\u00e9ry wrote in his 1853 book Les Nuits italiennes, contes nocturnes that on seeing the Pont du Gard:\n\n[O]ne is struck dumb with astonishment; you are walking in a desert where nothing reminds you of man; cultivation has disappeared; there are ravines, heaths, blocks of rock, clusters of rushes, oaks, massed together, a stream which flows by a melancholy strand, wild mountains, a silence like that of Thebaid, and in the midst of this landscape springs up the most magnificent object that civilization has created for the glory of the fine arts.\nHilaire Belloc wrote in 1928 that:\n\n[W]hen one sees the thing all that is said of it comes true. Its isolation, its dignity, its weight, are all three awful. It looks as though it had been built long before all record by beings greater than ourselves, and were intended to stand long after the dissolution of our petty race. One can repose in it. I confess to a great reluctance to praise what has been praised too much; but so it is. A man, suffering from the unrest of our time, might do worse than camp out for three days, fishing and bathing under the shadow of the Pont du Gard.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEifel Aqueduct\nList of aqueducts in the city of Rome\nList of Roman aqueduct bridges\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Pont du Gard museum website\nPont du Gard at Structurae\nScale model of the Pont du Gard in Room IX of the Museo della Civilt\u00e0 Romana in Rome.",

Augustus\u2019 son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, is credited with its conception. Three tiers of arches rise to a height of 155 feet (47 m). The first tier is composed of 6 arches, from 51 to 80 feet (15 to 24 m) wide, the largest spanning the river; the second tier is composed of 11 arches of the same dimensions; the third, carrying the conduit, is composed of 35 smaller (15-foot) arches. Like many of the best Roman constructions, it was built without mortar. The structure was severely damaged in the 5th century but was restored in 1743. A highway bridge has since been added to the structure alongside its base.Pont du Gard, N\u00eemes, Fr.Ewing Galloway ",

          "It's an aqueduct. Not much to say. Spent about 10 minutes there. It was a peaceful visit, not crowded. There's a tunnel you can walk through or you can walk across the aqueduct. This seems like a good place for kids. It has a large grass area to run and play but, it is near",
          "Take a nice ride out of Avignon and into the country to visit this place. It's beautifully situated in a nice park. We viewed it from a short distance away in an open field, which is the best way to get the full feel for the immensity of this place. Visitors can also hike",

          "It is hard to believe how impressive this huge structure actually is! And that Romans built it and the 40km of aquaduct with such accuracy with simple tools is mind boggling. The river and countryside are also very worth seeing. There are some nice walks, viewpoints, restaurant",

          "A great way to spend the afternoon, out in nature. Paths for hikes and a clear cold river to swim (bring a suit or have wet undies!), idyllic setting. My mom and I only spent an hour, but if I were here with my husband we would be doing some swimming or kayaking for sure. The",

          "We visited the Pont du Gard aqueduct on a Princess Excursion. We have been fascinated by aqueducts since studying them in school so we were excited about the opportunity to see one close up. Our guide gave us a lot of background on aqueducts which was very helpful. It is one of",

          "A trip to France isn\u2019t complete without costing this amazing almost 2000 year old structure. The views from the top and the walk across the concrete bridge right beside the old structure gives you an appreciation for the engineering genius that existed so long ago. The museum",
          "We've visited this site with family because there is not only this bridge but also artistic museum and a childerens play/educational area. You can choose to walk around the park with different routes of different lengths (between 3km and 12km) to have the best views of the park",

          "What more is there to say about this marvel of ancient architecture more than 2000 years old? Never been bettered. Seen from a canoe going downriver or from a cliff above, it retains its silent majesty.",
          "We stopped by at 6 pm to enjoy the aqueduct ruins, and it was awesome. There was no charge for parking, the weather was starting to cool, the crowds had thinned, and the walk was relaxing and beautiful. Now, the museum, shops, and peripheral businesses are all closed after 5, so",

          "For me this is a must see, constructed in 40-60 AD to carry water from Uz\u00e8s to the Roman colony of Nimes. The Roman Aquduce is so beautiful and I have never seen anything like it before. How cool to be able to walk across it and photograph it from all angles, I will always be",

          "Completed in the first century AD, this is a piece of architecture I studied years ago and it always fascinated me. My husband and I finally were able to visit it in June 2018, and it was worth the wait. Unfortunately we were unable to walk along the top tier as it had been",
          "This was incredible; still blown away that a theatre built 2000 years ago is still in use! This was well worth a visit. We used the audio guide which was good, I do love how well the French market their sites.",
          "Up close it looks very massive and definitely is so - but from a bit of a distance, the ancient aquaduct/bridge combination is definitely a very elegant structure. It was built in the first century AD to carry water over a distance of 50km/31miles from a spring at Uz\u00e8s to Nimes.",
          "After making a detour to visit the Pont du Gard, we were very surprised to have to pay a minimum of 8.50 euros just to look at the aqueduct. The surrounding area is enclosed by an extensive fence that limits access only to ticket holders. This entrance fee also allows you access",
          "In advance, we thought it would be a short visit to look at the aquaduct and that's it, but it was way more than that! Nice and informative museum, beautiful paths to walk and it's also possible to go into the water (but we didn't because our son was too tired). Only the shops",

          "The aquaduc sells itself by it's majestic looks. However we were disappointed because I tried to book a guided tour online and could not due to group size, then called the ticket office who said they could only sells tickets for the current day. Theuseum has great explanations",
          "You do not have to pay an admission fee. The grand entry hall is just a facade to make you think you have to pay. The man at the gate is aggressive and will not tell you the truth. I went to the tourism office and asked and was given the whole story....walk through the carpark",
          "A must see!!! This site breathes history and will take you by surprise. It\u2019s much more majestic than you expect. And the park is really big. We spent a few pleasant hours here and would love to go back. Well worth the entrance fee!",

          "You don't have to be a history or architecture buff to enjoy this. We were blown away by the scale and grandeur of Pont Du Gard. Even better to see families picnicking and swimming around the site. Fantastic. Worth a walk up to the high ground and view the aqueduct from elevated",
          "What do you say about the Pont du Gard? Obviously it is one of the great wonders of the world. The museum is helpful as well, so that you more fully appreciate why this architectural feat is so remarkable. We visited on a lovely afternoon, so we enjoyed a shady amble across",

          "I visited from Australia and, wow, what a wonderful piece of Roman engineering. Access is easy, the view is amazing and museum explains how the Romans got those great stone bricks so far up in the air. The aqueduct itself is an imposing and amazing piece of work.",
          "We went out of our way to visit this amazing site, not knowing what to expect. And there it was in all its magnificence. Nothing phone - no extra adornment -- just a silent sentinel magnificent bridging a valley as it has for thousands of years, a tribute to our distant past and",

          "Our first of many visits to the area was over 30 years ago, the first to the actual bridge was with local friends we were visiting in April many years ago and we fell in love with it. To see its sheer scale and realize that it was started just BC and took 60-80 years to complete",
          "While many of our bridges are in need of repair and some fall down, this ancient Roman aqueduct built in the first century AD still stands. Sure, it could use repairing, too, but it may have been in use as late as the 6th century. They built things to last back then. Seriously,",

          "The high point of our south of France trip. The tour guide spent way too long in misguiding us through the museum, and we really would have preferred to do it on our own. But it was a beautiful day for a walk, and the aqueduct exceeded my expectations. Over and over I had to",
          "A well preserved Roman aqueduct with a fantastic museum explaining how it was made and how it functioned throught the history of N\u00eemes. If you're into roman history, architecture, or ancient ruins, it is well worth the visit.",
          "In high season, there is huge tourist interest and pressure here in addition, at weekends, to the river being used as an impromptu water park too! The addition of the visitors centre a few years ago has certainly improved the facilities greatly, but the cost to visit has also",
          "It is a good idea to stop at the museum before taking the trail leading to the Gardon River and the Pont du Gard aqueduct. In the museum you will see models and multi media presentations explaining the ancient Roman engineering project to bring water from miles away to this",
          "This has long been on my bucket list, in fact, since my university days when I listened to my art history professor talk about a Roman engineering and architectural achievement in the south of France and watched his slides of this ancient aqueduct. We took a day tour from",
          "The bridge/aqueduct is an impressive architectural marvel considering it was 2000 years ago. There is a bus that can get you there from Nimes, then it\u2019s a short walk. Worth it! The short film is user friendly and gives a little info on the history. I recommend the trip.",
          "Visited with husband and teen daughter in August. Extremely hot and busy. Entered car park to find out what the entry fee to see Pont du Gard was - did not have the entire day to spend there, just a couple of hours. The cost was astronomical for three of us so we decided not to",
          "It's pity that such a beautiful place is kept by dull people who obstruct the street to the bridge. There is a planned free bike path that they have made it impassable to force you to pay their ticket for a public monument. The bike path has become a forest, here after few",
          "Dear people of Pont du Gard, We\u2019ve been travelling through France for quite some time now. We\u2019ve seen so many monuments that I lost count. For the last day in France, I just wanted to have a stroll past the Pont du Gard, I never had any intention of actually visiting and",
          "We had wanted to see this attraction for ages but you can see everything by buying the general ticket and trust us, the view is much better from the beach than on the bridge itself. The museum and film are also highly missable since the curation is pretty poor and not hugely",
          "The Pont-du-Gard is a superb site - not to be missed. You are looking at a Roman aqueduct nearly 2000 years old and in a superb state (albeit restored over the years). The location, between rocks and over a lovely river, is glorious. So what's not to like? The company",
          "Well preserved Monument close to Arles and N\u00eemes. Some walking needed but no difficult paths unless you decide to visit the guided tour to different floors of the monument. Overpriced shop and cafes/restaurant but entry fee worth the price. Parking fee included in entry ticket.",
          "It's a shame to have to pay to get inside the place but at least the ticket (8,50\u20ac minimum) covers the parking. The bridge is really impressive. The museum gives a lot of details about the Romain's way of life in Southern France and many informations about their buildings",
          "200 years ago the world's tallest roman bridge was built in only 5 years. It is a remarkable spectacle and it was great to visit on a fine autumnal day when there were relatively few people there. We parked on the right bank (the less popular) and walked across to the other side",
          "We are so glad we took the time to visit this out of the way attraction. It is well worth your time!! It is absolutely spectacular. Just an FYI if you do take the bus from Nimes. We missed the last one because we stood in the wrong spot for the bus pick-up. The drop off spot is",
          "There are left and right bank car parks, and it appeared that the greater range of facilities are on the right - but it is easy to walk across the lower bridge adjacent to the Pond du Gard. Parking is \u20ac8, but this is deducted from your ticket to the site - we opted for the",
          "This is a must see. My husband and I are still in awe of this Roman aquaduct. It\u2019s very impressive. This is on the top 5 things we have seen in all our travels.",
          "This is a must do when visiting N\u00eemes. We caught a bus from N\u00eemes train station and were dropped off about 5 mins walk from the entrance for Pont du Gard. We bought our tickets and proceeded to the museum and to watched a short film (which didn\u2019t actually give any real history",
          "Photos cannot provide an understanding of this massive accomplishment. You need to take the guided tour and actually walk through the water channel at the top of the structure. We arrived late in the day and only had a hour there but wish we had more time to explore.",
          "The Romans did an amazing job in Building this aqueduct.You can walk on the bridge and there is an excellent audio visual centre.",
          "We thought that this would be a quick stop, see the bridge, take a picture and move on. How wrong we were! We took time to visit the museum before walking to the bridge. What a worthwhile and informative visit. It was incredible to see the \"advanced\" technology that was used",
          "We were fortunate to travel in mid-October with summer-like weather and off season \"crowd\" levels. We read that this location was a \"tourist trap\" but we could not disagree more. The entire grounds are large, well maintained and well presented. You can walk endless trails,",
          "The man from whom we rented our airbnb said not to bother. \"It's only a bridge.\" We are so very glad we went anyway. We could have spent an entire day here as it's been beautifully designed for tourists--large parking lots, good signage, a spacious restaurant with restrooms,",
          "A spectacular accomplishment of the Eoman period.Great views down to the river.You can walk on the bridge too.Museum and excellent audio show.",
          "We took a canoe trip, I think 8 km long. A view of huge aqueduct from Roman period from the river below is magnificent. You can pull up short and feast your eyes on art of ancient builders.",
          "We take a bus then walk about 10 minutes arrived there. It is a wonderful bridge keeping well. But it can not walk across the bridge.",
          "This is truly an amazing sight. This aqueduct was built 2,000 years ago; and it is still standing. The engineering involved is astounding. Yes, it has deteriorated into nothing like it was back when Jesus Christ was walking around in Israel, but most of the 'damage' was",
          "Well worth the 8.50 euro parking plus 17 euro admittance for two. Unable to take the tour as had the dog who was not allowed. Nice walks around the site which was enjoyed by the dog. Nice restaurant beside the river.",
          "On a pleasant day, you can take your time to fully appreciate this incredible structure. The pedestrian bridge gives you a close up view. Moreover, the museum is loaded with fascinating exhibits presented in a modern entertaining fashion. There is a short film as well. Don't",
          "WOW! The second largest Roman structure in Europe. It is massive and VERY impressive. Be sure to buy a premium ticket (with guide) so you can walk the actual aqueduct at the very top (the standard ticket only allows you to walk across the foot bridge lower on the structure).",
          "The Pont du Gard is an amazing aqueduct but even more impressive if you chose to watch it passing under in a canoe - highly recommendable",
          "This fantastic Roman aquaduct is a must to visit, the aquaduct is huge not only built to carry water it was also built to alow easy level acess for the Romans and all since to cross this wide gorge and fast flowing river. On arrival buy your ticket which will cover your parking",
          "How things have changed since my last visit 30 years ago! Pont du Gard is the same but the surrounding area has been developed beyond recognition. Despite this it still a 'must see' site and the introduction of cafes and toilets is a definite plus.",
          "One walks around a bend from the parking lot and--POW!--there it is, truly one of the masterpieces of man-made wonder. Even now, 2,000 years after having been built, it inspires awe. Be sure to see the video and visit the museum, for they provide a context not only for how it",
          "Impressive Roman Aqueduct - a must-see UNESCO world heritage site. Museum is very interesting. Parking included in ticket price, cheapest version of 8.50\u20ac is sufficient. Nice walk along river.",
          "Wow absolutely stunning! We got there quite late in the day so did not have time to do more than glance through the museum, but the aqueduct itself was stunning. Also worth the walk to the viewing area back over the aqueduct.",
          "Nothing prepares you for the majestic site of this bridge as it comes into view. You can view it from both sides of the river and the three tiers are just amazing. As you come up to the bridge, if you go down the track on the right, by the river you can get all three arches",
          "Easy to get to and what a marvel of Roman architecture. It is amazing that this was almost torn down several times throughout history. The Roman's really knew how to build needed systems.",
          "Having seen pictures of the aqueduct in textbooks ever since high school, I was ready and willing to be amazed. The museum and its interactive exhibits were fascinating, and my friends and I stayed considerably longer than expected. The Pont itself defies description and must",
          "Pictures simply cannot do justice to the majesty of this 2000-year old Roman aqueduct which bridges the Gardon River outside Nimes and not far from Uzes and Avignon. One has a choice of tickets, so if you have never been there before, we strongly suggest seeing not only the",
          "Went with my son as part of our road trip and spent many hours here longer than we expected. The heat was a bit oppressive but the tree shade helped and the visitor centre shade was a relief. You can do as much or as little as you want and with my walking limited I managed to",
          "Wonderful place to visit for those who love Roman ruins - although this one is in excellent shape. There is a museum which describes the building of the aqueduct and its long route. Then you can walk up and cross a bridge that was built to give access to the whole thing.",
          "You can approach the bridge from the left or right banks. Parking fee is included in the entry ticket. 5-7 minute walk from the ticket office to the bridge. You can walk across the bridge on the lower level. Quite a few people and selfie sticks around. The river when I visited",
          "Only a 1min walk from the entrance gate. We didn't do the walking tracks around the bridge due to lack of time..... but the bridge was stunning. If you have time, pack a picnic and wine and then do the walking trail. Nicely kept track and trees. The \u20ac8.50 was worth it.",
          "This site is place is so slick they have everything covered, from the parking which is included with your ticket price. Took the cheaper one as the tours to the aqueducts thrice level didn't start til later and this was the right choice for us as you can still walk over the",
          "Camped 800m from this site and walked and what an amazing view We decided to do the whole shebang and bought tickets that included an English speaking tour of the museum and the 3rd tier of the Aqueduct. First it is free to walk up to the monument, across it and around the",
          "Well worth the drive excellent views and fantastic scenery, from both sides of the river a little more on the history side could have been more visible",
          "What a fantastic place history brought to life. You need most of a day to get the most out of this venue. Cost is very good value for money.",
          "We started our tour with an interesting film show of the structure and how it was constructed. Then a tour of the museum showing artifacts and construction methods used in the building. It is a reasonable walk from the entrance to the actual aqueduct. It was a lovely warm day so",
          "Brilliant place to spend the day, we explored the site which is easy to find. We had a hire car and parking was plentiful, we paid the 8 euros each just to explore the bottom tear and chill on the beach. Would go back again tomorrow, really stunning place to chill on a hot day.",
          "An amazingly well preserved Roman structure in a stunning setting. Probably should have done the full tour which includes access to the third tier. That said, walking across and going down to the river give a great perspective of scale and purpose. Have seen photos of it all my",
          "Magnificent bridge. Three stories high. Huge. Easy walking from the parking lot fantastic spot for photographers.",
          "If in this part of France, a visit to this site is a must. An unbelievable feat of engineering and testament to that feat is the fact that after 2000 years it us still basically intact. There is an excellent Museum as you enter that has wonderful exhibits that explains how",
          "I stayed in a small French town called Remoulins which was so close to Pont du Gard (the famous Roman aqueduct) you could ride a bike there. It costs six Eros to get in but that was well worth it. A beautiful park set up besides the Gardon river. As I turned the corner there",
          "Spectacular piece of heritage. Well worth seeing. Take the trip to the top (signed 'view point') to get a view from above. One word of warning - the parking is expensive. Ticket machine issues a parking ticket but it must be taken to the payment office closer to the site prior",
          "can get here on the local bus from the bus station just next to the railway station in Avignon. The busses are not frequent though so check out the latest timetables. Bus stops are at the rounabout just at the end of the road leading to the Pont. Worth getting the ticket that",
          "Our second visit and we echo some reviews about how stunning the aqueduct is and how the car park works. When walking about the area you forget about the cost but the car park is mystifying. On this occasion we hoped to do lunch and view but after parking and an extended walk we",
          "Amazing in size and beauty (especially as it used to be even bigger than its current size). Good information centre and museum with cafe and swimming and kayaking opportunities in the river. Definitely worth a visit. Those Romans sure knew how to build....",
          "Site of a Roman aquaduct. Very steep climb to the top, but absolutely worth the effort, even for sufficiently interested people still in their 70's!! Also followed water to its source several Km away.",
          "We happened across signs to Pont du Gard on the way from Nimes to The Ardeche. It was a fantastic find although it was a relatively short stop we did not want to pay to park. We were lucky to find a place a bit away just off the road and walked through a lovely wood on a",
          "One of the places i always wanted to visit, however, it is very difficult by public transport unless you want to take a bus from Nimes. We eventually took a half day trip organised from the Tourist Office in Arles. We arrived at Pont du Gard just after 9:00 in the morning and",
          "Many photographs have been taken and lots of words have been written about this piece of history. The thing which the photographs do not prepare you for is the sheer physical size of this structure, as few photographs I have seen include people for a point of reference. So while",
          "We were driving from Rustiques, France to Lake Annecy and had noticed that the Pont du Gard was not far off our route. Being a huge fan of all things Roman, we decided to swing by there. This entire region of France was heavily populated with Romans 2,000 years ago. Everywhere",
          "C'est magnifique. The structure is impressive and imposing. Signage is great and in three languages; the museum is informative. It is good value for money.",
          "Must see if visit south of France. The bridge was good but what made it better was the very informative museum that gave you a broad context for roman life in southern France. Did not go on tour where you get to go on top but passing bridge was fun! Good walks around!",
          "The bridge aqueduct is a stunning site with very interesting history but the bilingual guide was rushed to give the information in French then English and at one point left the anglophones behind totally. However she did give background info that made the visit more interesting.",
          "Great structure and a must for any fan of history. We had young kids so we didn't do this but I was recommended to canoe down the river (it's pretty calm). We took lunch in the restaurant over the river, pretty good and reasonable price given location. Take your swimming togs,",
          "This is a World Heritage Site and well worth a visit. We were staying in Avignon and took the A15 bus from the Gare Routiere which is at the side of the SNCF Gare outside the city walls. The journey takes about 30 minutes. On arrival at the Pont Du Rond bus stop there is a",
          "This was my first exposure to Roman ruins 40 years ago. When I first saw it I was amazed at the size and height of it. Forty Years later, I am still amazed at the engineering that went into the construction of this Roman water system. The scenery in this area is lovely, relaxing",
          "Beautiful park! The bridge is absolutely gorgeous, the only downside is that you pay for parking plus tickets! Parking should've been included on tickets prices.",
          "If you are in the region this is a must see attraction. Very well organised from the parking to visiting the aqueduct and the museum that is on the site. Depending upon your level of interest you could spend hours at the attraction. For most people the introductory film, the",
          "Visited in February so it wasn't crowded. Get the guided tour. It adds so much to the experience. Spend some extra time in the museum, as well. You'll be glad you did.",
          "Some reviewers say one doesn't need a ticket. Oh well, we bought the basic ticket anyway. We drove as we were staying in the area. Brought a picnic and our swim stuff. Did a little walk to the aqueduct and then past it. (didn't cross yet) Walked down the river. Had bunch of",
          "You will need at least 4 hours to visit this place if you want to walk on top of the Bridge. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes specially in summer. You can stay over night as there are few hotels by the river. You can go swimming by the river too, make sure you bring everything",
          "Visited on a day trip from Avignon. Well worth a trip - if travelling from Avignon it can be reached on the A15 bus for just \u20ac1.50 or \u20ac3 return. Journey only takes about 25 minutes and if you leave Avignon on the 8.45 bus you can be back in time for lunch. The entrance fee is",
          "This is a sight well worth a visit. If you have a whole day at your disposal you can bring your swim suits and take a bath in the Gard River, or you can rent a canoe. The Pont du Gard is the highest and one of the best preserved Roman Aqueducts. It was part of a 50 km (31 miles)",
          "My boyfriend and I went to Pont du Gard to take a picture off it. It takes 1 hour from nimes to Pont du Gard on bus.

          "Very nice and pleasant location. You can do a lot of activities here: sightseeing, rafting, conoeing. The mai problem is the parking at the entrance: it is outrageously expensive!",
          "Ticket gets you in free parking and just priceless views from top to bottom. Cool beach at the bottom so bring your bathing suit, cool off and look up.",
          "Have been here many times before over the years. A long time ago one could park aside of the bridge for nothing, it was quiet then. Now it is exploited as a touristic attraction with high parking prices, but.... I would not have missed to see it another time, it is so",
          "Can't help but be impressed by this massive structure and wonder how it could be built in those days. Can very well make a day of it by swimming or khayaking in the crystal clear waters. Great spot for families.",
          "Photos really don't do it justice. Entrance well laid out & easy to access. Bring your swimming gear!",
          "always impressive. seriously recommend following some of the paths on the south side to see the next three smaller remains as the water course runs its track through the hills behind - 30-40 mins max to get back to the bridge. There is good swimming in river below, but watch out",
          "This is a must see. The museum - visitor center is very informative and well done. Be prepared that it is a good walk from the center to the actual aquaduct. There are several types of tours, each one allows you subsequently higher access to the structure. If you have the",
          "Lots of comments here about the high price of admission. It's a rare and popular tourist attraction with a great museum--I'd expect to pay a premium. I'm sorry we were too late for the guided tours but we had a very long walk around. We arrived by bicycle, locked them up and set",
          "First of all, don't get me wrong, this an outstanding Unesco site of historical significance. It is located alongside a slow moving river where literally hundreds of people, families etc enjoy the beautiful out doors, swimming and canoeing. There is also a fantastic restaurant",
          "A classic example of brilliant Roman engineering. This is the remaining and largest span of a 50 kilometer aqueduct that brought water from Uzes to Nimes. Stunning to see this marvel spans a wide river valley. Many walking trails on each side to amazing views. Places to swim",
          "A good afternoon out - a very hot day, and lots to see. Good visitors centre, but we were eager to get out and see the real thing - it didn't disappoint. In scorching weather, we were very jealous of the bathers in the river. On a cooler day, would have taken more advantage",
          "Obviously the Pont du Gard is beautiful and well worth a visit BUT don't get ripped off. Unless you want to go to the museum and exhibition (on the left hand side, where tickets are needed) go to the right hand side and it's free to just walk over the Pont Du Gard - you don't",
          "The aqueduct is stunning and it's worth getting your feet wet to get the photo you want. Similarly a climb to the viewpoints is essential. Museum is hopeless as too dark, badly designed and not presented in any logical order. All exhibits modern reproductions with no original",
          "This is a large tourist attraction; the ancient bridge built by the Romans as part of the 50km long aqueduct they built. To view the size of this 150 tall bridge across the Gard river is impressive. However, take quite a bit of time to walk over to the museum. It is",
          "Easy to find with pleanty of parking. Bring your own picnic and spend an afternoon or a whole day at this historic monument. Swim in the river, take some photos, viist the many gift shops, have some lunch, take some photos, have a great day.",
          "Where else can you find an aqueduct/bridge built around 40-60AD that you can walk over? This UNESCO site is a joy to visit. Don't miss the museum/cultural center located on the far side of the bridge. There is even an interactive children's wing where kids can see how life was",
          "Being the honest British traveller we turned up to the ticket office and asked what was required as we only had time to visit the Aquaduct or 'Monument' as they call it. Dutifully we paid for 2 tickets. Well layer out site and plenty of space even when busy. However as we didn't",
          "Magnificent Aquaduct one has to see if interested in Roman history or architecture. The best view is from the hill side, so you don't see the added footbridge. The (necessary) organisation around this attraction is impressive but not intrusive.",

          "This is a must do. An ancient aqueduct built 2,000 years ago. Just imagine the planning and labour that went into its construction. We visited the museum and spent the day swimming. We were there in the height of tourist season but everything was very accessible. We also",
          "Put simply, this is indeed something genuinely mind-blowing, both in terms of how they built it and also the sheer spectacle it is to behold up close. Make sure you book the tour across the top tier that carried the water. Easy to get to by car or bus (B21 from Nimes).",
          "Great place to visit with a very impressive Roman ruin and wonderful hiking trails all around the aqueduct. Also wonderful to go swimming in the river below.",
          "Always amazed by the architectural power and the determination of the Romans to build anything they wanted. Be prepared to spend at least half a day or more if you like hiking and nature. There are short trails around the structure. The river under the aqueduct provided a place",

          "This place is amazing. It's crazy to think that something built so long ago still stands. We had a great tour guide who pointed out lots of interesting facts including that someone laid on of the arches on the aqueduct backwards. When the stones were originally made they were",

          "Some other reviewers are right, it's pricey to get in. However, compared to a small bier in Nice or a cinema ticket in London, its great value!!! One of the architectural wonders of the ancient world and just as breathtaking now. Good value cafe and superb ice creams too. Go to",
          "I enjoyed taking a couple photos, but I could have left after the first 10 minutes. It was really hot the day we visited, so my students enjoyed a swim in the water. Although it is pretty and historical, I wouldn't have to come back again.",

          "This structure is phenomenal. We added this to a journey between Nimes and Avignon without knowing too much, and not really having enough time to do it justice, but we all enjoyed it. It seems the entrance fee doesn't give you access to the top level...and how to access that was",
          "The aqueduct crossing the river is impressive, but I also recommend visiting some of the remnants of the aqueduct in the outsiders of the area. The museum is very interesting but many of the signs were hard to read. I'm in my 40s and begin to have problems to read in the dark.",
          "Worst tourist trap ever. Want to charge you for 5 persons if you haven't left the parking lot within 20 minutes. And we were excactly a bit more than 20 minutes as we decided not to pay for the museum visit. All we wanted was to go down the river and see the monument, and that",

          "The museum close to the sight was informative and worth a visit if you are interested in the history of the sight. The Viaduct itself was great, especially the river underneath it, in which you can take a lovely dive in to cool down after a lomg and stressful day.",

          "Great museum on the left bank, which is in English, Spanish and German as well as French. Really impressive and detailed. Good shop and caf\u00e9s and the aqua duct itself is incredible. The best bit for me is the river, was fun playing around in that on a hot day.",
          "Wow what a spectacular day out! Great weather, easy to find and access and great for all the family! This place is worth a visit whether you want to learn something new or just cool off its perfect!",
          "Stunning spot. Remember it from childhood. Really hot but so refreshing in the river. Great museum and good for kids too. Cracking day spent here.",
          "Amazing place. Nice to be able to go sit on the shore of the river and swim in the shadow of the aqueduct. The museum on-site is also very interesting. Incredible feat of architecture and a standing testament to human engineering and ingenuity.",
          "Stunning ,scenery,outdoor activities eg swimming,canoeing and hiking.Wonderful history here,well preserved.Clean a well maintained.Not to he missed. Wonderful experience.",
          "We came around 8pm for the night show in August. Be careful you must arrive by the right side of the bridge which is not really clear. The beach there is huge and clean. Bathing with the view on the bridge is so fantastic. Water is not that \u2026",
          "It was great to see. Just don't understand why they charged when we couldn't walk to the top",
          "Beautiful bridge in a park on both sides of the river banks. It costs 9.5 euro. The left side is wilder than the right, but the right one is more equipped, but with more traffic. Better to park on the left side and then crossing the bridge \u2026",
          "One of the best historic landmarks I have visited. Great parking, entrance is very comfortable, water sprayed to ease the heat. Very well mainainted. Museum was a bit too dark too my liking.",
          "It's incredible this is still standing.  Beautiful setting and park.  Worth the visit.",
          "Such a beautiful setting. Nice little lunch at the restaurant. A little swim in the river with the little one and a bit of a hike. Truly worth a visit. \n\nThe only ridiculous thing is that if you come by foot there is no free entry or reduced entry. Might as well come by car. Same price.",
          "Great place to visit. Incredible that such a huge structure was built such a long time ago! And it can all be enjoyed with a nice pick of at the river bank! We visited the place over Easter and had French families having picnics all over. A really nice and relaxed atmosphere.",
          "Be forewarned: it costs \u20ac9.50 per adult  (summer 2019) just to park within sight of this awesome historic attraction and walk around. The staff is nice and the museum is very well done, but it was exceptionally disappointing that NEITHER of \u2026",
          "Absolutely incredible place. 2000 years old and beautifully well kept. An important part of Roman history and a lovely place to come and relax with a picnic. We even saw a light show projected onto the bridge at night which was great",
          "A really well cared for area, very clean and equipped to handle lots of visitors. Nice flat and wide footpaths. The bridge itself is stunning and in great condition. Best spot for a photo in my opinion is from down in the river. Admission is 9.50 euros which includes your parking on the way out.",
          "A great of Art. Couldn't believe that this bridge just to get the water from hill to hill",
          "Simply breath taking, cannot recommend visiting and viewing this amazing structure enough, also if you go in the summer you can walk the top archway",
          "Great experience and great views. It's worth a visit if you have the time.",
          "Out of this world!  Incredible what they achieved all those centuries ago and it's still standing.  A \"got to\" visit !!",
          "Gorgeous. Worth a visit of a few hours. The museum was OK - but there were issues with the audio-visual not working properly.\nThe bridge - aquaduct is truly amazing.\nIf you have a nice day - take a picnic basket and sit along the grassy banks of the river. Just magnificent.",
          "I am sure the Pont du Gard is a great monument( according to photos).\nThe downside is that it is completely guarded off and you have to pay \u20ac 10.- just to look at some old bridge.\nSo we drove off and enjoyed the rest of France.",
          "Part of the European History, a unique monument very well kept.",
          "Amazing piece of history surrounded by beautiful easy walks.\nWorld Heritage",
          "Excellent place to visit in spring and autumn. We went in the middle of summer and the heat was unbearable. No seating under a shade. Long walk from the parking to the site. But overall beautiful place to visit",
          "\u20ac9.5 per person per entry inclusive of carparking fee. There is an educational area for kids to play games in discovery of the ancient history. A museum featuring a 13-minute film documenting the bridge over  time.\nThis architecture is a \u2026",
          "Very nice place especially at night because you can see the water floating under the Roman waterway and there are lights that are brightening the waterway. A got-to-go place if you are in southern France.",
          "It is what it says on the tin! The highest aqueduct the Romans built and deservedly popular.  When I first came here entrance was free and you could drive over the contiguous bridge - not anymore! A big visitors' centre new deftly extracts \u2026",
          "A marvellous historical place to visit and to explore whether you are single or with family. You can spend whole day there and enjoy a river view so natural. Ofcourse a good place to do picnic.",
          "Lovely place, Bridge architecture in itself is marvelous. How a connecting bridge was made next to the canal n is beautiful no doubts...",
          "This is the perfect place. A lot of places for rest and swimming. Very beautiful aqueduct by Roman age. My recommendation to visit.",
          "Wonderful place - if you can come out of the busy season it\u2019s perfect. Take your swimming gear since there\u2019s a spot to swim in the river. Bistro with view on the pont. NOTE: the entrance fee for adults is 9,5 eur; however the GR walking \u2026",
          "Am absolute Must-See if you're interested in Roman history. A fascinating museum with extraordinary exhibits.  Go.",
          "The history and math behind this aqueduct is amazing. And with access to fresh water, the swimming is really nice as well",
          "Pont du Gard is definitely worth of visiting even, if you are not a fun of history. Absolutely fantastic ancient Roman aqueduct standing solidly on the rock basis for more than 2000 years. Don\u00b4t forget to take your swimming dress and swim under the bridge.",
          "Gotta go and do the full tour before it is closed off for good! Its UNESCO designation will require some changes to the tours to better preserve this incredible landmark. We went on a weekday in the winter and it was practically deserted. Judging by the massive car park, it looks like it would be a complete madhouse in the summertime.",
          "Highly recommended for a whole day stop during the summer. Swimsuit mandatory.",
          "Brilliant site for all the family. Well organised to preserve the integrity of the bridge. Good food and drink facilities at the entrance and exhibitions and films about the Pont du Gard. Once on the other side of the river, after crossing the bridge, an excellent restaurant and another cafe/snack bar with wonderful views of the Pont.",
          "Absolutely stunning. A beautiful work of architecture from the Roman age crossing the river near Nimes. Definitely a must see if you are in this area.",
          "Beautiful Place for day trip!!! It has public transport to access till this place from Avignon Station. It takes a bit time but it is worth.",
          "The place you can relax whole day long, the river is great but you should take special shoes to walk in the water due to stone riverbed. The views are amazing and after sundown Pont du gard is lighten up with all the colors of the rainbow. \u2026",
          "Almost 10\u20ac entrance fee per person. It is not possible to just take a quick look at the monument for free (or low money). We decided not to visit as we considered it to be too expensive for taking a look at an ancient bridge.",
          "Beautiful. Good for a swim in summer, and a real feature of the area.",
          "Impressive 2000 year old building for water transport to Nimes. Was here in 1974 or 1975 too as child. At that time you could really walk over the bridge. We watched the movie in the museum but besides nice camera work it was not an impressive movie.",
          "What an awesome history lesson. I was there in 2012. Pease look up the aquiducts of California and compare photos. I'm sure there are aquiducts all over the world. The Romans were so resourceful.",
          "Great place to have a dip in the river and enjoy the sunshine. I recommend hiring a kayak further up stream and then kayaking down with a packed lunch and swimmers ready. Well worth family say out, apparently the the Port di Gard lights up and night (summer time after 22:30). If we had another day i would return and stay longer!",
          "Went stand up paddle boarding under the bridge. Very nice experience, besides a lot of tourist and kayakers. That was the only negative aspect. But it was high season.",
          "Not bad, but I felt It was expensive for what you can see. At least they could have removed some trees for better view.",
          "Lovely place I really high recommend",
          "A real must see, while in France. Take the tour, they explain so much of the history. Make sure you put aside at least a couple hours so you can enjoy it all and see everything. The bath on the other sidenof the river. The very top is to \u2026",
          "I was lucky to see this 40 years ago when there was just the structure itself and you could go out and walk along the top. The wonder of it is now somewhat crushed by the weight of tourist infrastructure, 50 foot wide concrete paths, numerous cafes etc and by the sheer number of visitors.",
          "A lot bigger than you might think. Easy to walk around and parking space available very well.",
          "Beautiful and powerful at the same time. Excellent river to cool off on a hot day. Great facilities and bathrooms as well.",
          "Happend to be nearby in Uzes, and got there after the right bank visitor entrance was closed. Followed the signs to the left side, where there was a wine tasting event. Great evening watching the sunset over the bridge. Staggering.",
          "Very impressive and would highly recommend a visit. A very peaceful site",
          "Breathtaking monument. Great place to have a dip In the Gard. Beware of the holiday canoeists they're like their Sunday driver counterparts...",
          "This demonstrates exactly what the Romans did for us.  The museum is cleverly done but a little too dark for me to read some of the notices without a struggle",
          "This is your standard tourist trap, pay parking, pay to get in the gate. Not exactly cheap but I'm guessing it costs to maintain the site. Parking is good plenty of space then about a 5 min walk to the entrance. Nice little cafe / ice cream shop on the inside. Kids and adults can swim in the river. I'd still say it's worth seeing.",
          "If you are going provence, this is one of the must! Great for kids as well, there's great experience oriented museum for kids!",
          "Unmissable monument in the area!  You can walk up to both sides of the aqueduct and down into the river.  Cafe and restaurant are a little pricey so be prepared to pay or bring your own refreshments.",
          "Such a sense of history. Recommend seeing the museum first and then visit the viaduc. Will be back for a swim.",
          "Wonderful place to visit when in the local area. The Easter festival they have is definitely worth a visit. A very famous French monument. Normally one of the hottest places in France.\n\nMany people bring picnics to and spend the day here. \u2026",
          "Amazing place. Incradible structure build by the Romans. Spectacular.",
          "Awe inspiring. Do not miss this stop in southern France. Went in early March and the weather, even at sunset was wonderful and the light was incredible. Good orientation movie. Student discount tickets with ID. Helpful staff.",
          "A cool place with a beautiful view. I found the museum not too interesting for me but others I travelled with really enjoyed it. We had a picnic below the near the aqueduct and that was a great experience. I would definitely recommend to \u2026",
          "A site worth taking the time to see if you are in the area. The cafe on the path is not worth the time or expense. The museum is informative and interesting; we particularly enjoyed the children's area.",
          "A must see in the southern region. Don\u2019t forget to bring your swimming trunks, you can actually take a bath in the river just under Pont du Gard. Essentially a good place for a walk in the nature.",
          "Very spectacular both in location and construction. Much better though if the Mistral is not howling. Best to park on Rive Gauche, where the museum is located. Best lookout point on Rive Droite.",
          "Very pretty. Make sure to check out the vegetation parcour. Also bring a swimsuit, you can swim/kayak in the river under the aqueduct.",
          "Was going to skip this thinking it was just an aqueduct. Glad I didn't because it's not just the architecture. It's a national park and is just splendid. Views, atmosphere, the relaxing surroundings...until all the school kids came and ruined the peace...\n\nLots of tourists.",
          "Nice place and if you are around why not to see it. Entrance for 9,50 and children up to 12 free entrance. You can swim in the river which is clean have a picnic or just walk around.",
          "Must see in this region. Really impressive and if the weather is good, do not forget swimming gear.",
          "Takes your breath away. Monumental, in perfect light. Be sure to go to the museum, too.",
          "Fabulous piece of history,2000 years ago the Romans built this amazing construction in just 5 years",
          "Check out the museum for a comprehensive history of the region, construction of the aquaduct, and lifestyle of the Gallic Nimes",
          "A worthwhile visit plenty of different walks around the site,you can take a picnic inside and also swim in the river they have good facilities and easy access for people with reduced mobility and amazing bridge from another time there are also some old Olive trees from long long time ago from a land not so far away",
          "I went back in the early 2000's and the structure itself is amazing, but time has not been kind to the beurocratic mess that is admissions. Think if they treated this amazing piece of Roman engineering like a ride at Disneyland. Maybe it's better if you go with a guided tour group?",
          "Spectacular, high and long.  Must see.  Beautiful setting.",
          "Beautiful place. Well worth the visit, remember however to research which side to park on, one is closer to the bridge than the other.",
          "Stunning Roman Aquaduct. Costs \u20ac9 per person but if you follow a walking trail you cam avoid the cost. Turn right before the main entrance and walk through the Olive groves. Use Google earth to navigate.",
          "Excellent facilities with lots of parking and nice flat paths suitable for all to access. The Pont du Gard it's self is incredible and well worth a visit. The cafe offers good food at reasonable prices.",
          "This is an amazing relic. The hiking is easy and the aqueduct is beautiful.",
          "Fantastic place! If you have a chance to see it, you should!",

          "Impressive work by Roman long long time ago. Nice work and museum. Make sure you prepare 2-3hrs I\u2019d you intend to check out museum on site.",
          "What an amazing experience. Awe inspiring. Highly recommended",
          "Check it out. Pretty cool. Don't need more than an hour here.",
          "A beautifully preserved Roman aqueduct with an interesting museum and a beautiful river, lovely to go kayaking on or diving off high stone banks or a refreshing swim in the summer. I'll make sure I come back again!",

          "Really an amazing structure to behold, especially since it was constructed around 40-60AD and took 15 years to build. When you see how large the bridge / aqueduct is, and realize that it was built with ropes, pulleys and a lot of sweat, it \u2026",
          "Amazing architecture and beautiful views.\n\nIf you have time, bring a swimsuit for the river. Visit the aqua ducts first thing to avoid the heat, then see the museum as the day heats up.",
          "This bridge just puts life into perspective seeing how old it is. So phenomenal and recommend walking up to a viewpoint to see the bridge.",
          "I think the pont du Gard is an amazing monument, breathtaking to see. I recommend bringing your swimming trunks to have a swim in the river underneath.",
          "Great historical aquaduct, good museum and a 12min movie in a cinema about the aquaduct.  Well worth the visit.",
          "Fantastic. The bridge is set in a park, so you pay an entry fee, around \u20ac9 for the whole area, including river where people were swimming and picnicking. The aquaduct itself is awesome. So huge and intact. The museum is also very informative and well laid out, nd the cinema shows a great film about the aquaduct.",
          "Impressive! Really good cine intro and museum. Facilities all modern and clean",
          "Just sensational. An out of this world experience and a chance to cool off with a swim on a blisteringly hot day",

          "Great spot well worth a visit",

          "Proposed to my wife here 14 June 2001.  Anything that stands for 2 millennia, and is the largest Military structure constructed by a Roman Legion gives the permanence to my proposal I was looking for as a 25 year vet myself.    May it stand forever",
          "The bridge is worth but be aware that the parking is a rip off. In fact, the access to the bridge is free of charge (by wall or bike), but they ask you 9.50 EUR/person to access the parking and museum. Just drop your family and friends \u2026",
          "Make sure you go for a swim in the river. Great.",

          "Impressive\nVery impressive.",
          "Great place to visit. I totally recommend this aqueduct which was built by the Romana more than 2000 years ago! You can spend here half a day easily and the restaurants are decent",

          "The scale of this place is unbelievable. An amazing site you can't miss",
          "To visit this milestone of Roman architecture, plan enough time. There are many views to explore, from almost to the top of the aqueduct (the upper most part is only available with a guided tour) down to the river banks. Well prepared paths \u2026",
          "Hairy Bikers visit inspired me to go. Not disappointed, an amazing place. Very very hot when I went but a beautiful clear clean fresh water river to bath in so bring your swimming stuff!

          "Spectacular! Just no drones... absolute must to visit",
          "A truly breathtaking experience. It really is one of those sights that you need to experience personally to fully comprehend the scale of the aquaduct. Like the Colosseum and the Eiffel tower the photos do not do them justice. An extremely \u2026",

          "Wow! What a place. This epic feat of engineering rises above a beautiful landscape right out of a painting. I read about this place when I got into the Romans in high school. It was fantastic to see it in person. I highly recommend the tour \u2026",
          "More than just a bridge!  This is an amazing example of Roman engineering at its best.  It has survived for nearly two thousand years and is still standing.  The museum is an excellent example of a good exhibition in the way only the French \u2026",

          "We stopped in here along a trip, but decided not to visit the aquaduct after we saw how long the lines were to get ticket. We ate our packed lunch with our kids then left, expecting to pay for parking because we had been been in the parking \u2026",
          "An emotional experience, an impressive view, a educational trip. Le Pont du gard, expresses the power of the Roman empire! You can have a walk along the gard in a beautiful landscape and don't miss the interactive museum...especially for kids",
          "Great place to spend half a day. Well worth the trip. Good museum and children's museum with plenty of interactive information. The site is good for a picnic or a swim in the river.",

          "Always a pleasure!! Splendid site",
          "A beautiful and breathtaking technological marvel from the roman era with spectacular views of the valley and river. If you go on a hot day, take your swimming costume. The water is lovely. Our only regret is we didn't turn up earlier and take a kayak down the river.",
          "Such a depth of history to this place. Built in 1st century and still standing strong.",
          "Nice place, can play for whole day! \u20ac9.5 each adult including parking, very cheap! Value to come for visit!",

          "Amazing architecture and scenery. \nCar park is easy to access and park in too which is a bonus.",
          "A cool stop on the way from Avignon to the national park of Cevennes. The ancient Roman aqueduct dominates the river, nature and human history blends in a refreshing atmosphere! You can easily spend 2 hours for a walk and take beautiful pictures!",
          "This is a scam. 9\u20ac for an old bridge it's too much!  In Segovia you can see a bigger and more beautiful bridge for free!",
          "Well-preserved and grand monument of Roman engineering.",
          "Spectacular and very humbling. A must see. Fantastic that so many families are swimming and picnicking around the site too. I recommend not only walking around all the ground level areas but also getting up on the higher ground locations so \u2026",
          "Bring your water shoes or you will be sorry you didn't. This Roman aqueduct bridge is not only a great view but a great place to go swimming. You can even go cliff jumping under the  ridge where the water is deeper. Great for swimmers of \u2026",

          "Awesome, the museum is amazing. Glad we were there in the off season as I can imagine the place is packed during the summer season.",
          "Was lucky enough to visit on a night when there was a great light show with animated images projected onto the bridge  with accompanying music. Amazing. I don't know where to find dates for these shows but worth investigating if you're planning a visit.",

          "Lovely place, river ideal for swimming and jumping into water, unfotunatelly have to pay for this",
          "A must visit. Plan on spending some time too, you can swim, kayak etc. picnic too",
          "An architectural marvel! The museum at the visitors center was an in-depth look at the work that went into the aqueduct and helped me appreciate it more. Loved that it was open so late in the summer. Sitting on the banks of the river next to wild thyme watching the sun set with the Pont in the background was magical!",
          "Impressive to see the 2000 years old building still standing there in full beauty. You can also take a bath on the southern river bank. Many tourists but all well organized. Prices are high but thinking that they use the money to take care \u2026",
          "This place was awesome! Great swimming hole, canoeing, hiking, and the aquaduct is awe inspiring.",
          "Tres jolie, very nice place to stay. Free for children until 18 years \ud83d\udc4d",
          "You think an aqueduct is nothing special? Think again! This is the tallest Roman bridge-aqueduct in the world, standing at 48m high, which dates back to the beginning of the Common Era (50 AD). When you see it all you can thi k about is: how did they build it 2000 years ago???",
          "Very impressive. It's possible to swim here. Parking included in entrance ticket (9.50 eur).",
          "Incredible architecture and absolutely stunning to see lit up at night. We had dinner at the nearby restaurant  with the Pont du Gard looming behind us. Wonderful experience!\n\nI think parking was like $10 with a short walk to the aqueduct.",

          "Stunning views and s great swim in the river. What else to wish for?",
          "What an amazing place. Roman aqueduct in great condition.  You can swim from either bank of the river, too.  We arrived after closing so could not go on top but still we're able to visit the site and take great pictures.  If you want to see authentic Roman architecture this one cannot be missed.",

          "**It is free to visit the bridge**. Don\u2019t pay \u20ac9 per person for parking (and access to a museum). Park for free at one of the two towns close by and walk to the bridge along one of the numerous walking paths.",
          "How can you not like something that still looks this good after being built 1958 years ago? It wasn't over crowded, and it's a great place to go for a swim too. The grounds are well kept too. The tickets are a good value if fully utilized and they are discounted in the evening.",
          "We came to visit the world-renowned historical site on a rainy day since it was our last day in Avignon. We were very happy we did, for we had a private guided tour with another couple from Germany.  One of them was an American too. The \u2026",
          "Good afternoon trip, there are a few places to buy and enjoy refreshments. The main attraction is obviously the Roman aqueduct, it is well worth the trip you get to go up really close to it, even touch it in a few places if you want. Additionally there are a lot of good vantage points to take good pictures or just enjoy the view",
          "Beautiful historical landscape. Good acces and bars on the site",

          "Historical place that makes you say Wow! For those who admire medieval architecture will be amazed. The size and design that remained till now?! Great masterpiece of Roman culture, worth a visit and time spent there. Just find a quiet spot to admire the view, or hike towards it. C\u2019est superb!",

          "The museums are really well done and super interesting! There is a nice part for kids to learn by playing. Really liked it!",
          "Must see if visiting the area. 9.50 euro entrance fee more than justified to help preserve such an important monument.",
          "It was one of place I didn't know.  A friend took us there.  We didn't get to see everything expect to spend the whole day and the restaurant there was formal dining the outside isn't.  But was to windy and cold for the present companies.  I took away two star because of this.",
          "Amazing atmosphere, stunning view. A place to visit definitely!",
          "Vraiment une etape a faire en Provence...a must see near Nimes this architectural treasure from the Roman era is impressive..the site is well organized for crowd management..a lovely cafe on the river as well..",
          "Lovely place. Too many people peak season for my liking,  using the river,  beaches, etc. But great for families. Museum is very good (although a bit dark). Phone ahead to book a 3rd tier (top) tour, as they are fully booked early",
          "Loved visiting here. Definitely one of the highlights of my stay in France. The view is really amazing. Hiked up to take a panorama and forgot to take it because it was so amazing to see everything. I definitely recommend making a stop here.",

          "Such an amazing Place. I recommend it.",
          "Place is very beautiful there is a river in the middle and the bridge is simply stunning. Is very interesting and everything is child-friendly and wheelchair friendly. You can even bathe in the river or do some canoe. It's very popular place especially in summer",

          "Definitely go there. An outstanding piece of Roman engineering.",
          "Quite interesting trip! You can walk by yourself where you want or you also can choose a guided tour. Very relaxing place with river and wood. We enjoyed it.",
          "People have said it's extremely expensive. We came in the evening and it was only 12 euro for 5 people which felt reasonable. The bridge is a must see if you're in the area, and there's a great swimming spot under it so if the weather is nice bring swimwear and a towel!! 4 stars for the price.",
          "Perfect place for those interested in Roman history and engineering. I was on a guided tour so I didn't spend the time I would have liked in the excellent museum or was able to explore the site fully.\nOne criticism is that some of the \u2026",
          "Breathtaking views, a real architectural treat. A truly fantastic place to visit. We went in early April so it was quiet and less tourists are there. But in a lovely day the bridge and the views blew us away.",

          "Classic. Must see!\nRoman aquaduct in a beatiful place of the river Gard valley.",
          "Impressive aqueduct that is extremely well maintained. Area is nice for kayaking and swimming, although it's a stone beach. Take a look at the museum when you're there, it gives a lot of interesting info about the history of the site and Roman aqueducts in general.",
          "One of the greatest achievements of Ancient Rome.",
          "Nice place if your into historical places",
          "Impressive Roman architecture.  A must see...",
          "When we arrived at the gates we were at first dissuaded by the commercial set up and price of the parking to enter. Although we read online that it\u2019s possible to park in the nearby village and walk along the river to reach the bridge we \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, scenic views with major history, the museum was amazing and unexpected with all the engineering involved in producing this beautiful structure and transporting water to Nimes!! For the ladies, skirts and dresses are best \u2026",
          "Brilliant day out. Very interesting. Bring a picnic and you swimming gear and jump in the water to keep cool. Really lovely views from the top and worth a tour for the views.",
          "I was very impressed. Well organised parking a lot of it in the shade. Buying tickets was simple, you can buy them in advance if you want. There is a large seating area in the shade to eat at and a very well run shop to buy food and drinks \u2026",
          "Definitely recommend spending the time to visit if you are in the area. The monument is spectacular and there are many walks and trails on both sides of the river that allow you to get many great views. The visitors centre and museum is quite new and very informative.",
          "Amazing old aqueduct with beautiful surroundings.",
          "Amazing and the museum explaining the structure of the aqueduct  and importance of water in Ancient Rome is excellent",
          "Didn't go to the official place where you walked over.. but did find a canoeing trip where you went under. River was easy... Fantastic to see ... made us feel so insignificant to think it has been around so long.",
          "Beautiful, relaxing place. Take your time to explore the surrounding area and you can also swim in the river, in front of this magnificent aqueduct.",
          "Kayak trip.. excellent.give it a go.",

          "Incredible architectural monument, and engineering marvel...some parts are 2000 years old",

          "This was on my \"must see\" list as I cycled around Europe. I was not disappointed. An absolutely stunning piece of engineering in a beautiful location. Do give yourself some time to spend here as there is much to see and it is a wonderful place to relax.",
          "Very Nice place to visit",
          "Tourist trap, crowded place, 9,5 \u20ac entrance. It's nice but doesn't worth for it.",
          "Nice moment to be spent in front of a magnificent 2000 years-old Roman construction.",
          "Amazing structure. The new museum and cafe are a very good addition. The sprays of water to help cool you down were much appreciated as it was so hot at the end of July.",
          "Breath taking what the Romans could build so long ago. It must have inspired awe in all those that saw this. Definitely worth seeing. Bring a picnic, lots of beautiful grass to sit and lay about on.",
          "Amazing bridge. Expensive entry but good museum",
          "Awesome spectacle de lumiere!!",
          "What an amazing piece of Roman architecture. Completely stunning. You turn the corner and are amazed. Nice 10 minute walk from entrance. Can walk down to the river for best pictures.",
          "I was quite disappointed... 9,50\u20ac entrance fee and it seems more of an attraction parc than a UNESCO site, with everybody coming to bath in the river, putting loud music etc. Not quite the atmospherr you expect...",
          "Amazing piece of history. Worth the visit",
          "Some very historical place with amazing roman architecture... You must visit..",
          "Totally worth the money! Not sure what people are complaining about!!  Didn't talk much to the employees, so not sure how \"rude\" they were per other reviews..money well spent at the end if the day.",

          "Highly recommend hiking in. Beautiful walk and stunning place for a picnic.",
          "Mind-bogglingly huge and well preserved.  Not the most exciting thing to do, so wear your swimsuits and pack a lunch to make it more fun.  The river is beautiful and the setting pleasant.",
          "5 stars are not enough, absolutely breath taking",
          "Amazing that it could last so long",

          "Holy cow. This may have been my favorite place in France-or anywhere for that matter. When we went, the sun was setting and we were one of the only people there. It was one of the most beautiful views i\u2019ve seen and I felt like we had the whole place (including the river) to ourselves. I\u2019d highly recommend!",
          "Great piece of ancient history ruined by renovations and commercialisations. Better to see it from far away if possible and go there in off pick season.  Without thousands people it looks better. \nComing over after 6 pm will help you to avoid crowd and paying entry fees.",
          "The spot is nice and the entrance ticket includes parking, which is always nice.\n\nBe warned though: guided tours might finish early and you won't know unless you call in advance or go there. We suggested they add the info on their website, \u2026",
          "Very interesting historical landmark. There is nice information in the welcome center but the tour can take a while to wait for and all you do is walk through it. I would recommend just going and parking on the other side of the river, \u2026",
          "Nice place to have a walk",
          "One of the good example how world known sighs can be. Good parking situation, nice open area to walk and explore. Feels more like a big park with that old beautiful aqueduct as a masterpiece.",
          "A marvellous historic site",
          "This part of an aquaduct built by the Romans is massive and impressive. It is one of the must-see things here I think. It is paid (eur 9.50 per person at the time of writing, which includes parking). Ignore the shops at the start and just \u2026",
          "The pont du Gard is a very nice architectural structure. It\u2019s just sad that it is so monetized and you can\u2019t just see the bridge from the outside without paying the full price of 9,50 euros per person.",
          "A nice bridge with a beautiful view. You can also get kayaks for rent a few kilometers away.",

          "It\u2019s just as amazing in the rain.",
          "What an amazing experience! Stunning! Take time to spend the whole day. Visit the museum, the kids section is great too. The restaurant on the other side to the pont is good, we sat on the patio with a beautiful view of the river and pont. \u2026",
          "Magnificent example of Roman engineering, very well preserved. The area is also beautiful with many other parts of the water supply system that can be followed from both sides of the aqueduct.",
          "Delightful afternoon outing. The bridge itself is simply awesome but the area has been made into a riverside park. The museum at the entrance adds some context to its history and construction.",
          "Interesting for lovers of ancient history. There is a lot of walking involved, some on very bumpy ground.",
          "Amazing place, full of history - well worth visiting.",
          "Not only a beautiful historical structure, but an amazing and thorough museum with tons of information about the Roman building techniques and life. Plus, it's an amazing park with lits of trails, swimming and walking areas. And not to forget, the fabulous and delicious restaurant on site!",
          "You cannot understand the immense public works the Romans did without visiting their sites. It seemed expensive at 9E but was well worth it.",
          "Great backdrop for a fantastic swim in the Gardon",
          "I am sure it's great.  But beware it's 8.50 Euros to get in. There is no way of seeing it without paying.( I suppose you might be able to get to it by boat )",
          "A great place to visit with a nice museum to understand better.",

          "Huge, tall aqueduct - very impressive! Need at least 2 hours to appreciate. Limited A15 bus times to the aqueduct.",
          "This is an incredible site and definitely worth a visit. Give yourself enough time to see it from different angles and relax by the river for a little bit. Make sure you also take a guided tour through the channel on the top level to really appreciate it!",
          "Incroyable!  Very peaceful and extremely impressive aqueduct.",
          "Came back here for a reason. It is amazing.",
          "Simply stunning engineering and restoration project. World class heritage site and best on site museum/visitor centre I've been to.",
          "What can words say.. Try swimming under the acqeduct, or visit the very good museum. There is a good restaurant and a bistro on the right bank. Look at their website, best to buy tickets online in high season, the queue at the desk can be HUGE.",
          "The view is amazing, the aqueduct is extremely well preserved.  Not much else to see around. There are trails you can walk to get a better view of the bridge.",

          "Very amazing to see and experience such an old piece of history. You can walk down to the lake and view the bridge from the bottom. Or follow the trecks up to the view points. The museum wasn\u2019t very impressive, disappointing that everything \u2026",
          "I was reluctant going here but after visiting here with two small kids (ages 9 and 5) I must admit that this is a must see attraction. The combination of the river with all the green and the amazing Roman aqaduct were realy amazing. Keep in \u2026",

          "Fantastic place to visit. Excellent big car park, good visitor centre, toilets, gift shop and exhibition. Video film was aimed at children.",
          "A beautiful and extensive aqueduct built in Roman times. This is a well set up attraction with museum, guided tours (stairs involved) , restaurants and park/picnic areas. Best visited by car but also accessible by inexpensive public transport from Nimes (be careful of the weekend bus timetable as frequency and stops change).",
          "Stunning piece by of Roman architecture in a beautiful setting. Well worth a visit. Well presented visitor centre, with refreshments available. Ample parking.",
          "The Pont du Gard itself is amazing, but the management of the place is not so great. If you just want to visit the bridge it\u2019s free. But at information center they made as buy ticket for museum etc without even mentioning that the bridge was free to visit. We couldn\u2019t find the directions to museum once we are at the bridge.",
          "A full day or more is needed here to really enjoy what they have created here. Is very unique and the kids can roam....its safe...",

          "Nice place,\nnice swimming location",
          "We are not typically museum people. I mean, we enjoy an art museum, but museums that focus on artifacts seem a bit sad to me. Important, precious things taken from their place in time and space to be put on display, sterilized, and \u2026",
          "What an amazing piece of history!",
          "Absolutely awesome! Totally exceeded my expectations. Be sure to pack swim stuff as the river is a popular, beautiful, and unique place to take a dip.",
          "Built in the 1st century AD by the Romans, this amazingly well preserved aqueduct carried water to fill the fountains and baths of Nemausus (modern day N\u00eemes in southern France). Well worth a visit!",
          "Recommend for someone who can drive there.",
          "We love this Roman aqueduct. We have brought friends here several times and no one has ever been disappointed. They just do not build things the way they used to. This aqueduct is more than 2000 years old.",
          "Beautiful! Absolutely mind blowing place! Crystal clear, warm river water. \nIf you do a kayaking adventure, be sure to use Canoe Collias, what a superb group of people.\nWe learned many lessons kayaking down the river; 1. Kayak all the way \u2026",
          "Book in advance if you want a tour of the third tier, other than that lovely place, lots of space along side the river to sit and swim in the river. Food and drink as always is expensive, so best to bring your own.",
          "Built more than  2000 years ago.  A jewel of the roman engineering.",
          "This is very hard to review... on the one hand, the bridge is beautiful and definitely worth seeing. On the other, just driving into the car park will cost you \u20ac18, which I was absolutely livid about. I literally just wanted to jump out and \u2026",

          "Great place to visit",
          "Beautiful place. We walked on and around for about 2 hours.",
          "What have the Romans ever done for us? :-) \nClose to Avignon this place it\u2019s definitely worth visiting. It was on our way to N\u00eemes. We stopped to have a look just because it is on the UNESCO\u2019s list and we ended up spending half of the day here. The river is also very nice, plan your visit properly and don\u2019t miss kayaking.",
          "Excellent visit! Enormous. 5 times better than Avignon bridge. And free! Don't pay for parking, there is space on the offroads before reaching the gates.",
          "Lovely palace for family day out",
          "Great museum. The aqueduct illumination after sunset is spectacular - don't miss it. No need to pay the entrance fee unless you want to visit the museum.",
          "Most favorite stop. Delighted to see the people swimming and kayaking in the fresh water below the Roman Aquaduct. Pleasantly surprised",
          "No way to adequately describe or photograph how incredible this is. Hand-cut stone (no power tools!), and NO cement or mortar. Really nice park, encourages family use, museum...",
          "Lots of people on Saturday! Be prepared...",
          "Extremely beautiful place. Challenge is when to go, so there is not too many people. Recommend it for day trip to enjoy the wonder of the bridge.",
          "An interesting piece of history located in a very scenic area.  I didn't have a lot of time here but I would have loved to stay for kayaking, swimming,  or hiking as so many others did. \n\nThere are signs pointing to vantage points with nice views, however the path is not well marked. ",
          "Awesome experience and engineering.",
          "Lost amazing views!!",
          "I enjoy a lot of the grand view and the tranquility of this place.",
          "The Roman aqueducts were fascinating, but this is the best. Our tour let us cross it inside the actual canal, high atop the beautiful structures. A bit claustrophobic for some, but worth whatever to get to the opposite side. Lots of trails \u2026",
          "Pont du Gard is beautiful place to stay there a few hours. It has children playgraund, walk paths. You can even swimm in the river and have picknic on the shore. You can walk on the aqueduct bridge. It is an acient Roman aqueducr that \u2026",
          "Very nice location to visit. It's a 3 tier  aquaduct built by Romans in 1st century. Close to nature place.",
          "A one of a kind building structure. The cheapest entry rate covers enough to keep one busy for at least half a day walking and climbing.\n\nBest to visit in may as during summer it is inundated by the crowd",
          "Fabulous location for a family day out. The bridge makes the setting for a perfect riverside outing. Swim in the river, jump from the rocks or go hiking along the route of the aquaduct in the hills. Taking a pic Nic is advisable as not much to buy near by apart from ice cream",
          "Great place and Museum",
          "The Pont du Gard was one of the most beautiful landmarks I have ever visited! It looks great overlooking the river and the greenery surrounding it made the view look even better. It is amazing how such an old structure has lasted for over \u2026",
          "Sunny and windy place. Nice walk to wander.",

          "Wow!! The tallest aqueduct!! Excellent museum, worth the euros and your time!!",
          "Hadn't done my homework and expected to pull up by the side of the road, peer over the edge, be impressed by an old ruin, coo about it's majesty and clear off.  Instead, you have to partake in the \"experience\" at the cost of 8.5 euros a pop \u2026",
          "One of the best preserved pieces of Roman architecture. Also an amazing insight into their engineering skills. The museum is also interesting and deserves at least an hour. In general, easily a half-day activity and it's also a great outing for young families. ",
          "Standing arches over 19 centuries old! Fine example of Roman engineering and it's durability.",
          "A truly magnificent structure set in a beautiful river valley. Best seen off season when there are less visitors. The visitor centre is brilliant and brings to life the times it was built, and explains why water was so important. They really do these things well in France.",
          "Beautiful location and impressive Roman aquaduct. Enjoyed swimming in the river and jumping off rocks after a visit to the bridge and the informative museum.",
          "Simply stunning. Kayak/canoe down the river. Have a swim. Then walk over the bridge.",
          "Drove to the south parking lot and walked in.  Plenty of parking, well marked trails and polite informative staff.  The historical site itself is great.  Overlooks are have clear views of the river and site.  The visitor center and museum have plenty of information.",
          "Amazing UNESCO site but in 50AD",

          "Amazing. The museum is worth doing first, it points out loads of facts not just about the bridge but romans in general.....inc why the stones on the bridge have names carved out in some of them dating in the 1800s - stone masons on pilgrimage would travel to the bridge to marvel at the workmanship and carve their name!",

          "Having driven across the Pont du Gard in a gold vauxhall cavalier in, I think 1986 it felt a bit like going back to your favourite real ale pub and finding  New World  wines in their place. Still, understable I suppose. Pity that visitors \u2026",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

        "wiki": "Avignon (UK: , US: ; French: [avi\u0272\u0254\u0303] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Avinhon (Classical norm) or Avignoun (Mistralian norm), [avi\u02c8\u0272un]; Latin: Avenio) is a commune in South-Eastern France in the department of Vaucluse on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Of the 90,194 inhabitants of the city (as of 2011), about 12,000 live in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval ramparts.\nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when, during the French Revolution, it became part of France. The town is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its ramparts.\nThe historic centre, which includes the Palais des Papes, the cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \u0410\u1f50\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u1f7c\u03bd Aueni\u1e51n (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \u0386\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\" accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme ab-\u00ean with the suffix -i-\u014dn(e). This theme would be a hydronym \u2013 i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the Rocher des Doms).\nThe Auenion of the 1st century BC was Latinized to Avenn\u012do (or Av\u0113n\u012do), -\u014dnis in the 1st century and is written Avinhon in classic Occitan spelling or Avignoun in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called avinhonencs or avignounen in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about 580 km (360 mi) south-east of Paris, 229 km (142 mi) south of Lyon and 85 km (53 mi) north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), N\u00eemes, Montpellier (south-west), Arles (to the south), Salon-de-Provence, and Marseille (south-east). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\n\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current ramparts, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called mollasse burdigalienne.Enclosed by the ramparts, the Rocher des Doms is a limestone elevation of urgonian type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the Massif des Angles, Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Alpilles...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.The other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill \u2013 a wooded hill in the east of the commune.The Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \u00cele de la Barthelasse, were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.In the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city but is divided into two branches: the Petit Rh\u00f4ne, or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the Grand Rh\u00f4ne, or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.The banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today \u2013 such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\n\n\n==== Artificial diversions ====\n\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the Sorgue d'Entraigues were diverted and today pass under the ramparts to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the Sorgue or Sorguette. It is visible in the city in the famous Rue des teinturiers (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first ramparts then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the Duran\u00e7ole. The Duran\u00e7ole fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage.The Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al filh\u00f2las or fiolo). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon,  the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt.All of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\n\n\n=== Seismicity ===\n\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\".The presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. With mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around 28 \u00b0C, and January and February the coldest with average daily maximum temperatures of around 9 \u00b0C. The wettest month is September, with a rain average of 102 millimetres, and the driest month is July, when the monthly average rainfall is 37 millimetres. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\n\nAccording to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France the number of days per year with rain above 2.5 litres per square metre is 45 and the amount of water, rain and snow combined is 660 litres per square metre. Average temperatures vary between 0 and 30 \u00b0C depending on the season. The record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 40.7 \u00b0C on 26 July 1983 and the record lowest was \u221214.5 \u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\n\n\n==== The mistral ====\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90 km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. Normal corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.Legend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" Higher than normal; \"-\" Lower than normal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the commune had 89,683 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAvignon is the prefecture (capital) of Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nLes Angles, Pujaut, Rochefort-du-Gard, Sauveterre, Saze and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard d\u00e9partement;\nAvignon, Caumont-sur-Durance, Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue, Jonquerettes, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Ved\u00e8ne and Velleron in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement.\n\n\n=== List of Mayors ===\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nMayors from 1940(Not all data is known)\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nAvignon is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Evolution of the borders of the commune ===\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\n\n\n=== Area and population ===\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78 km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAvignon is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse which manages the Avignon \u2013 Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.The tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\n\n\n=== Areas of economic activity ===\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.The Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.The MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.Finally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs \u2013 i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its festival. In 2011 the most popular tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\n\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean tomato, the World Council of the tomato industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and Onet Propret\u00e9 with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\n\n\n=== Public sector (excluding government) ===\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nIn 2011 the unemployment rate  was 15.6% while it was 13.7% in 2006. There are 39,100 people in the Avignon workforce: 78 (0.2%) agricultural workers, 2,191 (5.6%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 4,945 (12.6%) managers and intellectuals, 8,875 (22.6%) middle managers, 12,257 (31.3%) employees, and 9,603 (24.6%) workers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAvignon is close to two highways:\n\nthe A7 autoroute (E714) is a north\u2013south axis on which there are two exits:  23  Avignon-Nord (Northern districts of Avignon, Le Pontet, Carpentras) and  24  Avignon-Sud (Southern districts of Avignon, Avignon-Caumont Airport);\nthe A9 autoroute (E15) which branches from the A7 near Orange along a north-east south-west axis towards Spain.The main roads are:\n\nRoute nationale N100 which goes west to Remoulins\nThe D225 which goes north towards Entraigues-sur-la-Sorgue\nThe D62 which goes north-east to Ved\u00e8ne\nThe D28 which goes east to Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nThe D901 which goes south-east to Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon\nRoute nationale N570 which goes south to RognonasThe city has nine paid parking buildings with a total of 7,100 parking spaces, parking buildings under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic train station built in 1860, the Gare d'Avignon-Centre, located just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the Gare d'Avignon TGV in the \"Courtine\" district south of the city, on the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line \u2013 the Virgule. The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England.  The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the ramparts and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe Transports en Commun de la R\u00e9gion d'Avignon, also known by the acronym TCRA, is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. TCRA operates bus services, as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The first tram line opened in October 2019.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nAvignon has 110 km (68 mi) of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA introduced a bicycle sharing system called the V\u00e9lopop'.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (173) that are registered as historical monuments.\n\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\n\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\n\nNotre Dame des Doms (12th century), the cathedral, is a Romanesque building, mainly built during the 12th century; the most prominent feature of the cathedral is the 19th century gilded statue of the Virgin which surmounts the western tower. The mausoleum of Pope John XXII (1334) is one of the most beautiful works within the cathedral, and is a noteworthy example of 14th-century Gothic carving.\nPalais des Papes (\"Papal Palace\") (14th century) almost dwarfs the cathedral. The palace is an impressive monument and sits within a square of the same name. The palace was begun in 1316 by John XXII and continued by succeeding popes through the 14th century, until 1370 when it was finished.\nMinor churches of the town include, among others, three churches which were built in the Gothic architectural style:\nChurch of Saint-Pierre (14th century) which has a graceful fa\u00e7ade and richly carved doors;\nChurch of Saint-Didier (14th century); and\nChurch of Saint-Agricol (14th century).\nCivic buildings are represented most notably by:\nthe H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) (1846), a relatively modern building with a bell tower from the 14th century,\nthe old H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, the papal mint which was built in 1610 and became a music-school.\nThe Ramparts, built by the popes in the 14th century and still encircle Avignon. They are one of the finest examples of medieval fortification in existence. The walls are of great strength and are surmounted by machicolated battlements flanked at intervals by 39 massive towers and pierced by several gateways, three of which date from the 14th century. The walls were restored under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\nBridges include:\nThe Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet, better known as the Pont d'Avignon and for the famous French song Sur le pont d'Avignon. Only four of the twenty one piers are left and the bridge ends mid-channel. On one of the piers stands the small Romanesque chapel of Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet.\nThe Pont \u00c9douard Daladier and the Pont de Royaume, which together span both channels of the Rhone leading to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, thus replacing the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet\nThe Pont de l'Europe, which provides a second road crossing over the Rhone.\nTwo railway bridges over the Rhone, one carrying the conventional Paris\u2013Marseille line and the other the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e line\nCalvet Museum, so named after Esprit Calvet, a physician who in 1810 left his collections to the town. It has a large collection of paintings, metalwork and other objects. The library has over 140,000 volumes.\nThe town has a Statue of Jean Althen, who migrated from Persia and in 1765 introduced the culture of the madder plant, which long formed the staple\u2014and is still an important tool\u2014of the local cloth trade in the area.\nMus\u00e9e du Petit Palais (opened 1976) at the end of the square overlooked by the Palais des Papes, has an exceptional collection of Renaissance paintings of the Avignon school as well as from Italy, which reunites many \"primitives\" from the collection of Giampietro Campana.\nThe Hotel d'Europe, one of the oldest hotels in France, in business since 1799.\nThe Collection Lambert, houses contemporary art exhibitions\nThe Mus\u00e9e Angladon exhibits the paintings of a private collector who created the museum\nMus\u00e9e Lapidaire, with collections of archaeological and medieval sculptures from the Fondation Calvet in the old chapel of the Jesuit College.\nMus\u00e9e Louis-Vouland\nMus\u00e9e Requien\nPalais du Roure\nLes Halles is a large indoor market that offers fresh produce, meats, and fish along with a variety of other goods.\nThe Place Pie is a small square near Place de l'Horloge where you can partake in an afternoon coffee on the outdoor terraces or enjoy a night on the town later in the evening as the square fills with young people.\nNote: the name of Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon) is misleading; Picasso's models for this painting were in fact not women of the city of Avignon, but rather of the Carrer d'Aviny\u00f3 (Avignon Street) in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Religious historical objects ===\nThe commune houses an extremely large number of religious items which are listed as historical objects. To see a comprehensive list of objects in each location click on the numbers in the table below:\nLocations of Historical Objects\n\n\n=== Picture gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Avignon Festival ===\nA famous theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Avignon Festival comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making good use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\n\n\n=== The International Congress Centre ===\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\n\n=== \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" ===\n\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song, \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the bridge of Avignon\"), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.The bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some 900 m (2950 ft), but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after a season 2010\u20132011 competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\u00c9coles maternelles) for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\n\n\n=== University of Avignon ===\n\n\n==== University before the Revolution ====\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.In 1413 Pope XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).The Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\n\n\n==== Modern university ====\nA university annex of the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city ramparts. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe. The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrophime Bigot, French painter, died in Avignon, 1650.\nJean Alesi, racing car driver, born in Avignon, 1964\nHenri Bosco, writer, born in Avignon, 1888.\nPierre Boulle, author of The Bridge over the River Kwai and Planet of the Apes, born in Avignon, 1912\nAlexandre de Rhodes (1591\u20131664), Jesuit missionary, born in Avignon.\nPierre-Esprit Radisson, fur trader and explorer, born in Avignon, 1636 or 1640\nBernard Kouchner, politician, born in Avignon, 1936\nAlbert Guille operatic tenor, born in Avignon, 1854\nJean-Claude Malgoire, musician, born in Avignon in 1940\nMireille Mathieu, singer, born in Avignon, 1946\nRen\u00e9 Mey, spiritual leader\nOlivier Messiaen, composer, born in Avignon, 1908\nJoseph Vernet, painter, born in Avignon, 1714.\nJohn Stuart Mill, liberal philosopher, died at Avignon in 1873 and is buried in the cemetery.\nDorothea von Rodde-Schl\u00f6zer, artist and scholar, died in Avignon in 1825\nMichel Trinquier, painter, born in Avignon, 1930\nRen\u00e9 Girard, historian, literary critic, philosopher, and author, born in Avignon, 1923\nDaniel Arsand, writer and publisher, born in Avignon, 1950\nVincent Almendros, writer, winner of the 2015 prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, born in Avignon, 1978\nC\u00e9dric Carrasso, footballer, born in Avignon, 1981\nCharles Dumazer, hip-hop producer, professionally known as C-Sick, born in Avignon, 1991\nBenoit Paire, tennis player.\nMarianne-Agn\u00e8s Falques, writer, born in Avignon, 1720\nFamine, black metal musician, 1982\n\n\n== See also ==\nAvenir Club Avignonnais, a French association football team\nBattle of Avignon (737)\nCouncils of Avignon, councils of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTourist office website\nCity council website\nAvignon greater metropolitan area website (in French)\nGoogle Earth view of Avignon",

          "Excellent location about 15m walk to the city walls. 3-4 campsites located on the Isle if that is what you are looking for.",
          "Come to see the bridge that you learned to sing about in seventh grade french class!! the whole town is just amazing, nothing short of WOW!!",
          "We had some extra time so we wandered to the area and found it peaceful with little crowd and places to walk without tons of tourists. Paths I was on were well groomed and easy to walk. There are some nice views of the city and city walls. While this was a nice place to go it",
          "If like me you do not like crowds of people, this is the place to stay when visiting Avignon. The old city is very accessible either by free ferry or over the bridge. Not the dancing bridge which terminates in the middle of the river. There are 3 campsites and an aire but this",
          "We enjoyed a five minute crossing to the island and then walked around a very relaxing environment. We were entertained by the boat getting half way and then turning round, apparently because a guy had left his bike behind!",
          "Actually we only stayed on the island to have diner at le Bercail. what we have seen isn't worthwhile for taking the ferry across",
          "Nice and relaxing place for pic-nic, walking, and view on Avignon (bridge, Palais des Papes, etc.) To take a walk beside Rh\u00f4ne river.",
          "Go over the bridge from the palace and see the best view of Avignon. There is a cage there for a coffee but it is very beautiful and a unique place to take photos.",
          "We cycled the longest tour, just 16km but several of these kilometers were over very rough tracks. You do not see much of the river while riding but it is a nice pleasant way to spend an hour or so.",
          "Lovely city, with many attractions, nice port ,lovely weather usual. Nice food, music, venue on the street.",
          "We walked and cycled around this island from our campsite that was also situated on the island. It is flat and when you get away from the bridge crossing area it is very quiet and rural, many farms and orchards on the island.",
          "The best place to cycling from Avignon down town. Across the bridge, and riding around the island in the weekend morning is the best way to release your stress and tiredness.",
          "If you\u2019re staying in Avignon it\u2019s worth paying a visit to this river island, either by the free ferry boat that leaves at regular intervals or by walking across the bridge. Although there\u2019s not a lot to see on the island, it\u2019s a very pleasant place to go for a walk along the",
          "Found the island a little disappointing - if you're going for walking which we did. Mainly roads with no footpaths. Between the ferry terminal and bridge is better as can promenade the short distance along the water front, but don't make the mistake of trying to go for a longer",
          "We got the free ferry across the river. We loved the trip. We then had a picnic on the river banks before walking back over the bridge. Highly recommend this. Fantastic views.",
          "pleasantplace to spend a sunny afternoon, as long as you like dogs, as all the local dog owners come here for \"walkies\"",
          "The best part of visiting the Ile is to use the free ferry - which goes from just below the historic bridge. The Ile itself is flat and good for walking.",
          "So close to Avignon and yet so far. We often eat at pavilion bleu just above the bridge with great city views or park in the island lot and take the free Avignon shuttle.",
          "Barthelasse is big, great for a bike ride, you can get lost for hours and be parlty shaded a lot of the awy. Organic farms, the odd restaurant. There is unfortuntaely nowhere to swim, unless you were staying in a gite. I would definitely consider staying over here when visiting",
          "We walked here to see what was there. There was a restaurant bar. Beside that there was not much to see. As a country walk it is probably worth going. It was pleasant watching the river traffic.",
          "We walked down to the Free Ferry point (1st Ferry leaves at 10:00am) and crossed the river in less than five mins, once off the ferry we had a very gentle stroll along the river bank past the Pont, giving us a spectacular view of Old Avignon as we walked. We re-crossed the river",
          "I discovered this by accident and so glad I went. A little gem of countryside right outside the walls of Avignon.",
          "After buying our picnic from Les Halles market, we got the free ferry from Avignon to the Ile de la Barthelasse. GETTING THERE They go every 10 minutes and they run at different times based on the month. So for example, we went in April and they were running 10am-12pm and then",
          "We took the free navette ( closed during the winter) across the Rhone and then pottered off on our bikes to the restaurant Le Bercail. Great spot for looking back towards the Palais des Papes and the Doms de Rochers. So peaceful - a perfect place to relax and regroup. Make sure",
          "The island is in the middle of the river just outside Avignon.There good walking and cycling tracks around the island without any hills.From the bike track you get a great view the part bridge famous from the song \"sur le pont d'avignon\" and the city wall and cathedral above",
          "At the foot of the Pont d'Avignon, you can cross the Rhone on the free River Ferry which takes you to the Barthelasse, the biggest river island in Europe - 700 hectares - the garden of Avignon. It is a rural area and you can have a lovely walk along the old towpath, there are",
          "Walked over the bridge but the route is not particularly pedestrian friendly. The Tower at the old bridge was closed to viewing but was an interesting medieval architecture specimen. The old town also has winding streets and the usual church. Everything was basically in need of",

          "We tried, we tried very hard, to figure out Avignon's velopop bike hire system, but even the girl in the tourist office said it was difficile if you only wanted a bike for a day, and she recommended Provence Bike Hire instead. We found them easily and decided on a tandem.",
          "Free bus ferry to the other side, such a cute thing to do. Would reccommend if you have the time to go there. It has lovely views and is next to the Pont d Avignon.",
          "... on to an island where you can take a walk. The swimming pool is shut. There are good views of the town across the river. There's a caf\u00e9 which serves nice ice-cream. You can walk back over the road bridge.",

          "Au Bercail restaurant on Ile de la Barthelasse serves a delicious dinner, with the Pont d'Avignon visible from every table.",
          "We stayed in a beautiful hotel/apartment that really made our stay great. Didn't actually see that much of the island/there isn't that much to see. Good views of Avignon and the castles of Villeneuve. Not really much in the way of shops or restaurants.",
          "For some reason, Avignon has never expanded onto the large island facing the western city walls, so cycling from Domaine de Rhodes is through countryside right up to the small ferry that crosses the Rhone to the medieval city walls. Given the bad traffic and urban sprawl in all",
          "If you're driving this is a good place to leave your car for free and take free shuttle over bridge to Avignon. Parking is expensive there. Also the island is fun to explore. Restaurants with great views etc",
          "Take the free ferry over and pick out a spot for a picnic or just relax in the grass with a good book. You can also rent a bike on the \"mainland\" and take it over on the ferry to ride along on the path. It's a great spot for a peaceful afternoon, and nice views of the walled",
          "From here you will see the complete landmarks of Avignon, facing the half bridge overlooking the icon of Avignon - Pope Palace with its mighty church. A beautiful sight indeed.",
          "This is such a nice spot! Pack a picnic supper and head across the river to sit by the water and revel in the views of the Palais des Papes and the pont. There are bike rentals and the island is nice and flat so it's easy to go around. Avoid the sushi restaurant that is right",
          "Our map showed that it was possible to go for a walk on the island, but we found we could only follow the road - there were no marked footpaths. However, it's pleasant enough, and there are good views back across the river to Avignon",
          "A flat paved walk beside the Rhone River with great views and photo opportunities of the Palais des Papes, gardens and walled city. Probably best taking the free boat shuttle which leaves from the city side, east of the Pont d'Avignon, across to the Barthelasse side and then",
          "We loved this little piece of rural island between two great places, Avignon and Villenueve. The free parking with shuttle to Avignon is the most convenient. Plenty of parking and if we rode shuttle twice and walked twice.",
          "Free parking on this lovely little island and a free bus shuttle into the City of Avignon, what better!",
          "Isle de Barthelasse is worth paying a bit extra for accommodation but you will need a hire car at least for a few days; if you cant afford that, collect a local taxi drivers' card and...walk over the bridge 10- 15 minutes pleasant walk over the bridge (or take the bus outside",

          "Whilst the views from the end of the Pont Saint Benezet are good, crossing to the island enables you to grasp the essential design of the Papal City as viewed from the Kingdom of France. The papal palace sits firmly on the rock and the highest walls in the city are facing you.",

          "It was nice that there were free audioguides for this tour, which was nice. You get a nice view of the city wall and the palace. It was a little hard to find our way down from the palace, so follow the signs.",
          "I love it. It is very close to Avignon and Villeneuf lez Avignon and it is one of the best places to go picnik. You won't be aloud to swing into the river (not safe at all, very radioative they say!) but you will take the best photos!!! Feel free to walk around the island also,",
          "This is a nice way to relax after a hectic day in Avignon. Bring your picnic and eat near the water. great place to bike also. There is a ferry during the day. Also a nice place to rent a kayak.",
          "This is apparently the largest river island in France. There is a free ferry service which is frequent and accessible although there is a bit of a steep slope on the town side. Great retreat away from the crowds and a perfect picnic spot opposite the bridge",

          "Excellent spot to spend a summer holiday! Perfect to cycle around, relax, and also very well located as a strategic point to visit Provence, as the Avignon station (just across the river) connects you to all the villages and towns in the region. Also, from Avignon TGV you can",

          "Sole reason for my visit was to go to the Lido but it is closed for refurbishment until 2016, if like me you wanted a swim, avoid a wasted journey. I am sure there are plenty of other things to do on the Ile so don't let this review put you off visiting",
          "This island in the middle of Rhone River is a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. Avignon is beautiful and a great place to visit and learn about the medieval location of the Papacy during its sojourn from Rome. The Ile is inhabited mostly with farms and quiet,",
          "This is a great place for cycling. Lots of picturesque small roads, some barely wide enough for a small car. The countryside is peaceful, beautiful and just a 5 minute bike ride over the bridge from the Avignon city center. My only complaint is the main road tends to have a mild",

          "We had a couple of hours to spare one evening and drove across to the island and as far as the barrage, (worth a look) and then across some small bridges to the other side of the Rhone. Fine views from the bridge, down the river, across flat empty reclaimed marshland, to the",

        "wiki": "The House of Baux is a French noble family from the south of France. It was one of the richest and most powerful families of Medieval Provence, known as the 'Race d\u2019Aiglon'. They were independent Lords as castellan of Les Baux and Arles and wielded very considerable authority at local level. They held important fiefs and vast lands, including the principality of Orange.In Proven\u00e7al, the word \u201cBaux\u201d (\"li Baou\" in provencal) means escarpment/cliff, and refers to the natural fortress on which the family built their castle, the Ch\u00e2teau des Baux and the village that surrounded it.  The word is also seen in Bau-maniere, Bau-baisse, Bau-mirane, Bau-Cous-temple.  In provencal to be from les Baux, des Baux, was \"de Baucio\".  The natural defense provided by the escarpment, the raised and protected mountain valley that allowed them to have a protected food supply, and  the natural ridge of the Alpilles that allowed them to control all the approaches to the citadel of Les Baux and the surrounding countryside, including the passage up and down the Rhone, and the approaches from the Mediterranean, made that the fortress impervious to the military technology of the time.\n\nThe family of des Baux exists today in Naples in the person of several noble families (\"del Balzo\") descended from younger sons who followed Charles of Anjou south.\nAfter the death of  Alix des Baux, the last sovereign of Baux, the chateaux and town were seized by King Rene, who gave it to his 2nd wife, Queen Jeanne of Laval.  When Provence was united with the crown, almost 150 yrs of royal governors followed, including the lords, later counts and princes de Manville. Les Baux became a centre for Protestantism.  Its unsuccessful revolt against the crown led Cardinal Richelieu in 1632 to order that the castle and its walls should be demolished.  This was accomplished with the aid of artillery.\n\n\n== Lords of Baux ==\n\nThe earliest definite ancestor was one Pons (Poncius) (name could designate a trader from Greece) \"Iuvenis\" (the younger, meaning there was an older?).

          "We did not pay to go into the top castle, but did get to go up as high as the clouds. It was beautiful....panoramic views!",
          "This is an amazing place. We arrived before the chateau was open and shopped and walked around. There is plenty of shopping, walking around, views, and plaques with historical information. Park at the bottom. Pay at the machine. It wasn't working the day we were there.",
          "During a recent visit to Provence, we stumbled upon a wonderful historic chateau and village called Les Baux de Provence. The historic ruins top the mountainous cliff and it was fascinating to learn the long history of this area. We had never heard of the town before, but went",
          "It was a very dramatic day when we visited the castle, there were thunderstorms all around us and very windy. To be honest it just made it even more beautiful. We bought a combined family ticket for the Chateau and Carrieres Lumieres with a saving of 15 euros and the added bonus",
          "The last time I went to Les Baux was 50 years ago and things have changed a little. There never used to be fencing and barriers on the edge of the precipice ! The village in the late 60s was hardly inhabited....now it\u2019s buzzing.",
          "There is a very informative audio guide to accompany your visit through the ruins - we did not have enough time to tour all of the ruins after visiting the Carriere du Lumieres as well as strolling through the town. I'd plan on staying the better part of the day to due the",
          "The Chateau is most interesting. It is well worth a stop. It is hard to believe when you see how people lived long ago. Nice walk among shops (seemed to be the lowest prices for lavender sachets).",
          "La Bou de Provence village began to develop only in the Middle Ages. This impressive castle was built in the 10th century on the top of Provence hill. The castle and the small village, which is protected, have been ruled by Bo's lords for about five centuries. During these",
          "There is no denying this is a beautiful village in a dramatic setting. If you are going here try to go early before the tour buses arrive. It gets very crowded and uncomfortable after about 11:00 in the morning.",
          "My wife and I visited this site while taking in the medical village it sits above as well. City is a bit of a tourist trap but what we expected. The castle is only partially standing so in some areas you do have to use your imagination. Other areas the castle still stands",
          "Always amazed at the history behind these beautiful castles. To walk through the ruins could be difficult, the views from the highest point is beautiful. The village below the castle is charming, the narrow and cobblestone street with shops,restaurants, church and graveyard.",
          "A magnificent setting with a good audio guide. Just great to scramble over the ruins and take it all in. Make sure you see the model of what it looked like in the gift shop before you explore.",
          "If you are coming by car be warned that even off season parking can be a problem as the day goes on. We arrived midweek just after the castle opened in the morning and got the last car park space in the site nearest the entrance. The castle was almost deserted and wonderfully",
          "We strolled around and enjoyed the views from various vistas. The shops and streets are so charming. There are quite a few restaurants on the various streets. Definitely worth a stop.",
          "My family had a great time exploring Chateau des Baux de Provence. We were there on a sunny day, and the views were spectacular. The stroll up to the chateau was also fun, and we really enjoyed walking around the streets on our way to the top.",
          "Though the castle is largely in ruins, there is enough there that effectively recreates the medieval city - and castle - and to visualize how people lived. I've been there twice in 3 months and was fully engaged both times. In the summer, the lavender is in bloom, adding to",
          "So much history and beauty! This is an amazing place with lots of shops and places to see. The church there is amazing and the views are definitely worth stopping for!",
          "This town is an enjoyable outing in Provence. Combine with the cave/quarry (carrieres des luminieres) by parking near the quarry and walking up through the town to the castle. Some great views, including on a clear day of Marseille. Be sure to google a rendering of the castle",
          "A village located on top of a rocky mountain. Very few people live there but it is a thriving tourist site with much commercial activity. Shops and restaurants abound. Worth visiting.",
          "A great place to be if you are interested in history and historic ruins / buildings. The Castle ruins are on a hill, so you would need to walk a bit. Therefore, I recommend to arrive there as soon as possible. Otherwise, you need to walk under the buring sun. The other reason",
          "This was enjoyed by the whole family, from young children to grandparents. Despite being hot and busy, the breezes made it pleasant, and crowds were not overwhelming. The audioguides were informative and easy to use. There were several new displays since we last visited and",
          "This was one of the prettiest places we saw on our France trip. Walk up to the top, it has a great view. Lots of cool history here, this was a Protestant stronghold destroyed by the king.",
          "To visit this castel, you clim to reach the higher position over the village of Les Baux de Provence. Few workshop to initiate visitors with traditional technics. Iron, leather...",
          "Great for individuals and families this site does not attempt to recreate what the fortification once looked like but allows you to explore and through workshops set up around the site like metalworking and archery you can feel what it might have been like. Amazing to see this",
          "We loved trapessing around the working village at the base of the Chateau area. Great assortment of bistro's, homewares and specialty shops all housed in the original buildings of the Chateau's surrounds. We purchased a ticket to explore the Chateau at the top of the mountain.",
          "Visited the Ch\u00e2teau during a warm summers day in July and were amazes by the location, views and the history of the place. Small narrow streets winding up to the castle on top of the hill shows how clever the people of the past were in constructing a well fortified castle and",
          "The reviews I read on visiting Provence really sang the praises for this site. To my mind it is a ripoff. You walk through, what is called one of the most beautiful villages in France. To me it is not beautiful simply a tourist trap full of souvenir shops and restaurants. You",
          "This castle is an amazing experience for kids and adults. It's one of the few places in Provence where we could see reenactments of life centuries ago. They fire a trebuchet (my 5yo pulled the release mechanism and was thrilled), you can use medieval-style crossbows (including",
          "The view is nothing special. The castle Is almost destroyed. The guide is boring. Plus it is expensive. Don\u2019t go there.",
          "You can visit after viewing the Carrieres du Lumieres. Charing cobblestone village. Many shops to browse in or buy. Very friendly shop keepers.",
          "If you are into history and ancient ruins, don\u2019t miss this stop on the climb to the church square. Beautiful.",
          "We had a very nice visit to the castle. It\u2019s much larger than you think it is. Highly recommend you arrive by 0900 when it opens. Especially if it\u2019s in the summer. Do the castle first thing, then tour the village. Parking costs, but if you arrive early it\u2019s close by. By the way,",
          "The castle is very old -has been built in the 10th [!] century - and had been an unassailable fortress. It is not easy to get there ! First of all you have to find a place within one of the very few parking places , then you have to ascend the steep stairs to the village and",
          "This is a tiny village that appears to be glued to the rock face. Lovey little streets to wander down and spectacular views over the plains below. Get there early to find a parking place and miss the throngs of visitors.",
          "From a distance it was hard to see this village because it was built into the rocks and it was almost hidden. Our bus drove us near the top of the hill and we walked the rest of the way. This village used to be a fortress hundreds of years ago and has been restored and is",
          "Interesting history and fun climbing. It does get crowded by mid day so recommend stopping by early. We got the audio guide and enjoyed it, tho be careful to watch your step as you listen! Great views throughout.",
          "We enjoyed such a wonderful day appreciating the stunning view and the architecture. It was such a pleasant experience to have visited the shops and sat at the patio for a light lunch. Totally worth a visit!!!",
          "This is a must for any visit to the area. The tsmall town is full of interesting old houses (and shops). The hill-top area has spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and the ruined castle. Parking may be up hundreds of yards away from the town entrance down a slope.so",
          "Quite amazing structure and gives a glimpse into medieval life. Able to spend a good hour or 2 here!",
          "Our French relatives told us not to miss Baux du Provence. We are so glad we made the trip. These remains of a Medieval castle really give you a taste of what it must have been like at that time. There is a very quaint village adjacent to the remains of the castle where you can",
          "A great place to visit, with amazing views. The chateau is essentially a ruin, but the excellent audio guide ( free with ticket) brings the place alive. Good value when you buy the combined ticket for the Chateau and Carrieres de Lumieres .",
          "great place to visit. Stunning views, siege engines and if you are there at the right time you can even shoot a crossbow",
          "Enjoy the uphill walk to Baux de Provence. Not crowded in the late afternoon. Lots of shops . Amazing views at the top. The lanes and streets remind me of other medieval towns I've visited such as Carcassone and San Gimingiano, although the town is more ruined than these.",
          "The scenery of the city is very beautiful. From the city to the castle is around 20 minutes. The view from there is absolutely stunning !",
          "Our visit was most enjoyable as we wandered through the narrow passages and got a feeling for ancient times.",
          "Thee location is splendid and the way the castle is positioned, above the village on top of a 250 meter hight rock formation too. To enter the site is an other issue, the parking lots were occupied and when you find a place, there is a lot to climb. We didn't have the time to",
          "650\u2019 above the valley floor, this fortress is built into and out of the rock cliffs. We were short on time when we visited so didn\u2019t rent the audio guide or pay to see all the spaces but saw enough to be quite impressed. The giant Trebuchet at the top was a big line of defense",
          "So let's start with parking. There is lots of parking on either side of the hill BUT in order to use the machines you have to either have coins or a chip and PIN credit card. I luckily managed to talk someone into using their credit card and paying them with the bills I had",
          "The chateau is superbly located and one can climb on the top tower for a magnificent view 360*. It has a history and the ruins speak a lot of the life people had those days. Also a worth it visit.",
          "Please note that we didn't actually go into the Chateau (and pay the entrance fee!) but the tourist information said that we could go onto the promontory for free - which would normally be through the paying entrance. The views from up there are spectacular - from Marseilles",
          "We came across this accidentally like lots of other great places we found while travelling overseas. We took a drive through Provence and saw the signs to the Chateau so headed in that direction. We kept climbing and climbing with views to magnificent rock formations that were",
          "We visited Les Baux de Provence as part of our Grande Tour of Provence. The town was basically empty due to the low travel season, but beautiful to walk through nevertheless. All the meandering walking paths through the tiny town harkens back to its centuries of history. The",
          "I visit this place with a friend, two kids (7 and 9 years old) and a dog and we don\u2019t have any problem to enter with the dog. There is a special book with games for the kids, so they enjoyed the tour also. The visit was really amazing. The views are sensational. The audio",
          "This was one of our favorite \u201ctowns\u201d. There is so much to see and do! Climbing up all of the stairs and exploring the ruins. Go early in the day so you can participate in the activities like the trebuchet demonstration!",
          "It was raining so hard when we viewed the chateau from across the valley, but by the time we arrived it had stopped raining. The wind hadn't stopped. I wish I could upload my video. I could barely stand at times when on the top ramparts. There is a hidden grotto on the site",
          "I would suggest you go first thing in the morning or end of days. At 11, there were lots of crowds. Unfortunately, I did not get to see all what I wanted to see up there. The views were spectacular though.",
          "Even if you don't like castles you will love this one especially if you have children. Wonderful views and amazing collection of siege engines and lots for children to explore. Would make great educational visit. Lots to see and explore. Do go.",
          "My partner and I were there in August. It was very very warm. But it was SO worth it to climb the walls and stairways for the wonderful views. I would suggest going earlier in the day than we did and enjoy the castle asap. It takes longer than the suggested hour, with lots",
          "If you are visiting Provence, you must see the Ch\u00e2teau des Baux de Provence - one of the key sites in the area. Do were comfortable shoes for the long walk from the parking lot and the steep climb along the town. Take a refreshment break in one of the restaurants - they all",
          "Although the small village was filled with the usual tourist shops the castle was really worth the visit. We went in June so not too busy and large site meant the visit was relaxed. Great views over Provence. Although largely unrestored the castle could be imagined in earlier",
          "We really enjoyed our visit. Get the free audio guide to appreciate your visit even more. Dont forget water or a hat, the sun can beat down on you pretty hard in the summer.",
          "Beautiful scenery with lots of history on it its a shame that is loaded with expensive shops but its worth to zie it",
          "This place has an interesting history, but the best part is the views. The chateau provides an opportunity to see 270 degrees below Les Baux.",
          "The scenery of the city is very beautiful. The mountains look different than other parts of the world. The Carriere is Close to the city, 10 minutes walk, and you Find parking place around. (In September wasn\u2019t very easy, I imagine in summer is more difficult). From Carriere de",
          "Les Baux de Provence is a beautiful village. Quite touristic but you need to absorb that. The chateau is a must see. The view on the surrounding is beautiful. You see from here the whole neighborhood, little villages, wine and olive yards, Mont Ventoux and how the village",
          "Baux-de-Provence is a hillside town with great views of the surrounding countryside. It is a steady uphill climb but worth the effort for the spectacular views. There are many little cafes, restaurants, and shops on the way up and down,another great stop a beautiful area in the",
          "We visited this village after stumbling across it whilst driving through the region and so had no preconceptions about what we might find there. It was fairly busy but there was parking (free for first hour) and it was a few minutes walk to the start of the gentle climb up some",
          "This is well worth the price of admission; has something for everyone; great views of the surrounding landscapes; lots of history; catapults, trebuchets, battering rams and other full size siege engines; plus the chance to climb the towers and have a go at firing a cross-bow",
          "that this is a charming little village with lovely views, think again! It is now entirely given over to tourist shops. The best views are fenced off and you are charged about 5 euros to look at them or do anything at all. (There may be a ticket that covers everything, I don't",
          "Once at the top you will have beautiful commanding views of the surrounding valley and hills. It is very nice but not sure that the admission price is really worth it.",

          "you can spend half a day there, walking around the place. there are many restaurants nearby and shops to buy souvenirs, not recommended if you have a baby with you. best to go on a summer day. they give you audio guide to explain everything about the castle",

          "We decided to take the road to go to Baux de Provence without really knowing what to do there. We arrived, after 1h15 drive, and had a great surprise: the town is pretty, people are kind and the castle is definitely a must do. Comfortable (not slippery) shoes, hat, sunscreen,",
          "It was so wonderful when sprinklers came on and we were able to stand in the spray and cool off! As we continued our walk up the hill, we dried off before we arrived at the steps to the viewing points. This is not a place to visit if one has limited mobility. Access to",
          "Recommended by our hotel we weren't disappointed in spending time here. We wish we'd gone earlier in the day and had more time . Les Baux is an amazing place to visit . We were fortunate to visit before the peak of tourist season. We also had a rental car so were able to easily",
          "Really not much left of the chateau. Need to have a lot of imagination to figure out how it all came together.",
          "The Medieval town of Les Baux and the Chateau are definitely worth a visit. We were advised to go early or late in the day in the summer and that was good advice. The Chateau is larger than it appears and the upper parts are more difficult to climb, but there are plenty of",

          "I went with 3 teen / young adults. Even though it was hotter than a pot of boiling water we enjoyed the short walk through the town to the Chateau, climbing around the top and the various reenactments. Good to combine with Carrieres des Lumieres and eat blackberries along the",
          "Special and different. Audio tour was wonderful. Trebuchet launch also quite fun as was the archery practice area.",
          "A fine 10 minutes walk from the Carri\u00e8res de Lumieres, through the lovely Les Baux village, will get you to the remainders of the once proud castle. Excellent views and interesting exhibition.",
          "The Chateau is a great place, especially for families with kids. Saw the trebuchet demonstration, which was amazing. They also had demonstrations going in the small workshops on stone carving, and metalsmiths. Really beautiful views and grounds. The town is lovely as well,",
          "Beauty, history and a lovely little town. It's a must if you're in this area! This is a fortress on top of the hill. You can get an audio guide to tell you everything about the place. Bring a hat because it is hot in the summer. After visiting the fortress, you can cool off in",
          "The view is outstanding and we saw a photography exhibit related to the Picasso show at the Carrieres de Lumiere. We were lucky to enter at the time they were about to shoot the trebuchet. I\u2019d recommend timing your visit so you can see this. Very hot in late July so a late",
          "We recently toured the Chateau on a school trip with 42 people. We had 1.5 hours, and it was NOT enough time. From the outer fortifications up to the castle, this is a must-see. The narrow streets are lined with boutiques and cafes, the scenery is staggering and the feel of",
          "Ch\u00e2teau is really interesting and you get stunning views from the top. Get the audio guide for the interesting facts. And watch the the demo of the catapult- great fun. The town is gorgeous too",

          "I underestimated the time needed for this place and since the parking attendants (according to locals) are very observant, I advise you to add more time to the meter than you would think for the castle visit will at least use 2-3 hours. First of all, the audio guide (free with",
          "Certainly worth a visit, the (free) audioguide provides plenty of information and there are many live action shows that make it interesting for kids (and adults \ud83d\ude09). We\u2019ve spent a couple of hours walking around, so the entrance fee is certainly worth its price !",
          "When I walked past the candy store, souvenir shops and make your way back to the castel ruins, then that is were the excitement happened for us. It was like an adventure for us, climbing up, up, up that 10th century Medieval castel. There even was a remnant of the chapel left to",
          "My wife, 11 year-old son, and I had a great time exploring the ruins. We were lucky enough to come on a weekend day in time to see a number of demonstrations. At 11am that day, there was a weapons display and demonstration, and at 11:30 was a spectacular firing of a trebouchet.",
          "We visited the Chateau on a really hot day. It's basically a ruin on the top of a small hill/minor mountain. There are not a lot of leftovers, must of it is basically destroyed. However, two towers are still available and after a short climb you have a very nice 360\u00b0 view of",

          "We spent several hours here and were glad we visited. Interesting and unexpected. Much of the site is ruins, but the audio tour brings it to life. Can only imagine what it looked like in its heyday. The views from the hilltop are exceptional. Staff in ticketing, at shop and",
          "This beautiful village high on the hilltop of stone was one of my favorite stops in Provence. We visited after going to Carrieres de Lumieres close by (you can get a combination pass for both). We wandered the medieval town (lots of fun little shops and boutiques) and then",
          "We visited Les Baux on Wednesday, June 6, 2018, as part of a day tour from our river cruise. Fortunately, we were on a bus that dropped us right at the slope leading up to the entrance of the village. We had a local guide who provided each of us with little radios with earpieces",
          "We were looking forward to seeing all the demonstrations that they do, but they only do them on weekends, and there is no signage telling you that. The signs all say that they are daily, but they are not.",
          "This site is a must stop if you are touring in Provence. It's an easy drive from Arles or Avignon, and with an early arrival (before 10 am), there is ample parking along the road below the village. The Chateau is a great place to walk around and experience the history, but in",
          "We arrived before 10AM and were able to park (pay parking) on the road fairly close to the entrance to the town of Les Baux. Decided to walk directly up the main \"road\" through the \"village\" to the chateau entrance in order to avoid the crowds which would arrive later. Good",
          "We spend over two and a half hours walking through the town and in particular the old ruins. The views of the surrounding area are amazing and gives you an appreciation of why people settled here so long ago. The ruins are signposted with some historical information. In",
          "We stopped here for a while to take some pictures with my friends...beautiful view and amazing surroundings",
          "This is an amazing site, very well done as an attraction and very worth the visit! Where else can you see a full-size tr\u00e9buchet demonstrated, firing a giant water balloon? Or fire an actual crossbow? The kid in this 68-year-old loved it! Don't miss this! Well worth the visit!",
          "We were luck to see this with very few other tourists present after an usual May storm so it may be less attractive when crowded but we fell for the location and the whole village with excellent culinary products and wherever we went very polite staff to offer samples to taste",
          "We meant to walk through quickly... but we easily spent a few hours exploring. Very fun to explore the various areas and climb around.",
          "Located in Les Baux-de-Provence, these are the ruins of a fortified medieval castle built during 10th century. It was ruled by the Lords of Baux for over 500years. During the wars of religion, the castle was ordered to be destroyed by the King Louis XIII. Today the castle",
          "The runs off the castle were quite impressive but the best part was the view from the top. The village below the castle was very quaint with many interesting shops. I highly recommend a stop here it is with an entire day.",
          "From this castle (ruins) there are magnificent views of the landscape. It\u2019s quite a climb up the different towers (if you\u2019re afraid of heights, don\u2019t go). On the grounds is a real life size \u2018trebuchet\u2019 (to hurl large rocks at castle walls) and fun things to do like archery. The",
          "We saw lots of cars parked and just thought lets check it out. We were blown away by the village and the fort (despite it being in ruins)",
          "Visited here in 2017 and 2018 and loved it both times, although the Mistral was blowing and it was c-o-l-d the last visit. Amazing history. Recommend an audio guide. Walking on stone steps that old puts our life into perspective, and the view from up top is unbelievable.",
          "Touristy village leading to the castle .Displays and activitys in the castle at weekends & holidays,not during the week.Visit together with the carrieres de lumieres .Great views over the valleys.No line busses during the week ,parking close to the village",
          "Walk through this magical town before you see the Carreries des Baux. Dress warmly. Wear casual and comfortable clothes, as you sit on the chalky limestone.",
          "I can really say that France is not all about Paris when I saw the Chateau and its spectacular views. get the audio guide and take time to really listen and learn about what they have to say about each spot. It is really interesting. You will not regret visiting this place",
          "Magnificent setting, great place to combine with a visit to the nearby Carrieres de Lumieres. Don\u00b4t hesitate !",
          "The Scenery looks so unreal and scenic. We Loved it. Our Accommodation was at saint remy and based on google map it was 1/2 hr drive to Chateau des Baux. Little did we know its up on a mountain and took us longer than expected to reach which resulted in lesser time over here",
          "Kids and adults enjoyed this chateau. It has catapults and lots of places to capture amazing views or just climb and explore. It is in ruins - not like Carcassonne, but you can still climb some towers and get a sense of what it looked like in the past. The village of Baux is",
          "At this castle, you can see the mechanics of how they built a castle by cutting stones out of the mountainside in neat squares, so that the holes left behind could be shops and stables and granaries. There are reproductions of medieval siege engines all around, which are",
          "We combined our visit to Les Baux with visiting Carrieres de Lumieres and what a great combination it was. The views from both Les Baux and the Chateau were spectacular. We shared our visit with the Mistral which made the walk around the Chateau a little bit challenging (a lot",
          "overly touristy but charming town, with a great view from the ruins at the top. The rather well preserved streets towards the ruins of the chateau are filled with tourist shops and places to eat. Finding a parking spot can be real challenge in the vacation months.",
          "We very much enjoyed visiting the Chateau. Expansive grounds, amazing views, lots of history. Well worth the time!",
          "The chateau was a worthwhile visit at the top of les Baum de Provence. The path leading up to it was a bit disappointing as it's very touristy with gift shops and restaurants only. The chateaux grounds are large, with beautiful views of Provence, and explanations of life and",
          "Fantastic place. Would have loved to have rough my nephew to teach him about the middle ages - this has all the requirements for it + an amazing view.",
          "Lovely castle on top of the village with expansive views all the way to the sea. So much to see and well worth visiting.",
          "Well worth the walk through the village to reach the Chateau and grounds. The views alone are worth the alk.",
          "The ruins are interesting, though not for the acrophobic or easily fatigued. The reproductions of medieval armaments are impressive and educational. However, the view is probably the best part. Hats are best left behind.",
          "The views of the surrounding canyon, hills, and plains are great. The 3D statues of renaissance painter Guiseppe Arcimboldo by F. Haas are eye catching.",
          "Whether you are a history buff, love all things medieval or great views, there is something for you. Siege engines, the remains of an important castle in the area and its surrounding buildings. Also views as far as the coast. A must see.",
          "Yes it has become as other ancient cities in France an open air supermarket. The location is great, the surroundings are amazing but is there a way to get rid of all the same shops you will find elsewhere in the world. Come on everything looks so fake and attrape tourists!",
          "I regret going their late, also once you park your car you should go first to the light show which is all the way down near the parking and you can buy the ticket for the castle from their as well after that you can go to the castle. The castle is amazing its full of everything",
          "Because the castle is the same colour as the rocky crag it sits on, you hardly notice it at first, and then as your eyes discern the straight lines and sharp angles, you realise what it is. Looking up at it as you walk up to the village, its rugged architecture outlines against",
          "Allow plenty of time here. It was a stunning place to visit - and fortunately for us we were there in mid September when it wasn't too hot, about mid 20's. I imagine that in the height of summer it would be too hot as you're right up high and the castle is obviously pretty",
          "I like this little village. Its my mom-in-law's favorite so she takes me here everytime I visit. Pleasant to walk through, lovely food and plenty of artisan shops. A beautiful place indeed. Also close by is the impressive exhibit of Carrieres de Lumieres. All in all will account",
          "Visited the castle on our own. A lot of beautiful views. Very impressive to see how it was in the past.",
          "Just an enchanting place full of little alleyways with many surprises tucked away. A beautiful little chappel where we lit a candle and a treasure chests of shops. Amazing views.",
          "This is much more than just a chateau. There are a lot of historic buildings in a wonderful hill-top setting with great views too. One major criticism though are the handrails. For many paths these are essential, even for the fully able bodied. Yet they are rusting badly",
          "The Chateau des Baux is a great place to visit however you need to understand that it is very much a ruin of a castle that sits on the Disney- sequel and rather kitch Les Beaux de Provence. So this is nothing like the many complete castles that you can visit elsewhere. It's",
          "The views around this area are spectacular, we walked up to the top (not for the weak!) to see this village properly and it was quite overrun with lots of tourists. If I remember correctly there were some shows, medieval themed things maybe jousting/eagles... we ended up not",
          "When in the area, this is one not to miss. After a winding drive you park your car and it's a bit of a climb but well worth it to wonder around for a couple of hours. Entry to the actual chateau is \u20ac10 however walking all around the old town area will give you the same views.",
          "Interesting remains of the medieval chateau and stunning views from the top of this hilltop village. Combine with a trip to Carrieres de Lumieres, then lunch in Maussanne - perfect day !",
          "This hilltop village is busy! Parking can take a while but there is a lot of it spread out! The shops are interesting, lots of restaurants, lovely church with great stained glass, quaint cobbled streets. Yes it's busy but not uncomfortably so. The chateaux was interesting and",
          "It's a bit touristy, but that didn't bother us. The views are stunning, the kids loved exploring the site and got to see the catapult and medieval weapons demonstrations. There are touristy shops, cafes, and ice cream stands on the walk up which was fun and entertaining.",
          "Les Baux is a pittoresque small village build on a hill. Here people have lived over 6000 years. The place is overflowed with tourists. Parking your car isnt easy. There is a castle as well on the top of the hill. With a real midievel catapult, with could trow 100 kg rocks over",
          "Interesting route through this historical city and castle. The self guided audio guides had some problems, and hard to follow. We climbed up a few stairs to the peaks, we have the magnificent views of village and the valley floor I found village/ the lower town is rather",
          "You can get a combo ticket for the carri\u00e8res de lumi\u00e8res, but I would advise against going there. The old fortress is well worth a visit, though.",
          "Typical steep climb to a Provencal village but very worth the effort. See a trebuchet in action, and other medieval catapults at the fort. Enjoy the sights around town, the town hall, the church. The vistas from the fort are charming. Shopkeepers are very pleasant.",
          "Take the time to go see the Chateau. Walk the grounds. It is lovely and quite impressive. On a beautiful day, it is a wonderful excursion.",
          "First impressions are not pleasant. Made to pay 6\u20ac to park the car along the road that leads to the village, with the local police present (waiting to give a ticket to those that don't pay?). Then a steep climb to the medieval village and the narrow street full of restaurants",
          "Another must see attraction. Bring your hiking boots as the surfaces are very unsteady. Very child friendly with the canons, battering rams and live re-enactments by professional actors",
          "We had two teens with us. They enjoyed climbing all over the grounds and especially enjoyed the giant catapult demonstration. Wear sturdy shoes with good grip as some of the rocks are smooth and slippery. Hold on to the hand rails, some of the climbs are steep. The mistral",
          "The best views of the surrounding countryside, and down to the lower village, are found from the chateau. You must pay to enter for those views and to see the medieval weaponry. Arrive early to avoid crowds, for both the chateau and village.",
          "We love this place. The village is lovely and the climb to the top of the citadel is amazing with stunning views. The village is pretty touristy and it can get packed in the middle of the day in school holidays. However, if you go early or late there are relatively few people.",
          "Chateau is not very well preserved, but there is a very interesting exposition of ancient weapons (catapults, trebuchettes, etc.). It also has an excellent view of the entire valley. Be careful - climbing the steep walls is quite dangerous.",
          "A walk through the fort is a must. The view is one of a kind and should not be missed. Interesting history. For those who enjoy epic movies, there are medieval siege engines (trebuchets) displayed and amusing demonstrations on how they were used. Fun for kids and adults alike!",
          "Quite frankly unless you want to rub shoulders with what appears to be every other tourist in Provence I would give Les Baux a miss. It represents the classic dilemma of all popular tourist places. What was undoubtedly some years ago an attractive but probably dilapidated small",
          "I would recommend this place to everyone who is fond of castles at least a bit. Or even if not - the views from the castle are magnificent. A lot of additional activities as well.",
          "Really a ruin high high up in Provence with really amazing views all round, the village is really pretty quaint and quite touristy. There are various displays going on to evoke the feel of life in the Chateau and the guided audio tour simple to use and informative. This is a",
          "A must if you are in this area A walk in history and great coffee shops and restaurants if you get tired",
          "Such a beautiful location and a simply amazingly spectacular village. It is a must visit for anyone visiting the Provence area.",
          "What a lovely place. The character has been kept with narrow streets and quaint little shops. There are a number of re-enactments which help give a flavour of life in the castle. The views across Provence are stunning. The only down side was they only did this in French despite",
          "We decided to visit the castle at the last minute and are so glad we did! Our family of four adults has such a great time wandering the grounds and learning from the audio guides and the reenactments. We laughed all day as we navigated the very high winds and worn steps (but",
          "Les Baux consists of a pretty, touristy village and a castle in ruins with panoramic views and lots of recreated siege engines. If you have visited other, better preserved, medieval castles, this is not a must-see but if you have the time or if you are visiting on the weekend",
          "My partner and I visited the 10th century built Ch\u00e2teau which was torn down by Louis XIII of France in 1633 and was home to some of the most famous minstrels and troubadours of the day. We spotted the castle high on a hill top whilst traveling from B\u00e9ziers, France to Marseille,",
          "We visited the site first thing in the morning because of the heat and the fact there is not a lot of packing spaces. It's a very large \"castle\" built on the top of the hill and also into the hillside, When buying your ticket, you are provided with an audio guide which give you",
          "Fun and interesting site. Lots of history, also a lot of walking and climbing. Medieval instruments of war, ancient dwellings, phenomenal views and great audio guide (free).",
          "It was lovely to walk in its narrow streets and brows through the myriads of shops which offered some very interesting hand made goods.",
          "Disappointed in the financials, \u20ac6 for the car \u20ac10.5 each to see the ruins, only 8 to get into Amphitheatre in Arles!! Not worth it, pretty place but so are others. Go to Gordes instead, beautiful!!",
          "Biking there was somewhat of a challenge because it sits on top of a hill. Glad we did, since traffic and parking were crowded. You can get onto the grounds and parapets without paying, but the actual castle inside requires an 8.5 Euro ticket. Many shops selling the typical",
          "The best place visited so far although we were surprised to pay \u20ac6 to park! The village is amazing - reminds me of guadalest in Spain. Everyone enjoyed their ice cream as wondered through the village. We had downloaded the free app on our phone which explained a little about",
          "Lovely spot to spend an afternoon wandering around. But beware the shops and restaurants are very very expensive.",
          "We were staying nearby so it was a good day walk to the village and the castle ruins. The ruins were fairly well explained via markers and the views of the surrounding countryside were fantastic. There were some re-enactments and working reproduction assualt engines to observe",
          "A beautiful medieval town set in the hills with a chateau at the top. The views were amazing and the town was so pretty. Lots of small shops and restaurants but they were quaint and therefore the village has kept its authenticity. Loved this place",
          "Amazing!!! The old chateau the quarry with the spectacle of paintings. The picturesque village although very touristic is still the most beautiful we have seen so far. Recommended whole heartedly!!!!",
          "An interesting medieval town set up in the hills. We didn't tour very much of it due to mobility issues and large crowds, but what we did see was well preserved. We enjoyed our visit to Perouges more, felt it was more authentic while Les Baux was more \"touristy.\"",
          "Bought tickets for both (carrier luminaire & castle) attractions @ 16\u20ac each adult. The views from the castle were amazing as were the ruins. Guided tour by handheld device was really useful and the narration clear and concise. What a great place. Allow at least a couple of",
          "Large complex with old fortress on the top of the hill. Great views from the higher spots. Good signage and displays of life in the fort. While much of the fortress can be visited some access is limited and there are very steep and uneven stairs.",
          "Going trough the village, you get to the castle, at the end of the narrow street. Perched on the tip of the rock, and big! One of the best exemples of middle ages constructions. Plus a sort of museum of ancient arms and weaponery of the time.",
          "A very interesting site with spectacular views. The walk through the old lanes were very quaint. The Mistral was amazing - so strong you really felt you had to hang on! The tr\u00e9buchet demo was very good - kids will love it!",
          "The chateau is spectacular, along with the hikes, climbs, and vistas. The medieval Siege equipment and period workers (sculptors, smiths, Potters) added to the fascination. Good for all ages, may be difficult for older and less active tourists.",
          "We have brought our russian friend here , she liked very much, the ticket for the chateau and carriers de lumi\u00e8re was18 euro for both. But if you want to visit everything -the shops, the paysage you need almost one day. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants there. Don't",
          "This was our second visit to Les Baux but our first to the Chateau. They have done a good job in recreating some of the life in a castle from days of old. Ensure you get there to see the catapult demonstration (you'll need a bit of french) followed by everyone being able to",
          "The view is just WOUAHHH, it's an amazing place with a marvellous view and a lot of history. It's THE place to come if you are in the south of France",
          "It is a great place to visit with spectacular views. Our daughter enjoy it and she is just 2.\ud83d\ude00 The walk to the castle is very nice. Small shops . We bought a soap in a special stone from a shop there. Very good for your skin and can find it only there .",
          "Quite an impressive medieval site. Although we visited off season so there were no artisan displays, we enjoyed the fact that we were able to wander about with no crowds to bother us. Views are quite spectacular and the village is very pretty.",
          "This Chateau impressed us so much that it is not our first visit and it will not be the last time that we will visit. With sunset the views are exceptional.",
          "Very beautiful French village on a hill, cute little ships and cafes. Very well worth a visit! The only downside- many tourists :)",
          "we spent the better part of a day here, the village and its vistas are stunning, the castle and town very interesting and instructive. After touring the town, we did the Lumieres, which was great. Highly recommend it - a must-see when in this area, in my opinion",
          "A lovely hilltop village with wonderful views. Parking is available outside the village at the bottom of the hill for a fee. The village is worth a short visit ( we didn't go to the castle ). Very tourist orientated with lots of souvenir shops and some restaurants.",
          "spent a lovely day at this cool place, some lovely little shops and the views are wonderful, we spent about 2 hours there but we were heading somewhere else so more time could be spent there.",
          "We loved the little town where the houses are made of limestone from the quarry which is now host of the the famous Carrieres de Lumieres Show!!! We were there in October and were mesmerized by the beauty and views from the top of the hill! This little place is a must see for",
          "This little village and the castle on top is one of the most magical places in France. It is intimate in scale, small narrow streets, crowded with visitors, short on locals and long on vendors and shop-keepers. Follow the audio guide - without it you will be educationally",
          "Stopped here for a few hours after visiting the Carrieres de Lumieres. Honestly it would not have been worth the stop had it not be for de Lumieres. It is a hill top town much like 100s of other hill top towns found throughout Europe. This was nothing special and some areas",
          "It's hard to say it's not a must ; It is very touristic , interestingly renovated and very nice. If can afford to visit around mid October and avoid the crowds - you are a winner . Take your camera with you and stroll the nice village too .",
          "Beautiful views over the surrounding valley. But little to see in terms of remaining structures, and really best viewed as an add-on to the exceptional carrieres de lumieres, which is far more impressive. Anyone claiming this is one of France's most beautiful villages has",
          "What a lovely little hill top village with great views. Lots of tourist shops but all tastefully done and some great cafe's to site watch the views and the world go by.",
          "This is a review for the entire town of Les Baux de Provence. An overrated town that has lost its original charm after a total renovation. Very crowded in August, parking is insufficient at times, souvenir shops offer very few authentic products. Restaurants are very busy at",
          "Spent an excellent midweek afternoon climbing all around this extensive site with 2 energetic pre schoolers.Some amazing vistas over the Baux valley .There were no organised displays being midweek during term time and the children were too young to appreciate the siege",
          "you are back 1000 years. the chateau is nicely renovated. you can see the old wooden weapons being used for your entertainment. Climb all the way to the tower to have a spectacular view on eh village of Baux.",
          "Happened on this town by accident, and very happy I did. Listed as one of the prettiest town in Provence, it was a little crowded with tourists, even on a weekday in late September. The walk would be fairly strenuous for someone, I exercise regularly, but it was pretty far",
          "Although the Chateau is now in ruins, and the old medieval town is full of shops, bars and restaurants, it is magnificent. This is not a place that is really on the way to anywhere else, so you have to make a side trip on your own. Having a car makes it a lot easier,",
          "It's true that there is not much to see from th eold castle, besides some antique war weapons... but being up here, looking at the valley, the old stone village and the alpilles, all white rock formations in between the vegetation, it's spectacular... take your time to just be",
          "We did enjoy the restored village and ruins. There is a decent audio tour in English that comes with the admission price and the information boards have English as well. There are some absolutely beautiful views from the top of the valley below and distant mountains. We came on",
          "We went to see this area and castle while visiting in the south of France. This is a beautiful small town with access to a very old castle. You can tour the castle with audio in both french or English. Moderate level activity in the castle. The town is easy to walk with",
          "A large site at the edge of this quasi abandoned hill village (only 22 real inhabitants left in Les Baux, versus 1.5 million tourists a year). Uninterested and clueless staff at the ticket desk on entry, 6 of them chatting amongst each other rather than welcome guests.... Some",
          "Would highly recommend a visit here. Lot's of interesting history and an amazing view over the landscape.",
          "We visited 16 September 2016. We were disappointed that they did not have the docents in costume, craftspeople, crossbow shooting or trebouchet firing except on weekends. I do not think that was made clear on their website. It says open every day all year, but does not specify",
          "The medieval village is a must see, as it winds up to the now ruined citadel. The views are stunning even if the castle is now little more than a pile of rocks. Great for children and history buffs.",
          "Superb town, great views, great restaurants, very intimate, buzzy. The chateaux offers glorious views, sites and scenes and a view of how the place used to be, chagall is also weaved into this magic, well worth a couple of hours plus lunch. Great location.",
          "Let's just summarise it: it's beautiful, romantic and unique I loved it 25 years ago and loved it again It has not changed",
          "The ruined castle at Les Baux is a dramatic setting of itself and offers excellent views of the surrounding countryside. For younger visitors, or those who are young at heart, there are regular demonstrations of reproduction siege engines, enthusiastically carried off by the",
          "Les Baux de Provence is listed as one of the most beautiful villages in France. The town, built high on a rocky hill, is pretty enough, albeit somewhat touristy. The Chateau is just a ruin, not much to see or learn from. The view of the surrounding countryside of olive groves",
          "This place represents the pure Provence \u2013 even though the village is loaded with shops to attract the tourists you really have the impression of being in a mediaeval village of the Provence: the really narrow streets where no car can pass, the houses and even more, the views",
          "If you arrive early enough to get in front of the visiting hordes, this is a fascinating place to visit. Parking becomes challenging in the afternoon, even on weekdays so arrive around 10 or 11. The chateau at the top costs about 8\u20ac each but is worth it. You can easily spend 2",
          "Very special town with an old castle which still operates as a tourist attraction. Only 400+ residents total, 25 or so live in the upper town, full of shops and restaurants, while the rest live in quiet luxury below the walls - it's a very high end town. The castle operates a",
          "The village and castle sit on top of a rock. The 360 degrees view is spectacular. Even on a June day it was incredibly windy (the mistral) and hard to get to the top. You have to be in good shape and they don't mention that enough. We saw people with babies in strollers and they",
          "I've been to plenty of walled towns and castles through Europe and they are always great in my opinion- this is no different! Stunning views of the surrounding countryside and a very cute town attached make this a worthwhile visit There is a great attraction nearby called",
          "This was a highlight of our holiday down south. So good! The fortress is huge with many parts to explore and great views of the countryside. The staff were great. There was a great demonstration of the big trebuchet, a blacksmith's workshop, etc. So much fun!!! Don't be put off",
          "Great castle with great views. Cheap at \u20ac10 each. If you get there before 10am parking is easy and almost no one in the castle. Also got to have a shot with a crossbow ( which was free ) . The village leading to the castle is very cute with many places to eat and drink.",
          "One of the best castle visit i have ever done in France. Entrance is cheap (10\u20ac) and free for kids under 7. There are only ruins left of the castle but you can climb the towers, there are a lot of medieval weapons demonstration for kids and adults. Some craftsmen teach you how",
          "We were a party of six adults and two young children, and were a bit nervous about whether the children would enjoy wandering around a historical site. We trusted another TripAdvisor reviewer and I'm glad we did - the Chateau, the drive to the town, and the town itself are all",
          "Very romantic, ancient, beautiful. Great destination to go with kids and friends. Sometimes it's very hot there, but it's worth going",
          "The Chateau des Baux is a medieval fort which sit above the the ancient town of Les Baux de Provence. While there is not much left of the fort, there is still much to see, from the reconstructed Catapults that were used to attack the fort, to towers that take some skill in",
          "Be prepared to be forced to take quite a walk from the point where you can finally park your car. This place is always visited by a lot of others. You can see the city of Les Baux and its Chateau from quit a distance as it is lying on top of one of the hills of the Alpilles",
          "It is well worth the effort to park ( 5 euros per day) outside the town of Les Baux and walk up the hill to the town. The views from almost any part are spectacular and another 8 euros into the Chateau gives an even better panoramic view as you walk on the white rocks. You also",
          "The 'village' was overwhelmed with tourists and tourist shops , to the extent that there were no places to buy bread, stamps, pharmaceuticals etc. Parking a nightmare unless you arrived early, poor accessibility.",
          "It was fun exploring the ruins and learning a little bit about the history of this area. They had stands with people demonstrating typical trades (ironsmith, leather worker, seamstresses, etc) found in the old days. The display stocks are fun for the kids. Be sure to wear",
          "My husband and teenage daughter and I visited the Chateau after walking through the town. The audio tour is free with paid entry. We listened to about half of the numbered recordings, which were very informative, but at times, we just explored the site on our own. Climbing to",
          "Just another one of the amazing towns to visit in Provence. Get there early to make parking easier and to beat the crowds. It's worth a couple of hours to visit.",
          "One of the best presented chateaus I have visited so far! There is a lot to see and all of it is made up very interestingly. The audio guide is not needed however, the placards around the chateau give more information than the guide. Don't miss it.",
          "A really extraordinary spot. The landscape changes very quickly. Go early or late so it isn't so crowded. We were lucky to get parked right at the top, so we avoided some of the walk. Please note it might be difficult for some as it is hot and steep. Parking is \u20ac5. It's",
          "This is one of the coolest towns EVER. The landscape around the small village is striking and nearly worth the trip alone. Parking is \u20ac5 for the day, no matter when you arrive. And you can park at the top, just outside the hill to the entrance or on the other side. We stopped to",
          "Despite visiting while a mistral was blowing, we had a great morning at Chateau des Baux de Provence. We purchased a combined ticket for the chateau and Carri\u00e8res de Lumi\u00e8res (they are only a short walk from each other; the combined tickets cannot be purchased online). To avoid",
          "We got a combo ticket for the carrier luminaires and the castle for the best value. Go see the carrier luminaires. Worth it. Trust me. The castle was a short walk up From the long road down. 5 euros to park is worth it. Free parking is way at the bottom of the hill and a long",
          "I this place is very historical. I wouldn't really recommend this to teenagers because ours got very bored and tired of walking everywhere. But I think that is a great place because they have great restaurants to eat at and they have a lot of good placed to buy souvenirs. They",
          "You can spend many hours on your own touring the grounds which are well marked with explanations. The views are spectacular and the Castle itself imposing. There is an opportunity to shoot an arrow at a target and you are instructed by a young man, just how to do this. Then,",
          "We stayed here 5 nights and almost missed the walk through the medieval ruins. I can't believe this is so assessable to the public. There are tricky stairs to navigate but don't let that stop you. This was a true highlight!",
          "My teens loved the old weapons. We also enjoyed exploring all the cathedrals, and shops. Stopped for a beverage and a quick snack and the service was excellent.",
          "We visited this place in mid July during unseasonably strong winds. The views from the towers were fantastic looking over Provence as far as Marseille. The chateau covers half the site of Les Baux so it is definitely worth visiting.",
          "This is a charming example of a well preserved medieval castle and village. You walk up and down the cobbled stone streets imagining a very different era where life was more simple. The views of the surrounding countryside are outstanding and you can see why it was a great site",
          "This is a great place to spend a few hours. It is the remnants of a castle. It has great views but you need to pay admission to all the view areas. However, the surrounding stone paths are free and it has lots of shops. I enjoyed the the place. However, if you are coming by",
          "We came to Les Baux to see Carrieres des Lumieres and found out about the Chateau when we got the tickets as there is a combination ticket for both. Our boys (7 & 10) really enjoyed exploring the Fort and the sword fighting show they put on. The views from the top made the",

          "I have been in Les Baux twice because I wanted my whole family to have the opportunity of having a peak of medieval life. Recognizing that it may require some extra effort for climbing and enjoying the site I thing that it will payback.",
          "Arrived just in time for the 1400h lover's show. Wow! Really good stuff. It's all in French, but you can follow along well enough if you don't speak it. Sword fighting, acrobats, history of the castle woven into an entertaining little 20 minute show with the castle as the",
          "The castle ruins and grounds are amazing to visit. Winding up through a touristy village, you come to a windswept hilltop fortress where you can explore the grounds in relative peace and quiet. Awe-inspiring views of the area.",
          "The entrance fee was totally worth it. I had no idea there was so much to see in the chateau. It is really a whole town up there, and we spent over two hours looking around. It was a Monday and not particularly crowded, but the area is pretty large anyway to spread people",
          "Provence is associated with warm, sunny weather. We visited mid-June under a dark cloudy sky, strong wind and intermittent showers. This had two effects: it cleared the ranks of the visitors and it stressed the haunted quality of these monolithic stone walls. There was still an",
          "Loved this place! It's gorgeous, and the medieval town was very enchanting as well. This place is like a playground for kids and grown ups. The views from the chateau are also stunning. We arrived around 3:30 pm and it was not very crowded. By the time we left, around 4:30pm it",
          "Great place to visit but during the day we were there it was stuffed to overflowing with tourists and so stiffling we had to get out. But we went back in the evening and it was lovely.",
          "I really enjoyed the Chateau. It was pretty easy to get to and the little town bellow is really cute. The audio guide is excellent and they had many languages to choose from including English. The price to get in was \u20ac10 which included the audio guide. However, it's very hot",
          "The demonstrations are a little corny, especially the dueling, but this is a great half day activity and well worth the cost. There are also soaring views of the country side and lower town below. Take plenty of water and snacks, as little is sold on the hilltop. Much of the",
          "Stunning view, nice collection of medieval weapons of war, beautiful remnants of the chateau. Good audioguide, though, don't listen to every item, it will take you to long :-)...",
          "fantastic views, wonderful history and some very good shops on the way up the hill!Its worth going early as school and coach trips build up after 11am. Some pretty little resturants a long the way too.",
          "A wonderful place to view the entire valley around this hill. It is a bit of a walk to the top of the castles, especially on a hot day.",
          "Unlike many a castle ruin, this one has history explained all through it, with catapults, descriptions of ruins, the lifestyle explained, the history of the castle. Clamber around but behave, it is in a natural state and that means worn steps, uneven flats, no hand rails and",
          "You can literally walk all over these ruins and climb to the top to get even more amazing views than the beautiful village of Les Baux offers. The info along the way is mostly in French, so if you don't speak that, pick up an audio guide. Their are a lot of rocky, slippery spots",
          "Beautiful vistas from the Chateau and the cliffs surrounding it. There is not much left to the Chateau, but there is an interesting interpretative trail showing the various weapons and Historic facts. A free audio guide is available at the entrance. Admission is not free. It is",
          "This place is enormous and towers above the beautiful village of Les Baux de Provence. You can climb high towers on ancient worn steps. You can wander over vast tracts of area right up to the edge of the cliff walls. They have various old fighting machines such as the Trabuchet.",
          "The climb up through the village and around the chateau is worth it for the incredible views and wonderful photo opportunities - one of the most stunning hilltop villages in the region.",
          "Want to see the ruins of a medieval castle? Want to see medieval siege weapons up close? Want to have a nice view? You get them all when you visit the Chateau. The audiioguide is a must since the castle is well preserved as it can be and an explanation is needed as you go",
          "After parking the car, trekking starts but worth it. Because a hill with breathtaking views await you. Roman theatre of Orange is 9,5 \u20ac and this castle 8\u20ac, it's ironic.",
          "Cost of just the Chateau was 10 euro , you can get a ticket combined for the Lumineres there as well which you must see. Back to the Chateau . On the day I visited the ruins which are simply magnificent there were demonstrations of all the old skills with people in traditional",
          "I'm traveling France for two weeks and hand down the best e perform e so far. The city and castle are beautiful and unique. A fun way to spend a day. Definitely worth the trek to get here.",
          "This was our first Provence stop on a tour from Marseille. So much to see and do that we could have easily spent the whole day here. The village/fort has been faithfully restored and offers a fascinating insight into life in this region in the middle ages. The fabulous Carriers",
          "The drive there is already wonderful and it's a good place to explore for a couple of hours. Entry to the actual chateau is \u20ac10 however walking all around the old town area will give you the same views. We did enter the chateau and climbed the old ruins and wander around.",
          "Over 4000 years of inhabitants to the hilltop. Amazing and you must visit to see why. From 2000 year BC to the Romans to every Medieval King and noble. I can see why.",
          "There isn't a lot left of the ruined Chateau itself but the location and situation of what remains makes this a must see when visitng this glorious little village. Beautiful views over the vineyards and fields and the village roofs - great for photographers - but climb at least",
          "This is a fantastic hill-top castle. Included in the entry price is an audio guide, which is well worth having. The castle covers a large area, but take your time. We went right first, past the reconstructed medieval war machines, and then back to the other end where you can",
          "After visiting Carcassone the day before, and feeling how touristic it was, we were a bit gun shy for Les Baux. What a difference!!! The integrity of the Medieval town has remained, with just a few shops scattered throughout. No giant flags, cheap dolls and tee shirts. The top",
          "If you don't want to have to walk up the hill for half a mile, get there early but get there you must. Lovely ancient town full of shops and restaurants (and tourists) with some great viewing places looking out over the Provence countryside.",
          "Beautifully maintained village and church in this gem of a mountain top village in Provence near Saint Remy. Worth the hike up the mountain to enjoy the exceptional views.",
          "We climbed up the hill in the narrow and beautiful streets, enjoying the old houses and courtyards. At the top we bought a combined ticket for the chateau and Carrieres de Lumieres (recommended) . The view is outstanding, and we enjoyed watching the craftsman doing medieval",
          "Following the audio guide, it is a lot of walking and takes a while, but is truly worth it. You get a perspective of what life was back while having to defend your home. Beautiful views from the top.",

          "We enjoyed walking round the medieval town and marvelling at the fact that when it was built all the water had to be hauled up the hill. There are some great views across the countryside. The small church is worth a visit especially for the contrast between the age of the",
          "Stroll along narrow cobble-stoned streets of this charming village on a rocky bluff and take in the fabulous views of the surrounding valley. Peek inside multiple little shops and stop for a meal in one of the cafes. Step into the Penitents Chapel and St. Vincent's Church -",

          "This is a cute medieval Provence fortified hill town. There are many of these but this is a place that a family will love. Paying to go in the castle and one can watch various medieval war machines put to use. And then the bonus is that there's a great view of the region from",
          "The drive thru St. Remy was beautiful.......so very French! Love the 'working' village that surrounds the Chateau. But for me the best part was seeing imprints of sea shells imbedded in the huge stones at the top of the mountain. Hard to believe that it was all once under the",
          "Sited on a spur of rock in the midst of the Alpilles over looking the 17 th C village of Baux, is the remains of 13 C great castle of the Lords of Baux. The hike uphill through the village is steep but worth it for the sweeping views across vineyards and olive groves once you",

          "We, family with young children ,visited the castle last week. There are few steps and a walk through a quaint village. The village has a few restaurants serving fresh local produce, cosmetics, herbs and local delicacies. We spent an hour and shopping and tasted some of the",

          "We visited this town on 25th of December on our way from Avignon back to Gerona. All other days this place is overcrowded but definitely worth visiting especially on sunsets. Kids were happy to see medieval assault machines in the castles but my wife was astonished with",
          "The chateau is worth the visit. Through it, you can see the whole town of Baux de Provence, amazing!",
          "Worth to visit if you have about 2-3 hrs time, Audio guides available, On territory there is a picnic zone so you can have lunch over there",
          "This place is really special, I would recommend it to anyone able to do a bit of walking and climbing. Huge castle walls, largely intact since medieval times, that the tour path leads you around, through, and on top. The audio tour was very informative and helpful, gave info on",
          "The castle was in ruins but it was so suggestive! The stonework was built on and sometimes incorporated in the rock, but it was such a soft rock that time, weather and war eroded bits and pieces. Amazing view",
          "Everything is beautiful in France but some places are more beautiful than others.The charm of arriving to this place is a pleasure in itself. In some places a tourist trap and could be tiring in the scorching heat of the summer but this is certainly a unique location.",
          "If you listen to all of the information on the audio guide it will take you several hours to walk round the ruins but it was very interesting. Parking gets very busy but one good thing is that you can take your dog with you round the castle. Amazing panoramic views for miles.",
          "Historical ruins that are facinating and fun to explore. My husband and I heard of this place so decided to check out on our way from Arles to Aix. We arrived early in the morning to get a good parking place and were pleasantly surprised to find a village below the chateau",
          "Although some members of our \"team\" weren't feeling too hot for this chateau experience it was still so worth it to go here. The view of the provence is amazing and this very authentic chateau was the best one we went to in our France travels. I thought that for the money it",
          "There's no lying, this is a tourist trap, apparently only three people still live here, and we had the wonderful luck of arriving on someone's wedding day, which made the parking lot real fun to navigate. The village is on a hill, so ideally you want to get parking right at the",

          "Quaint town that gets very busy so arrive early as the streets are very narrow. Full of touristy shops and restaurants/cafes. The Chateau is worth a look and has a very informative audioguide. It has beautiful views. Included in the price is the light show Carrieres de",

          "Les Baux is justifiably popular and thankfully, was not too crowded on the day we visited. We rented audioguides for the chateaux, and they were the best of any that we used throughout our trip. A huge amount of information is provided, but you can listen to as much or as little",
          "Probably one of the most awesome mountain village in Provence. Tip: get in very early ( before 11am) to beat the crowds.",
          "Do not tour this area without taking advantage of the audio tour. The commentary is a great tour of what happened in the day, the history of each building, the use and construction of the weapons (trebuchet, catapult, battering ram, etc.). And definitely tour the entire castle",
          "Ch\u00e2teaux Baux-de-Provence in Les Baux is a very interesting site, and has some breathtaking views. It was built in the 10th century and shows some great areas of the chateau on the walk through. It also features some medieval weaponry such as catapults and explains how they work",

          "It's a nice chateau but is for the most part in ruins. It has a nice display of ancient arms and catapults that may interest kids. The village itself is very nice and is great for a stroll in the streets. The view from the chateau is worth the climb.",
          "The castle itself is mostly ruins, but the audioguide explains and illustrates everything quite well. The view is fantastic. The day we visited the wind was very strong, so beware of walking too close to the edge.",
          "Les Baux occupies a unique place in the early history of mankind in this part of the world. From the first troglodyte residents to the later people who built the village, this mountain top is a vantage point whose ownership has been hotly contested. This is a spectacular place",
          "if time is short, go with Carrieres de Lumieres which is a 10 minute walk from the Chateau des Baux de Provence. You can get a combo ticket for both but whereas Lumbers is a unique experience, although Chateau is nice, it is not much different than other chateaus around the",

          "If you had to pick one hill town to visit in Provence, Le Baux (and the chateau walk) should be on your short list. An opportunity to muse on what it must have been like to live in the middle ages. And see how the populace adapted to the terrain to survive.",
          "This 12th century village features a Chateau at the top. It is of course in ruins but it has great replicas of the types of machinery used to invade castles. I recommend getting the audioguides which come with the price of admission. Here you can buy a combination ticket to see",
          "My husband & I enjoyed visiting this most unique city up in the hillside of Provence, France last month. We enjoyed our walking tour first and were thankful our tour guide was very passionate as she shared with us all the amazing history of this city! We were also able to enter",
          "Has the best electronic guide of any of the sites. The air smelled heavenly - wild flowers and lavender.",
          "This is not a cozy little chateaux which we can find many in Europe. I felt and thought about how those people lived up in the mountain to protect and survive. When I got up a watchtower, I saw truly magnificent view of Provence and understood why they built the fortress there.",

          "The people of Les-Baux-de-Provence have taken what could be a very interesting attraction and turned it into a tourist trap of souvenir shops and food stands. Yes, there is an audio tour of the town that one can take, but it plays second fiddle to the attempt to part tourists",
          "We visited the castle after an extraordinary visit to Carrieres de Lumieres. The day was beautiful and the views were spectacular. Les Baux itself is a site to see. As other reviewers have said, being here gives an excellent perspective on Provence: the Alpilles, the olive",

You can purchase tickets for both attractions together and save a little. Be forewarned that you may drive around for parking",

          "The site is fantastic. Allows you to walk on the bridge and get up close to it. If you like to learn the details about the bridge the museum is well laid out and worth the visit. Lunch on site was very good and not overly expensive. Lots of walking paths around the site",

        "wiki": "Thoronet Abbey (French: L'abbaye du Thoronet) is a former Cistercian abbey built in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century, now restored as a museum. It is sited between the towns of Draguignan and Brignoles in the Var Department of Provence, in southeast France.  It is one of the three Cistercian abbeys in Provence, along with the S\u00e9nanque Abbey and Silvacane, that together are known as \"the Three Sisters of Provence.\"\nThoronet Abbey is one of the best examples of the spirit of the Cistercian order. Even the acoustics of the church imposed a certain discipline upon the monks; because of the stone walls, which created a long echo, the monks were forced to sing slowly and perfectly together.\n\n\n== Chronology of Thoronet Abbey ==\n1098 - Founding of the first Cistercian monastery at C\u00eeteaux, near Dijon, in Burgundy, by Robert de Molesme.\n1136 - A group of Cistercian monks from the Abbey of Mazan, a \"granddaughter\" of the monastery at Citeaux, found a new monastery called Notre-dame-des-Flori\u00e9ges, in the Var region.\n1140 - Raimond and Etienne des Baux donate land for a new monastery in a remote mountain valley 45 kilometers northwest of Fr\u00e9jus.\nabout 1157 The monks move from Flori\u00e9ges to Le Thoronet\nabout 1176 to 1200 Construction of the monastery\n1176 - Alphonse I, the Count of Provence, confirms the Abbey property.\n1199 - the troubadour Folquet de Marseille becomes Abbot of Le Thoronet.\n1785 - The Abbey is declared bankrupt and secularized.\n1791  A sale of Abbey property is announced -\n1840    Thoronet Abbey is one of the first buildings in France to be classified an historical monument.\n1841 - Restoration of the monastery begins.\n1854  - the French Government purchases the cloister and monks quarters.\n 1938 - the rest of the monastery is purchased by the French Government.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1098 Robert de Molesme founded a \"new monastery\" at C\u00eeteaux in Burgundy, as a reaction to what he saw as the excessive luxury and decoration of Benedictine monasteries, under the direction of Cluny.  He called for a stricter observance of the Rule of St Benedict, written in the 6th century,  and a sober aesthetic which emphasized volume, light, and fine masonry, eliminating the distraction of details.Under Bernard of Clairvaux, the Cistercian Order began a rapid expansion.  By the time of his death in 1154, there were 280 Cistercian monasteries in France - by the end of the 12th century, over 500.\nThe first Cistercian community in Provence had settled at Notre-Dame de Florielle, on the Florieyes river near Tourtour. where they had been given land by the local lords of Castellane.  The first site apparently was not satisfactory for their system of agriculture, so in about 1157 they moved twenty-five kilometers south, to land they already owned at Le Thoronet.  The new site had the advantages of more fertile lands, several streams and a spring.\nIt is not known exactly when the monastery was built, but work was probably underway in 1176, when the title to the property was confirmed by the Count of Provence. The entire monastery was built at once, which helps explain its unusual architectural unity. The church was probably built first, at the end of the 12th century, followed by the rest of the monastery in the early 13th century.\nThe first known abbot of le Thoronet was Folquet de Marseille, elected in 1199. Born about 1150 into a family of Genoese merchants, he had a remarkable career, first as a troubadour, a composer and singer of secular love songs, who was famous throughout medieval Europe. In 1195 he left his musical career and became a monk, then abbot, then, in 1205, the Bishop of Toulouse. Less than a century after his death, Dante honored him by placing him as one of the inhabitants of Paradise, in Paradiso Canto IX.In the 13th century, there were no more than twenty-five monks in the monastery, but money came in from donations, and the Abbey owned extensive lands between upper Provence and the Mediterranean coast. The most important industry for the monastery was raising cattle and sheep. The meat was sold on the local market, and the skins of sheep were used for making parchment, which was used in the scriptorium of the monastery.  The Abbey also operated salt ponds at Hy\u00e8res, and fisheries on the coast at Martigues, Hy\u00e8res and Saint-Maxime. Fish that was not required at the Abbey was sold on the local market.\nMuch of the farming and administration was done by the lay brothers, monks drawn from a lower social class, who shared the  monastery with the choir monks, who were educated and often from noble families.  The lay brothers did not participate in the choir or in the decisions of the monastery, and slept in a separate building.\nBy the 14th century, the monastery was in decline. In 1328, the Abbot accused his own monks of trying to rob the local villagers, being only a few years after the Great Famine. In 1348, Provence was devastated again, this time by the Black Plague which further reduced the population. By 1433, there were only four monks living at Le Thoronet.\nIn the 14th century, the popes at Avignon began the practice of naming outsiders as the abbots of monasteries, held in commendam.  In the 15th century, this privilege was taken over by the kings of France, who often chose abbots for financial or political reasons.  The new abbots in commendam received a share of the monastery's income, but did not reside there. By the 16th century, while the abbey church was maintained, the other buildings were largely in ruins. The monastery was probably abandoned for a time during the Wars of Religion. \n\nIn the 18th century, the abbot decided the order's rules were too strict, and added decorative features, such as statues, a fountain. and an avenue of chestnut trees. The Abbey was deeply in debt, and in 1785, the abbot, who lived in Bourges, declared bankruptcy. Le Thoronet was deconsecrated in 1785, and the seven remaining monks moved to other churches or monasteries. The building was to be sold in 1791, but the state officials in charge of the sale declared that the church, cemetery, fountain and row of chestnut trees were \"treasures of art and architecture\", which should remain \"the Property of the Nation.\"  The rest of the monastery buildings and lands were sold.\nIn 1840, the ruined buildings came to the attention of Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, a writer and the first official inspector of monuments. It was entered onto the first list of French Monuments historiques, and restoration of the church and bell tower began in 1841.  In 1854 the state bought the cloister, chapter-house, courtyard and dormitory, and in 1938, bought the remaining parts of the monastery still in private ownership.\nSince 1978, the members of a religious order, the Sisters of Bethlehem, have been celebrating Sunday Mass in the abbey.\n\n\n== The Abbey buildings ==\nFollowing the Rule of St. Benedict,  Thoronet Abbey was designed to be an autonomous community, taking care of all of its own needs. The monks lived isolated in the center of this community, where access by laymen was strictly forbidden.\nThe design of the Abbey was an expression of the religious beliefs of the Cistercians.  It used the most basic and pure elements;  rock, light, and water, to create an austere,  pure and simple world for the monks who inhabited it. The placement of the church literally atop a rock symbolized the precept of building upon strong faith.  The simplicity of the design was supposed to inspire a simple life, and the avoidance of distractions.\nThe Abbey was constructed of plainly-cut stones taken from a quarry close by.  All the stones were the same kind and colour and matched the stony ground around the church, giving a harmony to the ensemble. The stones were carefully cut and placed to provide smooth ashlar surfaces, to avoid any flaws or visual distractions.\nThe water supply was a crucial factor for the Cistercian monks;  it was used for drinking and cooking, for powering the mill, and for religious ceremonies, such as the mandatum, which took place once a week.  The monks devised an ingenious water system, which probably provided running water in the kitchen and for the fountains where the monks washed, as well as pure water for religious ceremonies.\n\n\n=== The Abbey Church ===\n\nThe Abbey church is placed on the highest point of the site, and is in the form of a Latin cross, about forty metres long and twenty metres wide, oriented east-west, with the choir and altar at the east end, as is usual. The exterior is perfectly plain, with no decoration.  Since only the monks were permitted inside, there is no monumental entrance, but only two simple doors, for the lay brothers on the left and the monks on the right.\nThe door for the monks was known as the \"Door of the Dead\", for the bodies of monks who had died were taken out through this door after a mass.  They were first placed on a depositoire, a long shelf by the south wall, then buried directly in the earth of the cemetery.\nThe simple bell tower was probably constructed between 1170 and 1180, and is more than thirty meters high. Order rules prohibited bell towers of stone or of immoderate height, but exceptions were made in Provence, where Mistral winds blew away more fragile wooden structures.\nInside, the church consists of a main nave with three bays covered with a pointed barrel vault, and two side aisles.  The arches supporting the vault rest upon half-columns, which rest upon carefully carved stone bases about two meters halfway up the walls of the nave.\n\nThe choir at the eastern end finishes with a half-dome vaulted apse with three semicircular arched windows, symbolizing the Trinity.  Three arcades in the nave give access to the other parts of the building. There are two small chapels in the apses of the transept, aligned the same way as the main sanctuary, as in the Cistercian abbeys of C\u00eeteaux and Clairvaux.\nThe chevet of the Abbey, the semi-circular space behind the altar, has no decoration, but the refinement of the workmanship, as well as the perfectly rounded form, was itself an expression of the religious ideas of the Cistercians.  The circle was supposed to approach the perfection of the divine, as opposed to the square, which belonged in the secular world.The three windows in the apse, the round oculus above, draw attention to the altar. Facing east, they catch the first morning light, and face the same direction from which Christ was expected to return to earth. They and the  four small windows in the transept let in just enough light to give life to the stone inside, particularly at the time of the sunrise and sunset, which were also the times of the most important religious services, lauds and vespers. The light coming through the windows changed the color of the stone and created slowly moving shapes of darkness and light, marking the passage of time, the essential element of the life in the monastery.\nThe pale stained-glass windows date to 1935 - they were recreated following the model of 12th-century stained glass from Obazine Abbey in the Corr\u00e8ze.\n\n\n=== The Monks' Building ===\nThe monks building is located to the north of the church, and is connected to it by stairways, which allowed the monks direct access to services. \n\nThe dormitory is on the upper floor of the monks' building.  The abbot had a separate cell on the left side, up a short stairway. The dormitory was lit by rows of semicircular windows.  A monk slept in front of each window.\nThe Sacristy, a room two meters high, three meters wide and four meters long, with a single window, built against the church transept, was where the church vestments and sacred vestments were kept. It had direct access to the church through a door into the transept.  The Sacristan was in charge of the treasury of the Abbey, rang the dormitory bell for the night services, and climbed to the roof to make astronomical observations to determine the exact time for religious services, depending upon the season.\n\nThe armarium (library) is a three-meter by three-meter room on the lower level of the monks' building, opening onto the cloister. The armarium contained the secular books used regularly by the monks.  It is believed that it contained books of medicine, geometry, music, astrology, and the classical works of Aristotle, Ovid, Horace and Plato.\n\nThe Chapter House, or The Capitulary Hall, was the room where the monks met daily for a reading of one chapter of the rule of St. Benedict, and to discuss community issues.  Election of new abbots also took place in this room. Its architecture - with cross-ribbed vaults resting on two columns with decorated capitals, was the most refined in the monastery, and showed the influence of the new Gothic style.  The walls and columns date to about 1170, the vaulting to 1200-1240.\nDuring the reading of the Rule and discussions, the monks were seated upon wooden benches, and the Abbot was seated at the east, facing the entry.  The main sculptural element is a simple cross of the order on the south column, before which the monks would bow briefly. A hand holding a cross, the symbol of authority of the abbot, is sculpted on the capital of the north column. He was sometimes buried in this room, so that after death his memory would add to the authority of the living abbot.\nThe Hall of the Monks, was at the north end of the monks' building, but fell into ruins, and little remains. The room was used for making clothing, as a workshop, for the training of the new monks, and as a scriptorium, the room where manuscripts were written, since it was the only heated room in the abbey.\n\n\n=== The Cloister ===\n\nThe cloister, in the middle of the monastery, was the center of monastery life.  It measures about thirty meters on a side, is in the shape of an elongated trapezoid, and follows the terrain, sloping downward from the monks' building toward the river. Despite its odd shape, and its location on very uneven ground, it manages to maintain its architectural unity, and to blend with its natural environment; in some places the rock of the hillside becomes part of the architecture.  \n\nConstruction began in 1175, making the cloister of Thoronet one of the oldest existing Cistercian cloisters. The south gallery is the oldest, followed by the east gallery, next to the chapter house, which has a more modern slightly pointed barrel vault ceiling. The construction was completed by the north gallery, beside the former  refectory, and the west gallery. At a later date a second level of galleries was built, also since disappeared.\nThe thick walls of the galleries, their double arcades, the simple round  openings over each central column, and the plain capitals give the cloister a particular power and simplicity.\n\nA lavabo, or washing fountain, stands in the cloister in front of what had been the entrance to the refectory. It is placed in its own hexagonal structure, with a ribbed vault roof.  The water came  from a nearby spring, and was used by the monks for washing, shaving, tonsure, and doing laundry.  The lavabo is a reconstruction, based on a fragment of the original central basin.\n\n\n=== The former North Wing ===\nThe north wing of a Cistercian monastery, facing the church, traditionally contains the refectory (dining room), the kitchens and the calefactory, or heated sitting room. The north wing fell into ruins and was abandoned in 1791.\n\n\n=== Building for Lay Brothers ===\nThe wing of the monastery for the lay brothers dates to the thirteenth century, well after the other buildings.  The building was two stories high, with a dining room on the ground floor and a dormitory above. Two arches of the building cross the Tombareu River. The latrines were located in this part of the building.\n\n\n=== The Cellar ===\nThe cellar is a long rectangular room attached to the east gallery of the cloister.  This building has undergone numerous remodelings, and is no longer its original shape.  In the sixteenth century it was turned into a wine cellar, and the wine presses can still be seen.\n\n\n== Le Thoronet and Le Corbusier ==\nThoronet Abbey had a significant influence upon the Swiss architect Le Corbusier  Following the Second World War, Father Couturier, a Dominican priest and artist, who had contacts with contemporary artists Marc Chagall, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard, invited Le Corbusier to design a convent at La Tourette, close to Lyon.   Father Coutourier wrote to Le Corbusier in 1953:  \"I hope that you can go to Le Thoronet, and that you will like that place. It seems to me that there you will find the essence of what a monastery must have been like at the time it was built; a place where men lived by a vow of silence, devoted themselves to reflection and meditation and a communal life which has not changed very much over time.\"  Le Corbusier visited Thoronet, and wrote an article about his visit, including the observation,  \"the light and the shadow are the loudspeakers of this architecture of truth.\" The convent that he eventually built has a number of features inspired by Thoronet, including the tower and the simple volumes, and the alternating full and empty spaces created by bright light falling on the walls.\n\n\n== The Influence of Le Thoronet ==\nThe British architect John Pawson also used Thoronet as an inspiration for the cistercian abbey of Novy Dvur in the Czech Republic (2004).\nLe Thoronet was a source of inspiration for the Belgian poet Henry Bauchau (born 1913), who published in 1966 La Pierre Sans Chagrin.\nIn 1964, the French architect Fernand Pouillon published Les pierres sauvages, an historical novel in the form of the journal of a master worker at the abbey. It won the prix des Deux Magots (1965) and was praised by Umberto Eco as \"a fascinating contribution to the understanding of the Middle Ages.\"\n\n\n== Sources and citations ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nDamien Poisblaud\nS\u00e9nanque Abbey\nSilvacane Abbey\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPouillon, Fernand, 1964.

          "We started our walk by the Village of the Bories and followed the paths that first led to a overhang that the Resistance has used and then along a deserted valley that led to Senanque. As it was raining hard we went back and drove to the Abbey and began the walk in the other",
          "Tour of Provence from Avignon stopped here to admire the lavender fields. The fields were like rays of violet reaching for miles. Visited in early July.",
          "It was a shame to have missed the lavender in bloom but our fault for visiting too late in the season. Was still picturesque and enjoyed our visit.",
          "The abbey itself is mildly interesting but not worth more than 30 mins travel . The tour guides think it is acceptable to loudly scold anyone making any noise near them in spite of their own booming voices ruining any serenity. I can't recommend the place.",
          "Not my first visit (that was in 1970) but probably my last. This is now a hugely successful commercial enterprise -- but the magic is gone. Our French language tour was spoiled by the constant noise from other participants, which the guide did nothing to curb. The acoustics in",
          "to be honest its a bit dissapointing. we have seen clearly more beautiful and more intriguing abbeys. here they focus a lot on sales of dozens of souvenirs...",
          "The setting for the abbey makes it one of the most photographed abbeys in France, especially during lavender season. The monks make products which they sell in the shop located in the abbey. Love the lavender body lotion!",
          "We got the guided tour in French and our guide was simply wonderful, enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. They have tours at specific times. The grounds are well preserved, the bookstore on the first floor and the souvenir boutique on the ground floor with many products from",
          "Nice abbey in a valley. You should go there in June when the flowers will be pink. A must see in the provence!",
          "So we visited after the lavender was harvested...not the peak time to come to the Abbey in October. None the less the grounds are nice and the gift shop is fantastic. They carry many different lavender products.",
          "Beautiful property and a really fun augmented reality tour but the highlight for me was the gift shop!",
          "A beautiful place of full of atmosphere and tranquility. Better than the more publicised Musee de lavande. Here you get to experience the true lives led by the monks, and how they farm the surrounding expanse of lavender fields.",
          "The last time for the guided tour is 4:15 for guided tour, and 10:15 for the unguided tour. We enjoyed the guided tour - excellent and informative. Since this is an active monastery, there will be times when tours are not available - need to check in advance if you are",
          "Stunning historical site with beautiful architectural details, extra bonus if you can go when Lavender is in bloom",
          "The setting is great. The building a clear example of Cistercian arquitectura. The guided visit is recommended.",
          "While we didn't go into the Abbaye- we enjoyed taking photos of the lavender field in front - it was a beautiful setting!",
          "Even if capturing the perfect Instagram picture here is not quite doable, the abbey is still a gorgeous, quiet site in a gorgeous setting. Walking around the grounds (for free) and smelling the lavender was worth the drive. If you do drive, be sure to plan your route in",
          "If the reason for your visit is to get a great picture of lavender fields with the Abbey in the background, you may be disappointed. I know it will be hard to talk you out of it after the pictures you've seen on the Internet. First, I'll assume you know that the lavender only",
          "I am French and will have hard time to talk negatively about this amazing monument... BUT seriously I have been extremely disappointed of how rude and impatient the staff was, just unhappy to be here, annoyed that you are asking questions and I could go on. \ud83d\ude21 Not even an",
          "Found the place extremely busy with Chinese tourists, who appeared oblivious to what was going on round them and trying to get the \u201clavender picture\u201d Shame the monument was like that Shop with normal tourist stuff, no cafe or food for tow tired cyclists",

          "When we visited the lavender had probably already been cropped a few times so we weren\u2019t able to experience the full beauty of the place. Also we unfortunately came when the monks were in prayer (11-13.30) so we couldn\u2019t visit the inside of the monastery. But we did enjoy our",
          "The abbey is lovely, but the number of people is overwhelming. Get there early and don\u2019t park on the road. There is parking by the abbey.

          "It\u2019s one of those things you can\u2019t avoid when going to Gordes and Provence. The views around the Abbey are possibly the best part. Go there at sunset!",
          "Viewed across lavender fields, it\u2019s a lovely setting but we found it very crowded & not as impressive as we expected. Like anywhere else it gets crowded during the tourist season, so try to arrive before the coach parties. We parked on the road which was somewhat congested &",
          "Get their early. I noticed some reviewers complaining about the crowds and touristy feel, but if you arrive early you can appreciate the beauty of the abbey and the grounds. You will not get the iconic photo of the lavender field in front of the abbey as the lavandin was",
          "The best thing about this place was the ample parking. The site itself was very underwhelming. It looks better in the photos than in real life. There are much more impressive lavender fields around Provence that you'll likely pass, so don't both driving to this site. The abbey",

          "We got up early on a Monday morning to attend Mass at the abbey. We arrived while the Cistercian monks were chanting the Divine Office before Mass. Only six men but they made a big sound aided by the acoustic properties of the arched ceiling of the Winter Chapel. Reverence",
          "We really only took a walk down to see the monastery. Could not tell you much about inside but if we had more time we would have went. You need to cover up clothing wise as to respect the expectations of dress. Worth a visit to see the lavender and position. Worth knowing",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit particularly when the lavender is in bloom. I would recommend getting there early i.e. Before 10am so it is not crowded and noisy. The iPads are good to use in the self guided tours available at certain times in the day. It is a shame that the",
          "If in Gordes, this is certainly worth visiting. The lavender landscape provides a beautiful setting for this abbey. The abbey itself was nice enough inside. We got the Histopads (iPad) to get the relevant history. This visit was pretty quick visit on the inside although we",
          "We arrived just before lavender was in bloom so no tourists! Abeautiful medieval abbey in a gorgeous setting beneath the mountain.",
          "If you're looking for a real provencal motive you must come here. Admidst lavender fields an old monastry. During the high season you should come here early or at late afternoon not be overrun. Still with all the people a romantic place.",
          "This abbey, deep down in the valley, is so full of history! A beautifully preserved building with very well presented information.",
          "The Abbaye is a major attraction in the region. The buildings are impressive, stark and solid, but the guided tour brings the story of the place and people alive. Well worth the visit.",
          "The lavender was just starting to show color when we visited in mid June and though it would have made the site look and smell spectacular, it was well worth the time to go there. The drive down the mountain to reach the Abbey is breathtaking as well as the trip out. I wish",
          "This is a must see stop when you are in Gordes. The abbey has been around for centuries and is still active. In front of the abbey are large groves of lavender that make for a beautiful photo opportunity. They also have a large gift shop if you are looking for souvenirs to take",
          "Would look pretty amazing in lavender blooming season. Outside this part of the year lot still seemed worthy of a quick stop to admire the age of the building which is much larger than I expected. Nice gift shop. We couldn\u2019t have been bothered to experience the French language",
          "In season the gardens are purple with lavender, our visit was out of season unfortunately. We didn't go inside because we were dressed for the sun, but entrance seems to be free of charge",
          "The sight features amazing history and a very nice ambiance. Note though that in August this is not the place to see the lavender in bloom, but still a nice sight to visit. Car park available. People are so nice and they greet you on the entrance.",
          "Amazing how they were able to build this almost 2000 years ago. Worth the visit and the small entrance fee.",
          "Photos of this beautiful Abbaye are often shown in literature about Provence. Its setting is lovely, in a small valley, down a curving road, surrounded by lavender fields. The lavender was just in bud when we were there. We were sorry to miss the lavender in full bloom, but a",
          "for all non-French speaking visitors the only time to visit is in the morning, you can also go around on your own. It's not large, would take max 30 mins to view it in detail. In the afternoon ONLY French speaking groups are allowed, takes 60 mins plus and you are locked in",
          "This one of the most iconic places to take photos in Provence of the lavender field with the Abbey in the background. You can park quite close to the Abbey there is a good size free car park so it is worth driving down the narrow road towards the Abbey as far as you can. The",

          "Notre-Dame de Senanque Abbey is, in my opinion, overrated. France, and Europe, is resplendent with castles, abbeys, monasteries, chateaus, and walled villages bursting with history. Many are more interesting, and much less crowded than the Abbey. This complex is very small.",
          "The iconic picture of Provence. Sure, its pretty but not amazingly pretty. THere are better lavender fields around the region and the abbey looks like most abbeys. The combination is pretty but not a reason for a serious detour. If you are in Gordes (amazing town) this is a stop",
          "We went to the Abbey to see the lavender field, and perhaps due to my high expectation, I was a bit disappointed by the sight. We parked along the road, because when we got there, there were already plenty of cars there. We took that as an indication that there was either no",
          "Despite the beautiful lavender fields, we were quite disappointed to not be able to actually go on the the fields and take some up close photos. There were many signs saying \u201cPRIVATE PROPERTY: WE CALL THE POLCE\u201d which just gave off an unwelcoming and hostile vibe. The gift shop",
          "We based ourselves in Aix en Provence, rented a car and drove around the area. On the day we visited Abbey of Senanque, it was a Sunday at around 2:30ish. We found a line of cars not turning inside for parking and they just parking along the road next to the entrance so we did",
          "We walked here from Gordes and back. It takes about an hour each way. I would not call the walk easy, but it isn\u2019t impossible either. Wear good shoes. The walk is well marked, maps are available in town. The Abbey is wonderful. It is peaceful and well marked. Admission price is",
          "It was beautiful and worth a visit, but the lavender is not really blooming. We were told that they just replanted the lavender so it will take a couple years to be in full bloom. Still beautiful! The gift shop is great and has wonderful snacks and local cheese",
          "This is worth a quick detour if you are in the area. We were extremely lucky to arrive at the height of lavender season. The above photo does not come close to doing justice to the beauty of the rich purple lavender fields that would be in the foreground in June/July.",
          "Great lavender fields, although they were a bit green when we visited. The abbey itself adds to the whole charm of the area, combined with the lavender. I agree with the other reviewers, skip the tour. I would strongly advise against buying a lot from the souvenir shop as it",
          "Obviously you need to check when it is in season, but if lavender is in season, this place is a great place to go! Beautiful setting, close to a really cute small town, worth the trip!",
          "We had an incredible, surreal experience, mass at 18.00 with the Cistercian Monks, beautiful! We visited end of June also expecting spectacular lavender fields at the Abbey, this wasn\u2019t the case on this occasion.",
          "We arrived around 3:30pm on a Weds and there was plenty of parking. Only one tour bus remained and the place was quite busy, so I can imagine how crowded it must be when there are several buses. The abbey is lovely and beautifully situated. If you arrive after 11am you must",
          "A very beautiful building in a beautiful setting. However, the abbey is sadly completely overrun with tourists. It takes about 30 minutes simply to drive into the car park, negotiating inch-wide gaps between your car and the tourist coach squeezing through past you. The visit",
          "It feels like the monks really don't want anything to do with the tourists... yet the souvenir shop is more like a department store! Hundredd of Chinese tourists buying a lot of things... Warning signs, walls and fences make it difficult to enjoy the premises. Decided not to do",
          "We decided to visit the abbaye on our day trip to Gordes. Unfortunately the lavender was not in bloom and we wanted to do the tour but it was only in French. Make sure to go later in summer and if you want an English tour go before 11:45am.",
          "At the bottom of a valley, a community of Cistercian monks has been working and praying in Senanque since the 12th century. The restoration of the abbey buildings continues to this day. The dormitory, cloister, church, warming room and chapter house are open to visitors most",
          "Beautiful ancient abbey with spectacular lavender when it is in bloom, which begins about mid June. Also, the walls of Gordes leading up to the Abbey (see photo 3) are spectacular all the time.",
          "The lavender doesn't come out until May, so we were a bit early, but this is such a classic landmark, a beautiful old abbey, still in use, in a beautiful valley. Worth the short trip if you are in the Luberon.",
          "Know what you want from this visit and plan accordingly. The last admission for unguided visits is at 11am. There are specific times for guided visits. Guided visits are available in French and English for adults, but only in French for children. The gift shop has some unique",
          "Visit the place in May, so the lavender fields are no full of flowers, but still a beautiful place. The church from Sec XII is big and simple. no luxurious like other churches in France, Italy or Spain. It is a simple and peaceful place.",
          "Really nice look at history and the way folks lived long time ago. Looks like it did from when it was built. Not crowded, off the path of the train people.",
          "A Cisterian Abbey near the village of Gordes. It was founded in 1148 under the patronage of Bishop of Cavaillon and Count of Provence. The abbey church was consecrated in 1178, later on the other structures were added like: cloister, dormitory and a chapter house. Today, the",
          "We have heard that it can be over-run with tourists, but we managed to see it is a calm and peaceful moment. We found it pure and elegant.",
          "This place is beyond beautiful. We unfortunately missed out on seeing the lavender in flower but it was still an amazing place to visit. The photos don\u2019t do it justice. Well worth the short trip out of town if you find yourself in Gordes.",
          "We past this place in May when we where in the area. If you are close by you can of course drop in and by some lavendel soap and look at the sounding environment, but it is not so much to see if the flowers are not in bloom. I would recommend to only visit this place curing that",
          "Dating from the twelfth century , this old Cistercian abbey is like stepping back in time . Largely reconstructed after being decimated by the Hugenots , and then the French Revolution , this is such in interesting window into monastic life . Incredibly picturesque , especially",
          "This abbey is a must when touring the area. It is a gorgeous peaceful part of the world! Even without he lavender in bloom, still worth the detour!",
          "We found this place by chance, in our way to have lunch at Gordes. It's a beautiful abbey, simple in its interior as an obbey must be, so nothing to see but plane architecture with nothing more to see. Tickets are at 7,5\u20ac/adult. I think they are pricey. I would rather buy some",
          "We scheduled a tour through the monastery that is scheduled on a very limited basis. The setting of the monastery is spectacular even when the surrounding fields of lavender are not in bloom. Our tour of about 10 people was given by a monk who was the real deal with the",
          "A very serene and peaceful place to visit. We are returning again in the Summer when the Lavender is in bloom.",
          "An off season visit to the Abbey is wonderful. The quietness of the secluded valley; the emptiness of the parking lot; the solitude in the large, empty rooms of this ancient building; the simplicity of the chapel; makes for a contemplative mood even if a short visit. In January,",
          "I have been here during summer while the lavender is in full blossom. Then it is packed here but now during winter time it was quiet, calm and very peaceful.",
          "Definitely a historical site. Never got the chance to enter inside the church but the view is amazing. I loved the lavender here. But beware of bees. I remember I got bitten by one of those when I was asleep and it hurts so much.",
          "a good time to visit is in evening around5.30 to 6.30 when most tourists are gone, it can be a bit overwelming during high season. a special experience it is to hear the monks chanting at a service which I was lucky enough to experience a couple times, around 11 am",
          "A tranquil oasis in a beautiful setting. Stroll the grounds, visit the large boutique, make a visit to the simple chapel next to the monk's dormitory. Absolutely worth the extra effort.",
          "I pay attention to recommendations from Michelin and noting a 3 star rating, I urged our travel companions to take a short detour from our Luberon village tour to see the Abbaye. The approach is scenic and well marked with a good parking area. A short walk leads to the Abbaye,",
          "I started with fairly low expectations: I don't really care about lavender and that was supposed to be the big attraction. Travelling through beautiful countryside helped my mood a lot. I was not disappointed to find that the lavender crop was long past-- it's a June crop and",
          "The abbey is in a little valley not far from Gordes. Nice drive down. Parking area was full of cars. Lavender fields in front of the abbey make for a pretty picture with the abbey in the back. In September the lavender plants were basically remnants of an earlier harvest.. not",
          "The way from Gordes is so picteresque that you might be disappointed by the view of rather simple architecture in grey shades (sure, lavender in blossom makes a difference!). Take some time to accomodate and you will enjoy the Abbey and the surroundings.",
          "Historical place that worth the visit along a local guide. Very educational tour, a must for the ones that love medieval history. Do not miss the very interesting bookstore.",
          "If you love lavender and you love old, churches or religious places, then this Abbaye is a must-visit. The drive down into the valley is spectacular in itself, as are the views as you sweep along the mountainside. The lavender fields leading up to the Abbaye are amazing and we",
          "The Abbaye was closed but we visited the store, great products. We also visited the church behind. Amazing place includes lavender fields.",
          "The view suddenly discovers the building down in the valley. This is a working monastery. The monks grow lavender, on a commercial basis, vegetables for their own consumption, and tourists are also a source of income. It is a huge building. You are not aloud to walk by",
          "We visited in mid-July when the lavender was fully in bloom, and it was one of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen. To get the best picture of the abbey with the lavender, stop and pull over prior to entering the parking lot. There is a chain link fence near an opening that",
          "It is well worth the 30, or so, minutes to wind the narrow road to visit the abbaye. The lavender fields are beautiful. Expect traffic and difficulty parking.",
          "Very scenic but very expensive to get inside. Without paying the huge price you could only walk around the outside and take a few pictures. Parking was free and the shop quite interesting. Not bad if you are in the area.",
          "Visited whilst staying in Gordesa - about 15 mn drive away; somewaht austere - arrived during mass - count 45 mn to viist the Abbey and the gift shop. A pleasant visit but nothing \"stupendous\" CP & CP Family",
          "Lovely setting, beautiful even in the rain and after the lavender has flowered! Interesting old abbey but the tour and all the interpretations are torally in French . The guide did not acknowledge the fact that we couldn't understand and didn't help us in anyway. If you are",
          "We visited 3 abbayes and this was the most authentic and only one still active. Beautifully restored buildings, with very engaged guides - ensure english version, if french is not your domain. Not big or vast, but authentic. Take time for the drive to the place (that is",
          "We were staying in Gordes and drove the 15 minutes drive to get there ( the road we took with the gps, was very narrow, had some cliffs and was both ways, although nothing to compare to the route near La Palud, but still frightening for 3 km.) On Sunday at around 13:00, the",
          "I rented a bike from our hotel La Bastide de Gordes and it is only a few km far from there . Very nice and specially in the end of June when the field of lavenders is in bloom .",

          "Stopped here in the afternoon. The only self guided.tours of the.abbey are in the morning. The afternoon tours are all guided and in French. Since we don't speak French, we decided to pass on the tour. Very reasonable cost though. Beautiful location. Lots of lavender in",
          "The region itself deserves 5+ stars. The Abbey was a bit crowded, the largest parts of the field were blocked off with a fence (to protect the flowers from the numerous tourists). It was a hot day and we had on shorts so we were not permitted in the Abbey but allowed on the",
          "what a beautiful place, surrounded by lavenders - smells so good and relaxing!! while walking the main path to the church, there is a \"hidden\" small lavender field on the left, just behind the bush, could take nice photos ;) would recommended to go late afternoon due to long day",
          "We enjoyed the view of the church. We went while the lavender was in bloom. I would recommend going first thing in the morning or close to the end of the day. The place was packed with tourists buses and I was a bit disappointed with the general lack of respect for a place of",
          "Beautiful old world church taken care by monks. Must visit in summer for the lavender effect and a picture perfect postcard.",
          "There must have been 500 people there when we visited but the tranquility of the place permeated everything. The lavender was stunning - time your visit carefully - and the abbey itself had a sense of peace and stillness. A great detour and not just for the stunning rows of",
          "Must go only when the lavender is in bloom and find out when they have services -- the Chants are amazing.",
          "We took the bus to Gordes in the morning, walked towards the abbey, and ended up catching a ride. Thank you, kind Chinese tourists! We skipped the tour of the interior, enjoyed the lavender on the exterior. We took advantage of their excellent book store and bathrooms. We found",
          "We were so fortunate to be in Provence when the lavender was in bloom. The setting is breathtaking. You do not have to spend money in the gift shop. Just go for the visual treat. Simply lovely!",
          "One of the nicest monastery that is hidden in the valley with many fields of lavanda, where you can enjoy the Provance",
          "Beautiful photographs to be had here. Nice bookstore/gift shop with some books in English which is hard to find in Provence!",
          "A must do while in the area. Bookstore with a few English books which is difficult to find otherwise.",
          "A tourist trap, for good reason. We visited in early July and the lavender was still in full bloom. Be careful to visit the website before you go as there are restrictions on when you can visit and do a self-guided tour. The shop has a large range of lavender products and",
          "Just outside Gordes, this is all the beauty of Provence in one site. The Abby is nestled in a valley surrounded by stunning green landscapes. The Abby itself is an amazing building and very simple in design, inside and out but still actively run by monks so makes for a quiet and",
          "We were on the hunt for lavender and this is the place to go to see the fields (small) in front of it. Very picturesque.",
          "We had only a brief time in this area. So glad this was what we chose. The lavender was in bloom....great walking around the area. The drive in was stunning",
          "It was nice pretty calm apart of hectic tourist plunging in lavender fields to take a photo despite of the sign \"no entry\", now I understand why monks had to put ugly fence around the majority of their beautiful lavender fields which spoils the beauty of it. It s a quiet place ,",
          "A very quiet and calm place. We opted for the visit with a tour guide. It was only available in French which led to a lot of chatter among the travelers that didn't speak the language, it was a little annoying for us that did want to listen. But the monastery itself is",
          "We hiked to the Abbey from our hotel and it was stunning to come upon. As we visited early in June, the lavender was not in full bloom. There was not a tour bus so it was not crowded. Unfortunately it was not open during the time we arrived and missed the full experience.",
          "Try to visit from late June to August, to get the full flavour of the lavender fields. Old buildings full of history, now with only a handful o monks living and working there. i do believe it is possible to do retreats there, and the atmosphere seemed very peaceful.",
          "I went just a bit early for full bloom of the lavenders and I knew that would happen. Some notes that I have not come across elsewhere. 1. For the photographers out there, I know you can't find an answer to what time of day. I went first thing in the morning (around 8am).",
          "The drive towards the Abbey showcased the ancient building beautifully with lavender fields in front of it. Our hearts dropped when we then saw the coaches in the busy car park. It was only 10.30am. We paid our 7.50 Euro entrance fee each only to find there was only access to",
          "We did not go into the Abbaye itself but drove over from St Remy hoping to see the lavender fields blooming. We were a little too early in the season for that, but our visit was still worth the drive. The views on the drive in from Gordes (one way traffic thankfully) on the",
          "Driving in is a bit hair raising, but we noticed that they have now stopped traffic going up the approach roadway, so it is not as bad a first thought. The lavender was starting to bloom and it was a very beautiful sight. We didn't do the conducted tour, as it was only in",
          "Peaceful, beautiful and quiet describe this place close to the city of Gordes. We went late in the afternoon, the place was deserted and it was a treat just to walk around. The lavender fields were not yet in full bloom when we visited but we can imagine how much more beautiful",
          "The abbaye is for sure worth the drive from Gordes. For \u20ac7,5 you get entrance to this historic site, guided tour (in french only) included. The young female guide was very professional and knowledgeable about the history of the building and the monastary life in general. Her",
          "Nestled in the george above Gordes, Abbaye Notre-Dame de Senanque is a quiet and peaceful Abbaye with calmness and solitude. The shop/bookstore offer a wide selection and it seem that it has kept quite a bit of its heritage away from the main tourist trap offers. I biked over",
          "This 12th century abbey is iconic when the lavender fields surrounding it are in bloom. When not, it is a little bit of a let down. There is a winding, narrow, treacherous road to travel to get there, but once there you are at the site of many a travel brochure. Schedule to",
          "How is it that we encountered our first EXTREMELY rude French(women) at a Cistercian Abbey?!?! We are a devout Catholic family and we're treated with the utmost disrespect at the Abbey. Our entire day was planned around visiting the Abbey and this was a great disappointment. We",
          "Although the access to the abbey is at times scary (very narrow road, no fence), we did not regret our decision to visit the abbey we had seen in pictures of Provence so often. It is located in a very secluded valley where nothing disturbs the peace of the place except a little",
          "Very famous for the lavender fields but also the church is very interesting. Very quiet and well preserved",
          "Super pretty abby. We were a few weeks too early for the lavender but I can imagine it to be super gorgeous. Definitely worth a visit whilst visiting Gordes.",
          "If you are happen to be in Gordes, France, you should find time to visit the Senanque Abbey, it is just 5 kilos meter away from the Gordes. This 12 century abbey is an amazing not only the story of itself, but it is also the fascinating architecture which is really worth to see",
          "The aroma of lavender was exhilarating! A wedding shoot was taking place for a magazine and it was delightful to see the bride with her flowing veil in the midst of the fields of lavender. If you can, go near sunset. It's a magical place that's only enhanced by the glow of",
          "We visited in June and the fields of lavender were in full bloom in some areas and not quite ready in others. The structure is gorgeous and a beautiful place to explore! The parking lot is small and it was quite crowded but we were glad we made a pitstop on our way to Gordes!",
          "Senanque Abbey is my most favourite place in the world. It is absolutely spectacular and is surrounded by such a calming, peaceful feeling. I attended Mass on Sunday morning, it will always be a memory to treasure.",
          "The abbey is more impressive on the outside than inside in my opinion. Lovely setting. Short walk from parking lot. A little steep in price for what you get to see.",
          "a picture postcard of a place. The lavender fields surrounding this amazing stone building. Try to catch a service of any kind - we went to Matens and witnessed the monks chanting",
          "when you first see the abbey, you can only be amazed from such a beauty... the spot , the lavender, the colour , the architecture outside and of course inside... And i I recommend to go to the shop where you can buy many things, like books of course but also lavender, honey,",
          "Through a narrow, winding mountain road you see beautiful fields of lavender and villages that are just not like anything else to experience.",
          "The abbey is know for its lavender fields. On this warm early October day the fields were not in bloom. The setting is beautiful and with no crowds, we took a leisurely walk around the grounds. There is a hiking path around the foothills that is both scenic and tranquil. The",
          "Definitely take the time to see the abbey which is probably at its best in the late spring and early summer when the lavender is in bloom. The architecture is astounding. Plan to be here on days when there are tours, and expect to stay for about an hour. Roads out of the nearby",
          "We visited the abbey today, expecting just to look around. We happened to arrive around 11:30, and Mass began at 11:45. It was amazing to participate in Mass with the monks. We may not have understood the French, but a great part about being Catholic is that it's the",
          "Good to visit in Lavender season but in October it's over. Just another old building. Bookshop is interesting for local produce by the monks",
          "The other reviewers are correct in pointing out that it is not very special unless the lavender is in bloom. They are also correct that unless you speak French you need to get there in the morning well before 11.00 in order to do a self guided tour. The organized tour from the",
          "We were here in June, a month too early to see the lavender in full bloom but it was still partially in bloom and so damn pretty! The gift shop was a bit tacky but was nice to find some authentic lavender oil to bring home.",
          "Just too touristy. Has lost its sense of place. Too many people. Too much commercial focus. Not enough focus on the peace of the place",
          "The journey from Gordes to the abbey is fine, not scary! The journey back from the abbey is so beautiful. We were there in July and the lavender was lovely. However, the abbey and surrounding countryside were so beautiful I would recommend it any time of the year. We went in",
          "It was a month late to see the best season for lavendar in August actually, however, we could see and smell the beautiful lavendar flower. FYI, to visit and enter cenotaphe, visiter should ware with long sleeves, long pants to respect this area. The climate is clear and cold.",
          "My wife and I visited here recently. We had been to the abbey 3 years ago when the lavender was in full bloom. This time in sept the lavender bloom was over. The abbey is picturesque and lovely. There is a fabulous gift shop available which is full of wonderful provincial",
          "Even when you visit after all the lavender was harvested, it is still unbelievably magical... Unique place of peace... Visit to nearby Gordes will complete the Proven\u00e7al fairytale...",
          "We visited the place too late to see lavender bushes flowering. Amazing place that looks like in 12th century. One already catches great views when appriaching from Gordes. This is Provance I have been looking for",
          "This beautiful stone abbey is lovely to look at, and in late June the lavender fields were in full bloom. It is crowded and over touristed but it is a modern icon, instantly recognizable, as much as the Eiffel Tower or Mont St Michel. You really can't come to Provence and not",
          "Located outside of Gordes, this is the classic view of the lavender fields and church photo that is seen in many publications. But in order to see the rich purple colors, the lavender blooms late June to mid July depending on the weather. You can view the outside without any",
          "Unfortunately when we were here, we had just missed the lavender but we could see how fantastic it would look when out in full. We had a look inside the Abbey which was lovely and peaceful and also really cool on a hot summer's day! Parking was free and the shop was well stocked",
          "Wow. We visited the Abbey as part of a tour to see the lavender. We were lucky in that there was a Mass taking place and we were able to view it. No words are spoken, only sung. Absolutely beautiful!!! There is something incredibly peaceful about this Abbey. Sadly, the",
          "One of the most stunning places to visit when the lavenders are in full bloom. Try to visit in the early hours of the morning when the hue of lavenders look the best and when the crowd is relatively low.",
          "Walked across the top of the hill from the campsite we were staying in above Gordes (Tip - don't do this on a windy day!!) to this stunning abbey. Unfortunately there were no tours when we arrived, but we were able to wander around and go inside the main church building.",
          "A pure architecture with no d\u00e9coration( except the lavender :-)) the best way for the monks to focus on prayer...A Real historical way of life",
          "We grabbed some baguettes from the boulangerie in Gordes and took the walking trail across the hill to the Abbey. Had lunch looking down over the Abbey and the lavender fields and only passed two other couples on the track. A lot of people at the Abbey as mid summer but worth a",
          "We went early in the morning, before it got crowded. The road down to the Abbey is quite curvy, steep, and small, so it is an adventure getting there. There are many places to see lavender in Provence, but seeing the Abbey in the background with the rows of lavender in bloom",
          "If you are not lucky enough to find parking at the church parking lot, be prepared for quite the walk. It is magnificent from the outside with all the Lavender in bloom and smells just wonderful! You are not aloud to walk in most of this but some on the left hand side is",
          "Lovely spot, great postcard style photo op's. We were there 2nd July and lavender was well in bloom.People are not allowed in the field directly in front of the Abbey, so nobody will spoil your photos. There's a free car park, then a short walk to the Abbey. There's a large gift",
          "We really enjoyed visiting. We arrived mid morning and although very busy, it definitely looked to be getting quite crazy when we were leaving so I think the earlier you can get here the better. Beautiful from the outside and in, it's well worth going in. In particular I loved",
          "It is a nice visit if you are already in the area. The setting is lovely but in our opinion lavender fields are more beautiful in the Sault region. There are really a lot of tourists and you can visit the abbey only in a 45 minutes long french tour. They should at least offer",
          "We did Gordes, Rousillon and Senanque Abbey in one day. It was a great day, I particulary took 556 photos, so, you get it :) We drove with a car, and here the parking was free, and to see an abbey from the outside you also don't pay a cent. Don't know about you, but I was",
          "If you are staying by Gordes, bring your comfiest non-slippery shoes and go for a hike! It is a gorgeous area and you will be able to enjoy the views much better by walking rather than driving the car.",
          "Brought a group of 30 here for photos with lavender/lavendine. The abbey and grounds are lovely. The drive in and out included some of the most striking views of villages and landscapes a visitor could hope to see.",
          "We went here from Aix En Provence. Lovely drive. The bonus was at the end here at the Abbey. We went in July...so I don't know if you are lucky throughout the year to see the lavender. Walk through the chapel. There is a tour you can take. Beautiful. Nice gift shop.",
          "Even though we missed the high season of lavender it was worth the 30 minute trip from Gordes to see the tranquil and peaceful setting.",
          "I cannot think of a more beautiful and remote setting for this Cistercian abbey. It's still functioning today. The monks support themselves by cultivating lavender (but it's still two more months before the rows of lavender blossom)",
          "We visited during blooming lavender season and jockeyed with the bus tours for some shots..fortunately no one can go too close to the iconic building so you can shoot with no bodies but not a relaxing place....worth a stop but during season be ready for the crowds.",
          "If you think that lavender is only for old lazy, think again: the abbey and its stunning settings are worth a stopover for sure. Avoid high season if possible.",
          "I have visited this Abbey once before. The first time we took a tour and I was enthralled with the history of this special place. Even today a small group of monks still inhabit the Abbey. The gift shop is full of natural products made by the monks such as their own lavender",
          "Overcrowded with tourists outside but once inside you can get a glimpse of the peaceful lives of the monks. Go early or late. People everywhere! Loved the tour. The guide was amazing. It was in French, but she took the time to speak with my wife and I and answer any",
          "One of the stops we had planned for the day in Provence and well worth the time and effort. The drive was scenic and fun. We visited the day before the Tour de France was going to be going through so there were people around setting up. The Abbey or as Google has it \"Abbaye",
          "This Abbey dating back many centuries is certainly worth a visit (definitely drive, it's not a short walk or cycle from Gordes) and the views a picturesque at the Abbey and on the way. Some time soon after our visit to this beautiful part of the south of France the Tour de",
          "Place itself is beautiful in July with lavender blooming. Try to come early in the morning, it gets very crowded later. We took a tour inside of the Abbey. It is in French and you get booklet in English. I really do not recommend to do it if you don't speak French.",
          "A real gem in Provence. Well worth a visit. A very tranquil place. I guess it can be busy at peak times. Watch out for the opening times.",
          "Unforgettable experience! This Abbey is worth visiting just to take the perfect Provence picture to frame it. You can take home the pictures and the aroma too, as the nice shop sells the oils. The lavender fields planted are very small, but the hues of purple and the smells are",
          "Really nice if you are there during the Lavender season. Not sure the visit would worth if the lavender field is not at its peak",
          "This abbay is in a perfect environment for retra\u00eete; its architecture from the 12-13th century and it is perfectly in the valley protected against the Mistral. Worderful to escape the hectic of modern life, and also to blind terror as seen recent in Nice. Enjoy the peace, the",
          "We came to the abbey in the evening when the sun was not very high in the sky. The lavender planted around abbey looks unreal. The purple hues and the aroma was dizzying. I couldn't get enough of this beauty. We just missed the last tourist bus so the site wasn't very crowded.",
          "The abbey has always been featured in travel photos because of the picturesque lavender fields in front of the abbey. We were a bit early in the lavender season but it was still a lovely scene to behold. We were there around 9am on a Sunday and there weren't a lot of visitors",
          "This place reminds me of those French movies we've watched which plot is an old abbey like. A lot of people made a mistake by saying that this is the place the movie, In the name of the rose, a 1986 film with Sean Connery and Christian Slater, yes, it was also a Cistercian",
          "We were very early to get into this place and very lucky that the road was done for new asphalt overlay, the lavender were not showing its amazing colors yet but the church will bring you the past magnificence and importance of this place, luckily, we watch and hear the priest",
          "Senanque Abbey is almost 40 km from Avignon downtown, better to have navigation to get there, especially when there's work in progress on the road and that part would be closed so u have to do a big tour via other roads. It's an old building, the lavender fields is just in the",
          "Absolutely breathtakingly amazing. The Lavender is simply beautiful and the Abbey so peaceful. Would go back in a heart beat. Early to mid July is the best time to visit as lavender is flowering.",
          "Our first stop on our lavender seeking mission - the Abbey has a few fields of lavandin. Unlike lavender which grows on higher ground, lavandin has a more punchy smell and deeper purple flowers and 3 strands of flowers on each stalk. The Abbey is a good place to visit to view",
          "We went to see the Abbey in its totality, not the lavender (I am sure there are many places to see lavender) the setting is superb, with cliffs rising behind the 12th century abbey. We were greeted by a lovely couple who asked whether we would like to make a request for the",
          "We wanted to see lavender fields, and were hitting the timing \"right\". When reading reviews, this kept coming up as the place to be. So we drove from Nimes up to the abbey. Crowded parking lots, RV's, tour buses etc. I am not sure if the blooms were not completely bloomed,",
          "We stopped by 2x during our visit to Provence. Once in the evening when the light wasn't right for pictures and again the next morning. We arrived before 10am and very rapidly the place filled up with buses and cars. Light is just perfect in the morning and wow the view is",

          "The best part of this place is the picturesque setting where you can take pictures of and with the lavender. The abbey is from the 12th century, so on its own it is interesting to see. We had a guided tour, which was broadly interesting. It is a typical abbey, which does not",
          "The actually abbey from inside isn't anything to write home about but the actual place from outside is magnificent and lovely for photos especially if you visit when the lavender field is in bloom",
          "The abbey has lavender planted all around. The lavender is currently young, so you don't have the postcard impact just yet. But it's still worth visiting, there is larger lavender right in front of the abbey and the setting is just amazing. Just a few minutes from Gordes.",
          "The abbey is hidden in a beautiful place. The streets to get there are VERY VERY thigh, small and a bit scary to drive. But you can handle. :) Try to do the tour, it is worth it.",
          "The Abbey is beautiful, set in a gorge down a winding wind, but the real reason for going is to see the lavender fields in late May/June. Go early-the car park soon fills up, with coaches as well as cars.",
          "But in mid June there was no any... Though they were blooming around. Sad though, i bet the view must be gorgeous! So be sure to visit not earlier than in July to see the whole picture:) The abbey itself is nicely situated, in the woods, easy to find from Gordes as there are",
          "Exciting road to get there, and a lot of tourists when we got there, but really a beautiful set of buildings and lavender fields. Lots of tourists on a Sunday afternoon. We skipped the tour, I think that was OK.",

          "As I am allergic to lavender, I am glad we went there before the lavender was in full bloom. We did the French guided tour (though we spoke no french) as that was the only way to go inside the Abbey. But the tour was way too long and we would have preferred to roam about",
          "Worth seeing if you are in the area. Most spectacular in July when lavender is in full glory but good any time. We biked there which was fun",

          "We missed the Lavender display this year, but I have enjoyed seeing them on other occasions and it is well worth planning a trip when they are in full bloom. We were however treated to the most biblical of downpours which trapped all the visitors in for an hour or so. It was an",

          "A beautiful serene place surrounded by lavender fields. During my visit, the lavender was in full bloom (July) and I was able to photograph this historic spiritual place in all its splendour. From Gordes it's a short drive to the Abbey and absolutely worth the trip.",

          "This is a truly beautiful spiritual place to visit.When the Lavender is out it is stunning but the place is also special at other times in the year - even Winter. My only problem was that the guided tour is only in French so not much use if you are not a speaker!",
          "Stopped here briefly on our way to Gordes for lunch but too late in the season for flowers. Still beautiful and tranquil sitting in a hidden valley.Didn't have time to wait for a tour but it's a very pleasant short walk from the car park to the abbey with very tasteful modern",

          "There is a lovely drive straight up D 543 which takes you on a well paved road through some lovely wine tour stops followed by the Abbey then on to the quaint artist town of Luberon. We enjoyed a wonder day of leisure with fall colors changing and the history of the Abbey",

          "Small abbey situated in the lavendel fields of the Provence deserves a visit. As little can be seen from the ouutside the guided tour is highly recommended.",

          "Spectacular setting, even if lavender is not in bloom. Wonderful Romanesque Abbey, though requires admission fee for tour of interior. Without tour, you can only enter gift shop and bathrooms. (Ladies toilets do not have seats.). Interesting food items sold in shop.",
          "The \"church\" is located basically in the middle of nowhere and that is why it is so spectacular. The surrounding area is very quiet and gives the place nice atmosphere. We visited this place at the end of the day so only the church and library/shop was opened. Recommend!",
          "The abbey offers a classic postcard scenery with the lavender field in front of the old medieval abbey.",
          "The Lavender had already been harvested, but the Abbey and surrounding grounds are lovely. Visited Gordes and Rousillon on the same day. Narrow winding roads, but no problem if you are careful not to hit any of the cyclists.",

          "My advice would be to skip it if the lavender has already been harvested. If you are still interested, go in the morning for a self guided tour. The tour was boring to say the least and the brochure that had different languages did not have 1/4 of what they were saying in",
          "Though we went in September 2014, and the lavenders were gone, this was still a harmonious post card perfect spot to tour, especially since the drive from Avignon was quite scenic. Should tour the interior and admire the Romanesque architecture. The large gift shop sells a wide",

          "As one of the reviewer pointed out; this could be a nice addition, if and only if you're visiting Gordes. Note that the blooming season for lavender is pretty narrow; except for that short season, I couldn't see any worth visiting the place. There's a parking lot, but it gets",
          "After a very scenic drive up to the mountain of Gordes, Enjoy the calm and peaceful atmosphere with beautiful lavender field. Take a lot of pictures, probably one of the best you will take in Provence. Do come early as the morning sunshine tune the whole scene in the right way.",

          "It's a long drive from Marseille to Abbaye Notre-Dame de S\u00e9nanque, but it really worth! The lavender fields here are very famous, so a lot of tour came here, We didn't visit inside, just bought some souvenir from the shop.",
          "Four of us took the inside tour. We were told it would be in French but that we would be given materials to describe what the tour guide was saying. We were given a small pamphlet that provided very little information. We didn't even always know what room we were in. I can speak",
          "Beyond an old abbey and some lavender fields, not much else to be honest. Fun watching people ignore every sign they put up (\"be quiet\", \"don't walk through the lavender fields\" etc etc).",
          "People come here in summer just to see the the lavenders and enjoy the beauty of them. There's also a tour for visiting inside the abbey, but we didn't join it because we didn't have enough time. There is a good souvenir shop which sells interesting things like lavender soaps,",
          "Just like in the photos, we were happy that we got to see the lavender in full bloom. We were there July 11th. We were staying in Lourmarin and it was about a 45 min drive due to small winding mountain roads. The drive down to the valley was beautiful as you saw Gordes in all",
          "there is not much to see and the visit turns to be very disappointing. the surroundings are nice though..",
          "This abbey is set between two mountains just outside Gordes. There are small lavender fields around it. The setting is absolutely tranquil and you feel as if you have been transported into a previous century. The building on the inside is very basic and not strewn with ornaments",
          "Remember that if you don't speak fluent French, last entry is at 11am to go around yourself. There isn't much info in the abbey and only a little leaflet to read so don't go expect to find out much about the abbey itself. The lavender also stops flowering by early/mid August.",
          "This abbey is well worth a visit, it is beautifully set between the hills, and has an interesting history. You can even buy veggies from their garden. You can do an organised tour of the abbey at set times, check their website.",
          "the lavender fields in July are beautiful, if you are driving there beware, road is very narrow along a cliffside and nail-biting, especially when when you meet a tour bus!",
          "IT Is nice from outside but It Is possible to visit only between 9,45 - 11,00. The rest of the day are some guidedntours in French only.",
          "We did the guided tour in the Abbey and my daugther find it a bit booring. But if you like history go anyway. What deserves to be seen is the Abbey in the summer, with the purple lavanda fiels , is amazing",
          "Excellent! We were staying in Avignon and then Aix en Provence and didn't realize the lavender fields were all the way two hours north, but this was just halfway and good enough for us. As a bonus there are some amazing restaurants nearby. The last turn is an easy one to miss",
          "The abbey building itself looks majestic when you stand in front of it, but if you are not staying at Gordes and abbey is out of your way to whatever else you plan to do that day - then it is okay to give it a miss. Most of the buildings are not accessible to viewers. I didn't",
          "We struck our for Senanque Abbey from Avignon first thing in the morning, and I am glad we did, as the crowds continued to build during our stay there. The Abbey itself is lovely, and situated in a secluded valley. The lavender out front was in full bloom, and scented the air",
          "We were here in late June, the lavender was in full bloom. The parking lot was full of tour buses and cars, and people were everywhere, clicking away (myself included :). The fields themselves are blocked off and that is brilliant, it allows us all to get that perfect photo of",
          "It's a beautiful place, but I have been there in the summer and there were many people around and a the store with so many expensive things. Totally different of my expectations. I thought I could see a peaceful and quiet scenery.",
          "Combine a visit to the lavender fiels with a trip to the village and market at Gordes. The best time to visit the Abbey is late June through July just before the harvest. The entire location is easily accessable, including the gift shop which sells any and all lavender items.",
          "Beautiful and serene place. We were lucky to be there in June - July when the lavender was in full bloom.",
          "This majestic old abbey is located in a hollow surrounded by green hills and lavender fields. It\u2019s impossible not to be moved by a sense of magnificence and tranquility, exactly what the monks (still living in there) were looking for. Don\u2019t miss the abbey tour (about 1h) and",
          "We visited the Abbey about 2 weeks ago. We went for the lavender and stayed for the tour. My husband speaks fluent French so I'm sure he enjoyed the tour more than my teenage daughter and I did, but our lack of interest may have been due to the temperature as well. It was",
          "For true inspiration and to be left in awe from the beauty and majestic feel of this place, you too will be moved emotionally by visiting this beautiful place. Great finds in their boutique store.",
          "Take a tour on your own to enjoy this abbey. Guided tours are in French. Great gift shop. Walk around the grounds on a nice day and enjoy the lavender fields. Pay attention to the columns in the courtyard, each is unique and done by many different stonemasons.",
          "I was so thrilled that our visit was at just the right time for the lavender to be in flower. Maybe one more week and the depth of colour would have been better but I saw this place with my own eyes, I smelled this place with my own nose and took my very own photo of it. Job",
          "The area surrounding the abbey are beautiful and well worth the trip. The lavender was about a week away from being peak color. We really enjoyed walking all around the abbey area but did not tour the actual abbey. It is a very beautiful and peaceful place, especially when",
          "This Cistercian Abbey, 5 km to Gordes is a still living monastery. It is dated backed to 12th century. There is a beautiful field of lavendry next to the Abbey where the view is fantastic at the blossomming season.",
          "Beautiful place- The Lavender fields are amazing. The drive down is a tight mountain road which needs some negotiating around vehicles heading in the opposite direction. Worth the effort, There was enough Lavender to make it spectacular perhaps August would give an even",
          "Look at the website before going to make sure of the schedule for the visits... You have the choice between a guided visit and a non guided visit, the price is the same and you have access to same thing. For the non guided they will provide a free tour map with information on",
          "The Abbey IS set in a secluded valley in the most stunning of settings, especially early July. I was there on 15 July 2015, when the Lavender grows right to the walls of the Abbey. However, for the very reason I wanted to see the Abbey with the Lavender so does every other",
          "Lovely place to visit but also very popular so come earlier rather than later. Parking is good but because it is a working Abbey there are no facilities on site.",

          "We hiked from Gordes all the way down to the Senanque Abbey through hills and the Provence garrigue. It was such a beautiful hike. The abbey is very well preserved and beautiful. People can actually stay there if they want (check on their website). Highly recommended!",
          "Semanque Abbey and its lavender fields is one of the bucket list stops. It is well worth braving the precarious road to get there. A word of advice: get there early to beat the convoys of tourist buses.",
          "A breathtaking view from the windy mountain road that approaches it, and a beautiful and tranquil abbey when you get done. A real experience that is hard to match. The lavender fields are the epitome of the Proven\u00e7al picture, and you can't fail to come away with some amazing",
          "We were primarily visiting the Abbey to see the lavender fields but were disappointed when we arrived to see they were not in full bloom and colored deep purple as we saw depicted. We may have been one or two weeks too early. The architecture of the abbey was worth a a few",
          "This is not to be missed. Though there are other great lavender fields, this one is most accessible when you travel by car to the Luberon Roussillon area. Its a must stop just to feel and be one with the lavenders or take beautiful photos of the lavender fields with the Abbaye",
          "So yes it's becoming super super famous and actually the day I visited there were shooting, tourist bus and everything. However, be sure not to stop at the lavender (which is great as well though), and enter the place. You feel so tranquil inside and can actually appreciate the",
          "It is well worth the visit. The view is stunning, the smell of Lavender breathtaking. Try to be there in the morning. And try to avoid chinese groups. Amongst hundreds of people respecting the monestary and thecrules they are the ones to ignore barricades or fences and trample",
          "Notre-Dame de Senanque is an iconic landmark in Provence but it's important to keep in mind that it is not a tourist attraction in the normal sense - it is still operating as a Cistercian abbey and monastery as it has done since the 12th Century. The grounds are lovely and it is",
          "End of June with the lavender in full bloom, yes there are bus loads of people, yes, it is on the beaten Provencal tourist's path... But there IS a reason for all this attention: The Abbey in its setting is stunning. One of the great painting locations in Provence, when the",
          "I wanted so badly to visit the Abbey and maybe that is why I wasn't that impressed by it. It is nice, there is lavender and that's all I can say.",
          "We did not visit the interior but came to see the classic scene of lavender fields and the abbey. Since our last visit 15 years ago access to the classic views is more difficult but it is still a nice place when the lavender is in bloom.",
          "When in provance ia must-visit. Reserve a day for the trip, pick a sunny day of the end of June when lavander blooms. The drive between the hills and the waste, purple lavender fields are some outstanding experience. Stop by the fields, feel the smell, take pictures, have a",
          "It looks great on the postcard. Otherwise nothing remarkable. It is quiet and a field of lavande in front of it.",
          "We visited Senanque Abbey 42 years ago when there were very very few tourists. It was July and the lavender was in full bloom. However, we were not at all disappointed with this return visit. The buildings have been wonderfully restored to their original glory. We arrived at",
          "This was by far one of the most amazing things we saw in Provence. The 12th century abbey was peaceful, very well maintained. The tour, although in French, was very informative. The setting was gorgeous. If you are even slightly interested in history, go and see it. It is surely",

          "We drove here, along a hilly, winding road in the countryside. The abbey buildings are simple and unornamented, according to Cistercian custom. The abbey is still functioning today, with monks living on the property. The church is massive and impressive: very simple interior",

          "The Senanque Abbey was a tranquil and stunning stop along our journey through Provence. It was after the lavender harvest, so imagine it would be even more breathtaking while it's in bloom. If they are selling the lavender Financiers in the courtyard while you are there, BUY",

          "As a history buff I was really looking forward to this visit. The views as you descent to the bottom of the valley from neighboring Gordes are simply amazing - especially when it's lavender season. While the abbey's location is picturesque, what you find inside falls far short",
          "A walk to the Abbaye de S\u00e9nanque is the nicest way to get there and you will get a bird's eye view over the abbey. Go early in summer because the walk will be shaded and the abbey grounds are so much nicer with no one around. If you want to see the interior then check out the",

          "I've learned a lot about this Cistercian abbey. The strict way of living etc. The accommodations very rigid etc.",
          "We had fond memories of visiting Senanque years ago and weren't disappointed when we arrived. The situation is stunning and the abbey buildings beautiful. However, if you arrive after 11 am, the only possibility of visiting the interior is to pay 7 euros and wait for the next",
          "you can see rows of Lavender tree which must be beautiful during the peak with this beautiful Abbey. The Abbey is very quite (you wont see the monks) but you are expected to maintain silence.",
          "The abbaye is well worth the drive! We were there in July when the lavender was still blooming and it was stunning. We chose not to go in as it was +40 that day and we were not about to put on long sleeves and pants! We enjoyed taking pictures from outside though.",
          "What can you say about one of the archetypal sights of Provence. The standard picture. With its roots in the 11th century, the abbey has survived invasion, under-manning, revolution and always come back. It is situated deep in a narrow cleft in the rocks of the plateau around",
          "We visited on a crowded weekend afternoon. Even so, this location had an ethereal sense of peace and beauty. Note that there is nothing much to do here except for letting the ambience soak your soul. I would like to come here early on a quiet morning next time. It would be",
          "I expected this attraction to be picturesque, but was amazed by how tranquil and peaceful I found it. You drive down a winding mountain road from Gordes to get to the Abbaye. As you descend you feel the air getting cooler and the atmosphere calmer. The parking lot is well placed",
          "We visited the Abbaye via foot by doing a hike from Gordes. The hike was very pretty, though not very well marked and I think we may have arrived at the Abbaye by sheer luck. The abbaye is nestled in between the hills and has fields of lavendar. During the months when it is",
          "We were in this area around 20-22 June and unfortunately the lavender was not yet in bloom. There were many cars and busses so we decided not to proceed into the abbey.....however it is a beautiful region of France and the view of the Abbey in the background and fields in front",
          "We really enjoyed our trip. We missed he tour but as it was only in French that didn't matter. We didn't spend long so possibly not worth the cost, but beautiful to see and so peaceful.",
          "Very scenic but access is restricted to French language only tours every 30min, which is clraly not ideal.",
          "A lovely spot to visit. We walked there fom Gourdes and enjoyed a lovely picnic in the grounds overlooking the lavender. Such a pretty location coupled with the beautiful abby. This is definitely worth a visit when in the area.",
          "I was informed by reception that the tour was long and only in French and would therefore be uninteresting. I don't know if anything has changed.",
          "we arrived in july and the lavander was still in flower. when we saw it from the road above, didn't think it was so beautiful, but the close view is amazing.",
          "Pretty walk out from Gordes to the Abbey and there was a nice greeting from people in the driveway offering to say prayers. The arrangement for the tours is very much take it or leave it and we decided to have a wander around on our own which still cost 7 Euro each ...the",
          "But do not spend 7 Euros each on being bored in French, the guided tour is too long and even though we understand French it was boring and at children's level. Had expected to learn more about the farming of the Lavender and honey but nothing!",
          "The postcard that brought me here was taken in July, I was there in Sept. I think that the lavender fields are the highlight needed for the best rating. The tour, offered only in French, we skipped. It was nice to see this 800 year old structure in use today as it was designed",
          "This unexpected monastery awaits you after winding your way down a steep and rocky road. It is beautiful inside and out - a very spiritual experience that is well worth the journey.",
          "Weaving your way to this 12th century Cisterian Abbaye is an adventure worth the effort. In spite of many tourists the site is suprisingly tranquil. The complex rests tucked into the surrounding hills seemingly undisturbed by the passage of centuries. From the parking area one",
          "Lavender still there, but not as beautiful as it is in July. The tour of the Abbaye was only available in French so I didn't do it.",
          "I don't, and as other reviewers have said, you can only tour the buildings with a French guide, and it's not cheap. I hoped to get some feeling for the life of the monks, old or new, but we didn't, as there's no sign of them. I understand that the monks choose to live a spartan",
          "definitely worth a detour. the visit lasts less than an hour. beautiful grounds covered with lavender",
          "peaceful location, go early and you've the place to yourself fields of lavender showing for us in late July",
          "Most of the other fields have been harvested but there's still a very large field outside this Abbey. However we didn't take the 1 hour guided tour as it's only in French (and we don't understand French)",
          "We visited this fantastic place early in the morning before a bus load of tourists arrived. The lavender field was as beautiful as 'advertised'. We were there in late July and flowers were just in full bloom. We walked around the main building to enjoy the lavender field first.",
          "but unfortunately it is flooded with masses of tourists, most of which are not interested in the religious history and magic of this sacred place. If you really want to understand and appreciate this unique spot you should do (at least) two things: 1) don't drive to the abbeye,",
          "Loved the scenery, the smell of lavender, the serenity and focus of the Abbey. We didn't expect the Abbey to be our main experience, so the brief stay inside was perfect. The setting beside the fields was a rare chance to feel like you are inside a painting most people only",
          "We went here for the Lavender fields but were disappointed . They were there but given the hype expected a whole lot more . What was there was nice . The Abbaye is worth a visit from the outside but the tour inside is way too long- an hour and a quarter and the expense",
          "I can imagine how amazing this place would be when the lavender is in bloom. This is such a tranquil place in the middle of the Provence countryside! Our tour group hiked through the rock strewn paths down to the Abbaye, which was very special as well. The rock walls paths",
          "This is must see attraction when you are near the Gordes! Beautiful Abbaye with amazing blue fields, everyone wants have a photo in the fields! If you wanna go inside, be careful to dress code, visible shoulders are not tolerated! Just few minutes by car from Gordes! Have a stop",
          "Wish the lavender fields were active. We hiked there from Gordes through fields and mountains....about 3 hours one way. Tiring and near impossible to get a ride back. Not for the faint of heart, but stunning.",
          "Even it\u2019s very touristic and many busses are stopping it\u2019s a definitely worth a visit, you won\u2019t regret a trip to this wonderful place Driving down from the mountain seeing the abbey in the valley with lavender fields in front is a great view. Park the car in front and make a",
          "It's a place where you should not miss. The lavender field and the abbey go along very well, it brings out the harmonious of the place. It was worth while to travel there!",
          "Every so -and so, you need some reflection and meditative time. The Abbey is just that place. It is a functioning Cistercian abbey whose roots date back to 1148...I have difficulty remembering yesterday....but to continue.... The first look is from the outside and you begin",
          "You would expect it to be on top of a hill and surprisingly enough you discover it is at the bottom of a valley. Surrounded by an amazing lavender plantation, your senses are all awake. If you want to get the chance to see the cloister you should book a guided visit and the",
          "We were asked to put Gordes onto our French Holiday plans by a friend in Lyon and we couldnt thank him enough for putting this on our radar. We drove to the Abbey only towards the evening and hence could not enter the abbey as it was closed. However, the real beauty of the place",
          "We drove the 7 minutes from our hotel in Gordes early in the morning as we read to do, but found that we had to wait at least 30 minutes for the sun to rise up from the hill behind us to land on the lavender. Even then, it was still hidden from the lavender on the left side",
          "It is simply postcard perfect to have the summer lavender blooms as the foreground to the historical Abbey de Senanque. The gift shop sells everything lavender and more. I was able to get fragrant and good quality Savon de Marseilles there. My only regret was not spending more",
          "We were out touring the area, so a stop to this abbey was a MUST! We knew the lavender wasn't quite ready, thanks to the reviews on this site! We went to visit before dinner in the evening, so we basically had the place to ourselves. We did not visit the inside, just enjoyed the",
          "On a sunny and hot july day we arrived - amongst hordes of chinese tourists- at the spectacular Abbaye de Senanque to admire the lavender fields surrounding this amazing place. We were lucky as the lavender will be harvested soon and its worthwhile the detour to admire the",
          "We loved visiting the Abbaye de Senanque. My husband and I travelled to Provence because I wanted to see the lavender fields, so the Abbey was top of our list of things to do. You don't have to pay to visit the grounds, you can go and take pictures of the lavender and outside of",
          "We were lucky to visit when the lavender was on bloom and it was breathtaking. Our driver skipped the tour because she was so knowledgable and because our French isn't fantastic. At noon the bells rang for mass and visitors may go to the mass. The monks take a vow of silence",
          "We were hoping to see the lavender flowering, however due to the cold spring experienced in this part of the world the lavender will not be out for at least another week, possibly two. However we were glad we went to see the Abbaye anyway. We didn't go inside as none of the five",
          "Nice visit of an old Abbey surrounded by amazing lavender fields. Gilded tour was a little long and in French only.",
          "Beautifully located historic abbey behind Gordes. We arrived just too early for the lavender to be out so go towards the end of June, into July for the best effect. Tours were conducted in French (by ann ethusiastic guide) so for english speakers was a bit slow, could have been",
          "We chose this destination based on all the beautiful pictures I have seen of the lavender fields. Much to my disappointment the lavender wasn't in bloom when we arrived but as other travelers noted, it's a beautiful location and the drive to get there is very picturesque.",
          "If you are in the area, be sure to make a stop. You can visit outside without any fee, but if you wish to visit inside, there is a small admission fee. The inside visit is worth it: make sure to visit the website before to see at what time they have guided visits! Enjoy :)",
          "I agree with others about the lack of translations at the site. If your road trip brings you to the area, be sure to make a stop.",
          "This is a beautiful abbey in an awesome setting . Best part are the views from outside. We did the inside tour which is very disappointing . Apart from the tour offered only in French, there is not much to see inside, other than a lovely courtyard, and the guide spends way too",
          "Visited in may and the abbey is a beautiful place. My only fault would be unless you speak fluent french there is no point taking the tour as it is only available with a french guide and you have to take it to see inside the abbey which is a real shame as it seems popular with",
          "I've often spent time in Provence and I've been at least half a dozen times at this beautiful monument of peace. Despite the huge amount of visitors, despite the limited time you get to stay it's definitely worth it, to experience this building nestled into a deep valley,",
          "We went in early May. It's a bit of a drive to get to, but the canyon setting and the building are so picturesque. We didn't tour inside, just went walking around, took some pictures and went in the chapel for a few minutes. Very relaxing and peaceful. Not too crowded that",
          "We took a tour, quite interesting on the inside, but particularly appreciated the view outside, with a striking setting against the mountains",
          "Just outside Gordes, itself a worthwhile attraction, the abbey sits quietly in a pastoral valley, surrounded by lavandar fields. The approach from above is lovely, and the whole scene is very evocative of Medieval monastic life. We came late in the day and were unable to get",
          "Set in a beatiful valley north of Gordes, the Abbaye is hemmed in by steep slopes. La Chemin de l'Abbaye from Gordes descends into this valley on a road that is one lane plus but not two lanes til you get to the valley floor. Be prepared to pull over or yield or both. We",
          "You will smell the wonderful scent of lavender flowers growing on the abby property before you get a glimpse of the structure itself. The fields of lavender, grown and tended by the sisters and brothers residing at the abby, are a sight to behold. This monastic community is",
          "It is worth to drive over there. The monastery is beautiful and surrounded by Lavender fields. Great pictures, peaceful place.",
          "Lovely setting, and the drive to the abbey is also delightful. We would like to return when the lavender fields are in full bloom.",
          "Worth the drive there. Isolated and memorable. The description in them Michelin guide is very good. Etc etc etc",
          "It is not well known, but most monasteries, and especially those in the Benedictine tradition, offer hospitality. I stayed at the monastery on a personal retreat in July. The lavender was in bloom, the location is breathtaking, and the possibility of attending the chanting of",
          "We visited the Abbey Senanque in early July of this year when the lavender was in full bloom. The views upward of the surrounding hillsides, the architecture, the history, and of course the sight and fragrance of lavender made this a special moment during our two weeks in",
          "Even though there are always hordes of tourists this is a special place with its own unique atmosphere. Get there early and stroll around. The tour is only in French!",
          "This was one of my must see places on our trip. While we were there in September, not 'lavender season', is was still wonderful to see all the plants, row upon row. I could close my eyes, breath deep and imagine it in full bloom, with the scent of lavender in the air. The drive",
          "The setting of this abbey is just so beautiful. There are lots of spots to take memorable pictures, walk through the lavender fields and smell the plants. It's definitely worth going when the lavender is in bloom in the summer. The drive there is beautiful, great views all",
          "I visited the Abbaye de Senanque in Provence France in late June. I was ill prepared for the weather. Provence is extremely hot and humid. The drive up to the abbaye was extraordinary with views of green hills and blue skies. The most amazing part was, of course, the lavender,",
          "We were recommended a visit to this village. On our approach we were met with the most fantastic sight. We just ambled around this most beautiful village, shopping, eating and drinking. We knew it was a mountain side village but had no idea how beautiful it would be. Very",

        "wiki": "Saint Martial (3rd century), called \"the Apostle of the Gauls\" or \"the Apostle of Aquitaine\", was the first bishop of Limoges. His feast day is June 30.\n\n\n== Life ==\nThere is no accurate information as to the origin, dates of birth and death, or the acts of this bishop. According to Gregory of Tours, during the time of the Emperors Decius  Pope Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatien to Tours, Trophimus to Arles, Paul to Narbonne, Saturnin to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges. He succeeded in converting the inhabitants to Christianity, and his memory has always been venerated there.\n\n\n== Abbey ==\n\nMartial died in Limoges and was buried outside the Roman town. As his tomb became progressively more important as a pilgrimage site, the monks found patronage in the Benedictine order in the 9th century. The site became the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Martial, a great library (second only to the library at Cluny) and scriptorium. The 12th-century chronicler Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois worked in its library.The abbaye de Saint-Martial, one of the great pilgrimage churches of western Christianity, was so thoroughly razed in the 19th century, that only the scattered manuscripts of its library remain. Some of said manuscripts had been bought for Louis XV and have come to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France. The original crypt was exhumed in 1966\u20131970. Twelve Romanesque carved capitals were discovered built into the foundations of a barn and purchased in 1994 for the Museum of the Bishopric of Limoges.\n\n\n== Hagiography ==\n\nThe Miracula Martialis, an account of 7th-, 8th- and 9th-century miracles, was written shortly after 854.\nThe influx of pilgrims to the abbey where the historical Martial lay buried encouraged the creation of an elaborate hagiography during the 10th century. As the hagiography grew, Martial was moved back in time: now, sent into Gaul by Saint Peter himself, he is said to have evangelized not only the Province of Limoges but all of Aquitaine. He performed many miracles, among others the raising of a dead man to life, by touching him with a rod that Saint Peter had given him.The mythology culminated in the 11th century forgeries of Ademar of Chabannes, The Life of St. Martial, attributed to Bishop Aurelian, his successor, which was designed to 'prove' that Martial had been baptized by Peter, was one of the seventy-two disciples and present at the Last Supper.In the 13th century compendium of lore, the Golden Legend, the legendary Martial appears with many miracles, casting out fiends and raising the dead and conducting mass baptisms.In the midst of a revival of his cult in the 14th century, 73 miracles were recorded between 1378 and 1388 in the Miracula sancti Martialis anno 1388 patrata.\nAs late as 1854, Mons. Buissas, Bishop of Limoges, petitioned Pope Pius IX to bestow on Martial the honors of a disciple of Christ, but was turned down. The full discovery of Ademar's tissue of forged documents, including an imaginary church council and a papal letter, was not revealed until the 1920s, and continued for several generations to be resisted in conservative Catholic circles.\nSaint Martial also became associated with Saint Valerie of Limoges, a legendary martyr of the 3rd or 4th centuries, who is said to have carried her head to him after decapitation.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nHis help was invoked during an epidemic of widespread ergot poisoning in Limoges in 994.\nMartial was particularly honored in Bordeaux, where his pastoral staff was kept in the Basilica Saint-Seurin and used in processions to invoke his aid during outbreaks of pestilence.\nHe is also venerated in Italy, where Colle di Val d'Elsa Cathedral is dedicated to him.\nThe Cloisters has a 12th-century stained-glass window of \"Saint Martial Founding the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre\".St. Martial's chapel at the Papal palace in Avignon was used for deliberations during conclaves. Saint-Martial Temple, a gothic church in Avignon was completed in 1402.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Saint Martial at Wikimedia Commons",

          "We were greeted at the door by a lovely lady who gave us a leaflet, in English, about the church. This was something which we were not expecting, a protestant church deep within Catholic France. Compared with Catholic churches, its interior is plain and peaceful with an apsidal",
          "There was no access to the church. The gardens are attractive and would be a good place to enjoy lunch"

Turned out to be a marriage blessing of an English couple, so when they went off, we went in. Simple stone church, no adornments, peaceful and welcoming. And a warm welcome from English speaking volunteers. Just lovely.",

        "wiki": "Medina, officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0629\u200e, romanized: al-Madinat al-Munawwarah, lit. 'The Enlightened City'), commonly simplified as Mad\u012bnah or Madinah, is one of the three holiest cities in Islam and the capital of the Medina Region of Saudi Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782, making it the fourth-most populous city in the country. Located at the core of the Madinah Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293 km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys, agricultural spaces, older dormant volcanoes and the Nafud desert.\nThe city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in Islamic tradition, the other two being Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory. The original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib and it is referred to by the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab (The Confederates). It was renamed Mad\u012bnat an-Nab\u012b (City of the Prophet or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (The Enlightened City), before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in English as Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah al-Munawwarah interchangeably.The city is known to have existed for over 1500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca, otherwise known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), composed of the citizens of Madinah, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun, collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.Much like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short existence. The region is known to have been controlled by Arabian Jewish tribes (up to the 5th century CE), the 'Aws and Khazraj (up to Muhammad's arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622\u2013660 CE), Umayyads (660\u2013749 CE), Abbasids (749\u20131254 CE), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254\u20131517 CE), the Ottomans (1517\u20131805 CE), the First Saudi State (1805\u20131811 CE), Muhammad Ali Pasha (1811\u20131840 CE), the Ottomans for a second time (1840\u20131918), the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca (1918\u20131925 CE) and finally is in the hands of the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1925\u2013present CE).In addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi' cemetery and the Seven Mosques among others. Recently, after the Saudi conquest, the Saudis carried out a demolition of several tombs and domes in and around the region fearing these might become sites of association of others in worship beside Allah (shirk).\n\n\n== History ==\nMedina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n\n==== Yathrib ====\nBefore the advent of Islam, the city was known as Yathrib (pronounced [\u02c8ja\u03b8r\u026ab]; \u064a\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0628). The word Yathrib has been recorded in \u0100yah (verse) 13 of Surah (chapter) 33 of the Qur'an.[Quran 33:13] and is thus known to have been the name of the city up to the Battle of the Trench. Muhammad later forbade calling the city by this name.\n\n\n==== Taybah and Tabah ====\nSometime after the battle, the Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah (the Kind or the Good) ([\u02c8t\u02e4ajba]; \u0637\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629) and Tabah (Arabic: \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0629\u200e) which is of similar meaning. This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, \"Ya Taybah!\" (O Taybah!). The two names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the Kind).\n\n\n==== Madinah ====\nThe city has also been called Madinah in some ahadith. The names al-Mad\u012bnah an-Nabawiyyah (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629) and Mad\u012bnat un-Nab\u012b (both meaning \"City of the Prophet\" or \"The Prophet's City\") and al-Mad\u012bnat ul-Munawwarah (\"The Enlightened City\") are all derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in official documents and road signage, along with Madinah.\n\n\n=== Early history and Jewish control ===\nMedina is known to have been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BC. By the fourth century CE, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish tribes that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Qurayza, and Banu Nadir. Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian Empire's domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the Persian Shah.The situation changed after the arrival of two new Arab tribes, the 'Aws or Banu 'Aws and the Khazraj, also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but later revolted and became independent.\n\n\n=== Under the 'Aws and Khazraj ===\nToward the end of the 5th century, the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the 'Aws and the Khazraj. However, according to Scottish scholar, William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.Early Muslim chronicler Ibn Ishaq tells of an ancient conflict between the last Yemenite king of the Himyarite Kingdom and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognised the Ka'bah as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.Eventually the Banu 'Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's Hijrah (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the 'Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj. They fought a total of four wars.Their last and bloodiest known battle was the Battle of Bu'ath, fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. He was the most respected inhabitant of the city prior to Muhammad's arrival. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of Yathrib met secretly with Muhammad in 'Aqaba, a place outside Mecca, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to the city, where Muhammad could serve a mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n\n=== Under Muhammad and the Rashidun ===\n\nIn 622 CE (1 AH), Muhammad and an estimated 70 Meccan Muhajirun left Mecca over a period of a few months for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced the new religion of Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as the leader of the city. The natives of Yathrib who had converted to Islam of any background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called the Ansar (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the Zakat tax.\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, all parties in the area agreed to the Constitution of Medina, which committed all parties to mutual cooperation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess. In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as Kit\u0101b Dimmat al-Nabi, written in the 17th year of the Hijra (638 CE), and which gave express liberty to Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks. In return, they were to pay the jizya annually for protection by their patrons.\n\n\n==== Battle of Uhud ====\n\nIn the year 625 CE (3 AH), Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a senior chieftain of Mecca who later converted to Islam, led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the Qurayshi army with an estimated 1,000 troops, but just as the army approached the battlefield, 300 men under 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew, dealing a severe blow to the Muslim army's morale. Muhammad continued marching with his now 700-strong force and ordered a group of 50 archers to climb a small hill, now called Jabal ar-Rummaah (The Archers' Hill) to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry and to provide protection to the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to retreat. The frontline was pushed further and further away from the archers and foreseeing the battle to have be a victory for the Muslims, the archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading the rest to not disobey their Muhammad's orders.\nSeeing that the archers were starting to descend from the hill, Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded his unit to ambush the hill and his cavalry unit pursued the descending archers were systematically slain by being caught in the plain ahead of the hill and the frontline, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill who were shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but with little to no effect. However, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Madanis (people of Medina) suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.\n\n\n==== Battle of the Trench ====\n\nIn 627 CE (5 AH), Abu Sufyan led another force toward Medina. Knowing of his intentions, Muhammad asked for proposals for defending the northern flank of the city, as the east and west were protected by volcanic rocks and the south was covered with palm trees. Salman al-Farsi, a Persian Sahabi who was familiar with Sasanian war tactics recommended digging a trench to protect the city and the Prophet accepted it. The subsequent siege came to be became known as the Battle of the Trench and the Battle of the Confederates. After a month-long siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again due to the harsh winter.\nDuring the siege, Abu Sufyan contacted the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the Muslim defenders and effectively encircle the defenders. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Aws negotiated on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to appoint one of their chiefs who had converted to Islam, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason in the Book of Deutoronomy. This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The French historian Robert Mantran proposes that from this point of view it was successful\u2014from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.In the ten years following the hijra, Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he marched on Mecca, entering it without battle in 630 CE or 8 AH. Despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca, the growing importance of Mecca in Islam, the significance of the Ka'bah as the center of the Islamic world, as the direction of prayer (Qibla), and in the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the base of operations of the early Rashidun Caliphate.The city is presumed to have been renamed Madinat al-Nabi (\"City of the Prophet\" in Arabic) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and the city being the site of his burial. Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the Aramaic word Medinta, which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.\nUnder the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the reign of 'Uthman ibn al-Affan, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at some of his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE and assassinated him in his own home. Ali, the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in Iraq for being in a more strategic location. Since then, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power. Medina witnessed little to no economic growth during and after Ali's reign.\n\n\n=== Under subsequent Islamic regimes ===\n\n\n==== Umayyad Caliphate ====\nAfter al-Hasan, the son of 'Ali, ceded power to Mu'awiyah I, son of Abu Sufyan, Mu'awiyah marched into Kufa, Ali's capital, and received the allegiance of the local 'Iraqis. This is considered to be the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. Mu'awiyah's governors took special care of Medina and dug the 'Ayn az-Zarqa'a (\"Blue Spring\") spring along with a project that included the creation of underground ducts for the purposes of irrigation. Dams were built in some of the wadis and the subsequent agricultural boom led to the strengthening of the economy.\n\nFollowing a period of unrest during the Second Fitna in 679 CE (60 AH), Husayn ibn 'Ali was martyred at Karbala and Yazid assumed unchecked control for the next three years. In 682 CE (63 AH), Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself Caliph of Mecca and the people of Medina swore allegiance to him. This led to an eight-year-long period of economic distress for the city. In 692 CE (73 AH), the Umayyads regained power and Medina experienced its second period of huge economic growth. Trade improved and more people moved into the city. The banks of Wadi al-'Aqiq were now lush with greenery. This period of peace and prosperity coincided with the rule of 'Umar ibn Abdulaziz, who many consider to be the fifth of the Rashidun.\n\n\n==== Abbasid Caliphate ====\nAbdulbasit A. Badr, in his book, Madinah, The Enlightened City: History and Landmarks, divides this period into three distinct phases:\n\nBadr describes the period between 749\u2013974 CE (132\u2013363 AH) as a push-and-pull between peace and political turmoil, while Medina continued to pay allegiance to the Abbasids. From 974\u20131151 CE (363\u2013546 AH), Medina was in a liaison with the Fatimids, even though the political stand between the two remained turbulent and did not exceed the normal allegiance. From 1151 CE (546 AH) onwards, Medina paid allegiance to the Zengids, and the Emir Nuruddin Zangi took care of the roads used by pilgrims and funded the fixing of the water sources and streets. When he visited Medina in 1162 CE (557 AH), he ordered the construction of a new wall that encompassed the new urban areas outside the old city wall. Zangi was succeeded by Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, who supported Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Governor of Medina, and greatly funded the growth of the city while slashing taxes paid by the pilgrims. He also funded the Bedouins who lived on the routes used by pilgrims to protect them on their journeys. The later Abbasids also continued to fund the expenses of the city. While Medina was formally allied with the Abbasids during this period, they maintained closer relations with the Zengids and Ayyubids. The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2 m) high, dating from this period, and was flanked with towers. Of its four gates, the Bab al-Salam (\"The Gate of Peace\"), was remarked for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, the west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations.\n\n\n==== Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo ====\nAfter a brutal long conflict with the Abbasids, the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo took over the Egyptian governorate and effectively gained control of Medina. In 1256 CE (Rajab 654 AH), Medina was threatened by lava from the Harrat Rahat volcanic region but was narrowly saved from being burnt after the lava turned northward. During Mamluk reign, the Masjid an-Nabawi caught fire twice. Once in 1256 CE (654 AH), when the storage caught fire, burning the entire mosque, and the other time in 1481 CE (886 AH), when the masjid was struck by lightning. This period also coincided with an increase in scholarly activity in Medina, with scholars such as Ibn Farhun, Al-Hafiz Zain al-Din al-'Iraqi, Al Sakhawi and others settling in the city. The striking iconic Green Dome also found its beginnings as a cupola built under Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun as-Salihi in 1297 CE (678 AH).\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\n\n==== First Ottoman period ====\nIn 1517 CE (923 AH), the first Ottoman period began with Selim I's conquest of Mamluk Egypt. This added Medina to their territory and they continued the tradition of showering Medina with money and aid. In 1532 CE (939 AH), Suleiman the Magnificent built a secure fortress around the city and constructed a strong castle armed by an Ottoman battalion to protect the city. This is also the period in which many of the Prophet's Mosque's modern features were built even though it wasn't painted green yet. These suburbs also had walls and gates. The Ottoman sultans took a keen interest in the Prophet's Mosque and redesigned it over and over to suit their preferences.\n\n\n==== First Saudi insurgency ====\nAs the Ottomans' hold over their domains broke loose, the Madanis pledged alliance to Saud bin Abdulaziz, founder of the First Saudi state in 1805 CE (1220 AH), who quickly took over the city. In 1811 CE (1226 AH), Muhammad Ali Pasha, Ottoman commander and Wali of Egypt, commanded two armies under each of his two sons to seize Medina, the first one, under the elder Towson Pasha, failed to take Medina. But the second one, a larger army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, succeeded after battling a fierce resistance movement.\n\n\n==== Muhammad Ali Pasha's era ====\nAfter defeating his Saudi foes, Muhammad Ali Pasha took over governance of Medina and although he did not formally declare independence, his governance took on more of a semi-autonomous style. Muhammad's sons, Towson and Ibrahim, alternated in the governance of the city. Ibrahim renovated the city's walls and the Prophet's Mosque. He established a grand provision distribution center (taqiyya) to distribute food and alms to the needy and Medina lived a period of security and peace, In 1840 CE (1256 AH), Muhammad moved his troops out of the city and officially handed the city to the central Ottoman command.\n\n\n==== Second Ottoman period ====\n\nFour years in 1844 CE (1260 AH), after Muhammad Ali Pasha's departure, Davud Pasha was given the position of governor of Egypt under the Ottoman sultan. Davud was responsible for renovating the Prophet's mosque on Sultan Abdulmejid I's orders. When Abdul Hamid II assumed power, he made Medina stand out of the desert with a number of modern marvels, including a radio communication station, an power plant for the Prophet's Mosque and its immediate vicinity, a telegraph line between Medina and Istanbul, and the Hejaz railway which ran from Damascus to Medina with a planned extension to Mecca. Within one decade, the population of the city multiplied by leaps and bounds and reached 80,000. Around this time, Medina started falling prey to a new threat, the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca in the south. Medina witnessed the longest siege in its history during and after World War I.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Sharifate of Mecca and Saudi conquest ====\nThe Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, first attacked Medina on 6 June 1916 CE or 4 Sha'aban 1334 AH, in the middle of World War I. Four days later, Husayn held Medina in a bitter 3-year siege, during which the people faced food shortages, widespread disease and mass emigration. Fakhri Pasha, governor of Medina, tenaciously held on during the Siege of Medina from 10 June 1916 and refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the Armistice of Moudros, until he was arrested by his own men and the city was taken over by the Sharifate on 10 January 1919. Husayn largely won the war due to his alliance with the British. In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly dispatched the Sacred Relics of Muhammad to the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. As of 1920, the British described Medina as \"much more self-supporting than Mecca.\" After the Great War, the Sharif of Mecca, Sayyid Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, the people of Medina secretly entered an agreement with Ibn Saud in 1924, and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz conquered Medina as part of the Saudi conquest of Hejaz on 5 December 1925 (19 Jumada I 1344 AH) which gave way to the whole of the Hejaz being incorporated into the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n==== Under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ====\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focused more on the expansion of the city and the demolition of former sites that violated Islamic principles and Islamic law such as the tombs at al-Baqi. Nowadays, the city mostly only holds religious significance and as such, just like Mecca, has given rise to a number of hotels surrounding the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, which unlike the Masjid Al-\u1e24ar\u0101m, is equipped with an underground parking. The old city's walls have been destroyed and replaced with the three ring roads that encircle Medina today, named in order of length, King Faisal Road, King Abdullah Road and King Khalid Road. Medina's ring roads generally see less traffic overall compared to the four ring roads of Mecca.\n\nAn international airport, named the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport, now serves the city and is located on Highway 340, known locally as the Old Qassim Road. The city now sits at the crossroads of two major Saudi Arabian highways, Highway 60, known as the Qassim\u2013Medina Highway, and Highway 15 which connects the city to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk in the north and onward, known as the Al Hijrah Highway or Al Hijrah Road, after Muhammad's journey. The old Ottoman railway system was shutdown after their departure from the region and the old railway station has now been converted into a museum. The city has recently seen another connection and mode of transport between it and Mecca, the Haramain high-speed railway line connects the two cities via King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh, King Abdulaziz International Airport and the city of Jeddah in under 3 hours.\nThough the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, the Haram area of Medina itself is much smaller than that of Mecca and Medina has recently seen an increase in the number of Muslim and Non-Muslim expatriate workers of other nationalities, most commonly South Asian peoples and people from other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded al-Masjid an-Nabawi.\n\n\n==== Destruction of heritage ====\n\nSaudi Arabia is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to shirk (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old. Critics have described this as \"Saudi vandalism\" and claim that 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost in Medina and Mecca over the last 50 years. The most famous example of this is the demolition of al-Baqi.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMedina is located in the Hejaz region which is a 200 km (124 mi) wide strip between the Nafud desert and the Red Sea. Located approximately 720 km (447 mi) northwest of Riyadh which is at the center of the Saudi desert, the city is 250 km (155 mi) away from the west coast of Saudi Arabia and at an elevation of approximately 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. It lies at 39\u00ba36' longitude east and 24\u00ba28' latitude north. It covers an area of about 589 square kilometres (227 square miles). The city has been divided into twelve (12) districts, 7 of which have been categorised as urban districts, while the other 5 have been categorised as suburban.\n\n\n=== Elevation ===\nLike most cities in the Hejaz region, Medina is situated at a very high elevation. Almost three times as high as Mecca, the city is situated at 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Mount Uhud is the highest peak in Medina and is 1,077 meters (3,533 feet) tall.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains and volcanic hills. The soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly basalt, while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era.  It is surrounded by a number of famous mountains, most notably Jabal Al-Hujjaj (The Pilgrims' Mountain) to the west, Sal'aa Mountain to the north-west, Jabal al-'Ir or Caravan Mountain to the south and Mount Uhud to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the tripoint of the three valleys (wadis) of Wadi al 'Aql, Wadi al 'Aqiq, and Wadi al Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry deserted mountainous region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Medina falls in a hot desert climate region (BWh). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about 43 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) with nights about 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F). Temperatures above 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May. In summer, the wind is north-western, while in the spring and winters, is south-western.\n\n\n== Significance in Islam ==\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of two mosques, Masjid Quba'a and al-Masjid an-Nabawi. Both of these mosques were built by Muhammad himself. Islamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times in the Quran, two examples are Surah At-Tawbah. verse 101 and Al-Hashr. verse 8. Medinan suras are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts and they are also larger in number. Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in Sahih Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik said the Prophet said: \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people.\"\n\n\n=== The Prophet's Mosque (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) ===\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a prayer in The Prophet's Mosque equates to 1,000 prayers in any other mosque except the Masjid al-Haram where one prayer equates to 100,000 prayers in any other mosque. The mosque was initially just an open space for prayer with a raised and covered minbar (pulpit) built within seven months and was located beside the Prophet's rawdhah (residence, although the word literally means garden) to its side along with the houses of his wives. The mosque was expanded several times throughout history, with many of its internal features developed overtime to suit contemporary standards.\n\nThe modern Prophet's Mosque is famed for the Green Dome situated directly above the Prophet's rawdhah, which currently serves as the burial site for Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab and is used in road signage along with its signature minaret as an icon for Medina itself. The entire piazza of the mosque is shaded from the sun by 250 membrane umbrellas. \n\n\n=== Quba'a Mosque ===\n\nIt is Sunnah to perform prayer at the Quba'a Mosque. According to a hadith, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad said, \"Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\"\nand in another narration,\"Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque \u2013 meaning the Mosque of Quba\u2019 \u2013 and prays there, that will be equivalent to \u2018Umrah.\"It has been recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim that Muhammad used to go to Quba'a every Saturday to offer two rak'ahs of Sunnah prayer. The mosque at Quba'a was built by Muhammad himself upon his arrival to the old city of Medina. Quba'a and the mosque has been referred in the Qur'an indirectly in Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108.\n\n\n=== Other sites ===\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Qiblatayn ====\n\nMasjid al-Qiblatayn is another mosque historically important to Muslims. Muslims believe that Muhammad was commanded to change his direction of prayer (qibla) from praying toward Jerusalem to praying toward the Ka'bah at Mecca, as he was commanded in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 143 and 144. The mosque is currently being expanded to be able to hold more than 4,000 worshippers.\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Fath and the Seven Mosques ====\n\nThree of these historic six mosques were combined recently into the larger Masjid al-Fath with an open courtyard. Sunni sources claim that there is no hadith or any other evidence to prove that Muhammad may have said something about the virtue of these mosques.\n\n\n==== Al-Baqi' Cemetery ====\n\nAl-Baqi' is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of Muhammad, caliphs and scholars are known to have been buried.\n\n\n=== In Islamic eschatology ===\n\n\n==== End of civilization ====\nConcerning the end of civilization in Medina, Abu Hurairah is recorded to have said that Muhammad said:\"The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada'h, they will fall down on their faces dead.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 98)Sufyan ibn Abu Zuhair said Muhammad said:\"Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 99)\n\n\n==== Protection from plague and ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah) ====\n\nWith regards to Medina's protection from plague and ad-Dajjal, the following ahadith were recorded:\n\nby Abu Bakra:\"The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 103)by Abu Hurairah:\"There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 104)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2018, the recorded population was 2,188,138, with a growth rate of 2.32%. Being a destination of Muslims from around the world, Medina witnesses illegal immigration after performing Hajj or Umrah, despite the strict rules the government has enforced. However, the Central Hajj Commissioner Prince Khalid bin Faisal stated that the numbers of illegal staying visitors dropped by 29% in 2018.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion followed by the majority of the population of Medina.\nSunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali) constitute the majority, while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the Nakhawila. Outside the haram, there are significant numbers of Non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSimilar to that of Mecca, Medina exhibits a cross-cultural environment, a city where people of many nationalities and cultures live together and interact with each other on a daily basis. This only helps the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. Established in 1985, the biggest publisher of Quran in the world, it employs around 1100 people and publishes 361 different publications in many languages. It is reported that more than 400,000 people from around the world visit the complex every year. Every visitor is gifted a free copy of the Qur'an at the end of a tour of the facility.\n\n\n=== Museums and arts ===\nThe Al Madinah Museum has several exhibits concerning the cultural and historical heritage of the city featuring different archaeological collections, visual galleries and rare images of the old city. It is also includes the Hejaz Railway Museum. The Dar Al Madinah Museum opened in 2011 and it uncovers the history of Medina specializing in the architectural and urban heritage of the city. There is no archaeology or architecture from the time of Mohammed, except what remains of a few stone defensive towers The Holy Qur'an Exhibition houses rare manuscripts of the Quran, along with other exhibitions that encircle the Masjid an-Nabawi. \nThe Madinah Arts Center, founded in 2018 and operated by the MMDA's Cultural Wing, focuses on modern and contemporary arts. The center aims to enhance arts and enrich the artistic and cultural movement of society, empowering artists of all groups and ages. As of February 2020, before the implementation of social distancing measures and curfews, it held more than 13 group and solo art galleries, along with weekly workshops and discussions. The center is located in King Fahd Park, close to Quba Mosque on an area of 8,200 square meters (88,264 square feet)In 2018, the MMDA launched Madinah Forum of Arabic Calligraphy, an annual forum to celebrate Arabic calligraphy and renowned Arabic calligraphers. The event includes discussions about Arabic Calligraphy, and a gallery to show the work of 50 Arabic calligraphers from 10 countries. The Dar al-Qalam Center for Arabic Calligraphy is located to the northwest of the Masjid an-Nabawi, just across the Hejaz Railway Museum. In April 2020, it was announced that the center was renamed the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Center for Arabic Calligraphy, and upgraded to an international hub for Arabic Calligraphers, in conjunction with the \"Year of Arabic Calligraphy\" event organized by the Ministry of Culture during the years 2020 and 2021.Other projects launched by the MMDA Cultural Wing include the Madinah Forum of Live Sculpture held at Quba Square, with 16 sculptors from 11 countries. The forum aimed to celebrate sculpture as it is an ancient art, and to attract young artists to this form of art.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSaudi Arabia is renowned for its passion of football around the world. Medina hosts two football clubs, Al Ansar FC, and Ohod FC, with their shared home venue at Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Stadium.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHistorically, Medina's economy was dependent on the sale of dates and other agricultural activities. As of 1920, 139 varieties of dates were being grown in the area, along with other vegetables. Religious tourism plays a major part in Medina's economy, being the second holiest city in Islam, and holding many historical Islamic locations, it attracts more than 7 million annual visitors who come to perform Hajj during the Hajj season, and Umrah throughout the year.Medina has two industrial areas, the larger one was established in 2003 with a total area of 10,000,000 m2, and managed by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON). It is located 50 km from Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport, and 200 km from Yanbu Commercial Port, and has 236 factories, which produce petroleum products, building materials, food products, and many other products. The Knowledge Economic City (KEC) is a Saudi Arabian joint stock company founded in 2010. It focuses on real estate development and knowledge-based industries. The project is under development and is expected to highly increase the number of jobs in Medina by its completion.\n\n\n== Human resources ==\n\n\n=== Education and scholarly activity ===\n\n\n==== Primary and secondary education ====\nThe Ministry of Education is the governing body of education in the al-Madinah Province and it operates 724 and 773 public schools for boys and girls respectively throughout the province. Taibah High School is one of the most notable schools in Saudi Arabia. Established in 1942, it was the second-largest school in the country at that time. Many Saudi ministers and government officials have graduated from this high school, which gives it a reputation of excellence and historical importance.\n\n\n==== Higher education and research ====\nTaibah University is a public university providing higher education for the residents of the province, it has 28 colleges, of which 16 are in Medina. It offers 89 academic programs and has a strength of 69210 students as of 2020. The Islamic University, established in 1961, is the oldest higher education institution in the region, with around 22000 students enrolled. It offers majors in Sharia, Qur'an, Usul ad-Din, Hadith, and the Arabic language. The university offers Bachelor of Arts degrees and also Master's and Doctorate degrees. The admission is open to Muslims based on scholarships programs that provide accommodation and living expenses. In 2012, the university expanded its programs by establishing the College of Science, which offers Engineering and Computer science majors. Al Madinah College of Technology, which is governed by TVTC, offers a variety of degree programs including Electrical engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer Sciences and Electronic Sciences. Private universities at Medina include University of Prince Muqrin, the Arab Open University, and Al Rayyan Colleges.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nMedina is served by the Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz International Airport located off Highway 340. It handles domestic flights, while it has scheduled international services to regional destinations in the Middle East. It is the fourth-busiest airport in Saudi Arabia, handling 8,144,790 passengers in 2018. The airport project was announced as the world's best by Engineering News-Record's 3rd Annual Global Best Projects Competition held on September 10, 2015. The airport also received the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certificate in the MENA region. The airport receives higher numbers of passengers during the Hajj.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nIn 2015, the MMDA announced Darb as-Sunnah (Sunnah Path) Project, which aims to develop and transform the 3 km (2 mi) Quba'a Road connecting the Quba'a Mosque to the al-Masjid an-Nabawi to an avenue, paving the whole road for pedestrians and providing service facilities to the visitors. The project also aims to revive the Sunnah where Muhammed used to walk from his house (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) to Quba'a every Saturday afternoon.The city of Medina lies at the junction of two of the most important Saudi highways, Highway 60 and Highway 15. Highway 15 connects Medina to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk and Jordan in the north. Highway 60 connects the city with Yanbu, a port city on the Red Sea in the west and Al Qassim in the east. The city is served by three ring roads: King Faisal Road, a 5 km ring road that surrounds Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, King Abdullah Road, a 27 km road that surrounds most of urban Medina and King Khalid Road is the biggest ring road that surrounds the whole city and some rural areas with 60 km of roads.\n\n\n=== Bus and rapid transit ===\n\nThe bus transport system in Medina was established in 2012 by the MMDA and is operated by SAPTCO. The newly established bus system includes 10 lines connecting different regions of the city to Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, and serves around 20,000 passengers on a daily basis. In 2017, the MMDA launched the Madinah Sightseeing Bus service.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Al-Masjid an-Nabaw\u012b (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u064a\u200e, romanized: al-Masjid an-Nabawi, lit. 'The Prophetic Mosque'), known in English as The Prophet's Mosque, and also known as Al Haram, Al Haram Al Madani and Al Haram Al Nabawi by locals, is a mosque built by the last Islamic prophet Muhammad in the city of Medina in the Al Madinah Province of Saudi Arabia. It was the second mosque built by Muhammad in Madinah, after Masjid Quba'a, and is now one of the largest mosques in the world. It is the second-holiest site in Islam, after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. It is always open, regardless of date or time, and was only closed to visitors in modern times, once, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe land of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi belonged to two young orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, and when they came to know that Muhammad wished to acquire their land for the purposes of erecting a mosque, they went to the Prophet and offered the land to him as a gift; the Prophet insisted on paying a price for the land because they were orphaned children. The price agreed upon was paid by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, who thus became the endower or donor (Arabic: \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0650\u0641\u200e, romanized: waqif) of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi on behalf of, or in favor of, Muhammad. al-Ansari also accommodated Muhammad upon his arrival at Madinah in 622.\nMuhammad shared in the construction of the mosque. Originally an open-air building, the mosque served as a community center, a court of law, and a religious school. There was a raised platform or pulpit (minbar) for the people who taught the Quran and for Muhammad to give the Friday sermon (khutbah). Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated the mosque, naming its walls, doors and minarets after themselves and their forefathers. \nAfter an expansion during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I, it now incorporates the final resting place of Muhammad and the first two Rashidun caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar. One of the most notable features of the site is the Green Dome in the south-east corner of the mosque, originally Aisha's house, where the tomb of Muhammad is located. Many pilgrims who perform the Hajj also go to Madinah to visit (Ziyarah) the Green Dome.  In 1909, under the reign of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II, it became the first place in the Arabian Peninsula to be provided with electrical lights. The mosque is under the control of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The mosque is located at the heart of Madinah and is a major pilgrimage site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Under Muhammad and the Rashidun (622-660 CE or 1-40 AH) ===\n\n\n==== Construction (622 CE or 1 AH) ====\nThe mosque was built by Muhammad in 622 CE (1 AH) after his arrival in Medina. Riding a camel called Qaswa, he arrived at the place where this mosque was built, which was being used as a burial ground. Refusing to accept the land as a gift from the two orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, who owned the land, he bought the land which was paid for by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and it took seven months to complete the construction of the mosque. It measured 30.5 m \u00d7 35.62 m (100.1 ft \u00d7 116.9 ft). The roof which was supported by palm trunks was made of beaten clay and palm leaves. It was at a height of 3.60 m (11.8 ft). The three doors of the mosque were the \"Gate of Mercy\" (\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 Bab ar-Rahmah) to the south, \"Gate of Gabriel\" (\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u062c\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0644 Bab Jibril) to the west and \"Gate of Women\" (\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621) to the east.\n\n\n==== First Expansion (628 CE or 7 AH) ====\nAfter the Battle of Khaybar, the mosque was expanded to 47.32 m (155.2 ft) on each side and three rows of columns were built beside the west wall, which became the place of praying. The mosque remained unaltered during the reign of the first Rashidun caliph Abu Bakr.\n\n\n==== Second Expansion by Umar ====\nThe second caliph Umar demolished all the houses around the mosque except those of Muhammad's wives to expand it. The new mosque's dimensions became 57.49 m \u00d7 66.14 m (188.6 ft \u00d7 217.0 ft). Sun-dried mud bricks were used to construct the walls of the enclosure. Besides strewing pebbles on the floor, the roof's height was increased to 5.6 m (18 ft). Umar constructed three more gates for entrance. He also added the \"Al Butayha\" (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0637\u064a\u062d\u0629) for people to recite poetry.\n\n\n==== Third Expansion by Uthman (649 CE or 30 AH) ====\nThe third caliph Uthman demolished the mosque in 649. Ten months were spent in building the new rectangular shaped mosque whose face was turned towards the Kaaba in Mecca. The new mosque measured 81.40 m \u00d7 62.58 m (267.1 ft \u00d7 205.3 ft). The number of gates as well as their names remained the same. The enclosure was made of stones laid in mortar. The palm trunk columns were replaced by stone columns which were joined by iron clamps. Teakwood was used in reconstructing the ceiling filza.\n\n\n=== Under subsequent Islamic regimes (660-1517 CE or 40-923 AH) ===\n\nIn 707, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705\u2013715) renovated the mosque. It took three years for the work to be completed. Raw materials were procured from the Byzantine Empire. The area of the mosque was increased from the 5,094 square metres (54,830 sq ft) of Uthman's time to 8,672 square metres (93,340 sq ft). A wall was built to segregate the mosque and the houses of the wives of the Prophet. The mosque was reconstructed in a trapezoid shape with the length of the longer side being 101.76 metres (333.9 ft). For the first time, porticoes were built in the mosque connecting the northern part of the structure to the sanctuary. Minarets were also built for the first time as al-Walid constructed four minarets around it.The Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775\u2013785) extended the mosque to the north by 50 metres (160 ft). His name was also inscribed on the walls of the mosque. He also planned to remove six steps to the minbar, but abandoned this idea, fearing damage to the wooden platforms on which they were built. According to an inscription of Ibn Qutaybah, the caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813\u2013833) did \"unspecified work\" on the mosque. Al-Mutawakkil (r. 847\u2013861) lined the enclosure of Prophet's tomb with marble. In 1269, the Mamluk Sultan Baibars sent dozens of artisans led by the eunuch emir Jamal al-Din Muhsin al-Salihi to rebuild the sanctuary, including enclosures around the tombs of the Prophet and of Fatima. The Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri (r. 1501\u20131516) built a dome of stone over his grave in 1476.\n\n\n=== First Ottoman period (1517-1805 & 1840-1919 CE or 923-1220 & 1256-1337 AH) ===\n\nSuleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520-1566) rebuilt the east and west walls of the mosque, and added the northeastern minaret known as S\u00fcleymaniyye. He added a new altar called Ahnaf next to the Prophet's altar, Shafi'iyya, and placed a new steel-covered dome on the tomb of the Prophet. Suleiman the Magnificent wrote the names of the Ottoman sultans from Osman Bey to himself (Kanuni) and revived the \"Gate of Mercy\" (Bab\u00fcrrahme) or the west gate. The pulpit that is used today was built under Murad III (r. 1574-1595). \n\n\n==== First Saudi insurgency (1805-1811 CE or 1220-1226 AH) ====\n\nWhen Saud bin Abdul-Aziz took Medina in 1805, his followers, the Wahhabis, demolished nearly every tomb and dome in Medina in order to prevent their veneration, and the Green Dome is said to have narrowly escaped the same fate. They considered the veneration of tombs and places thought to possess supernatural powers as an offence against tawhid and an act of shirk. The Prophet Muhammad's tomb was stripped of its gold and jewel ornaments, but the dome was preserved either because of an unsuccessful attempt to demolish its hardened structure, or because some time ago Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, wrote that he did not wish to see the dome destroyed despite his aversion to people praying at the tomb.\n\n\n=== Second Ottoman period (1840-1919 CE or 1256-1337 AH) ===\nIn 1817. Mahmud II (r. 1808-1839) completed the construction of the \"Purified Residence\" (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u062d\u0631\u0629 al-Rawdah al-Mutaharah in Arabic and Ravza-i Mutahhara in Turkish) on the southeast side of the mosque and covered with a new dome. The dome was painted green in 1837 and has been known as the \"Green Dome\" (Kubbe-i Hadra) ever since. Mahmud II's successor, Abdulmecid I (r. 1839\u20131861), took thirteen years to rebuild the mosque, beginning in 1849. Red stone bricks were used as the main material in reconstruction of the mosque. The floor area of the mosque was increased by 1,293 square metres (13,920 sq ft). \nThe entire mosque was reorganized except for the tomb of the Prophet, the three altars, the pulpit and the Suleymaniye minaret. On the walls, verses from the Quran were inscribed in Islamic calligraphy. On the northern side of the mosque, a madrasah was built for teaching the Qur'an.  An ablution site was added to the north side. The prayer place on the south side was doubled in width, and covered with small domes. The interiors of the domes are decorated with verses from the Qur'an and couplets from the poem \"Kaside-i B\u00fcrde\". The Kible wall was covered with polished tiles with lines from the Qur'an inscribed. The places of prayer and courtyard were paved with marble and red stone. The fifth minaret, Mecidiyye, was built to the west of the surrounded area.\nAfter the \"Desert Tiger\" Fakhri Pasha's arrest at the end of the Siege of Medina on January 10, 1919, 400 years of Ottoman rule in the region came to an end.\n\n\n=== Saudi rule and modern history (1925-present CE or 1344-present AH) ===\nThe Saudi takeover was characterized by events similar to those that took place in 1805 when the Prince Mohammed ibn Abdulaziz retook the city on 5 December 1925. After the foundation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951 King Abdulaziz (1932\u20131953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new wings to the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced with concrete and braced with copper rings at the top. The Suleymaniyya and Mecidiyye minarets were replaced with two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along the western wall to house historic Qurans and other religious texts.In 1974, King Faisal added 40,440 square metres (435,000 square feet) to the mosque. The area of the mosque was also expanded during the reign of King Fahd in 1985. Bulldozers were used to demolish buildings around the mosque. In 1992, when it was completed, the mosque took over 160,000 square meters (1.7 million square feet) of space. Escalators and 27 courtyards were among the additions to the mosque. A $6 billion project to increase the area of the mosque was announced in September 2012. After completion, the mosque should accommodate between 1.6 million to 2 million worshippers. In March of the following year, Saudi Gazette reported that demolition work had been mostly complete, including the demolition of ten hotels on the eastern side, in addition to houses and other utilities.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe modern-day Masjid an-Nabawi is situated on a rectangular plot and is two stories tall. The Ottoman prayer hall lies towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced into the base of each dome illuminate the interior when the domes are closed. The sliding roof is closed during the afternoon prayer (Dhuhr) to protect the visitors. When the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, they create light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, the courtyard of the Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. The sliding domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies were designed by the German Muslim architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch, his firm SL Rasch GmbH, and Buro Happold.\n\n\n=== Rawdah ash-Sharifah (The Noble Garden) ===\nThe Raw\u1e0dah ash-Sharifah (Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641\u0629\u200e, lit. 'The Noble Garden') is an area between the minbar and burial chamber of Muhammad. It is regarded as one of the Riy\u0101\u1e0d al-Jannah (Arabic: \u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0636 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0629\u200e, lit. 'Gardens of Paradise'). A green carpet distinguishes the area from the rest of the mosque, which is covered in a red carpet. Considering visiting Madinah and performing the Ziyarah, Muhammad said: \u201cWhoever visits me after my death is like he who had visited me during my life.\u201d\n\u201cWhen a person stands at my grave reciting blessings on me, I hear it; and whoever calls for blessings on me in any other place, his every need in this world and in the hereafter is fulfilled and on the day of Qiyamah I shall be his witness and intercessor.\u201dPilgrims attempt to visit the confines of the area, for there is a tradition that supplications and prayers uttered here are never rejected. Access into the area is not always possible, especially during the Hajj season, as the space can only accommodate a few hundred people and movement is restricted by policemen.\n\n\n=== Green Dome ===\n\nThe chamber adjacent to the Rawdah holds the tombs of Prophet Muhammad and two of his companions, father-in-laws and caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar ibn \nal-Khattab. A fourth grave is reserved for \u2018\u012as\u0101 (Arabic: \u0639\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0633\u064e\u0649\u200e, Jesus), as Muslims believe that he will return and will be buried at the site. The site is covered by the Green Dome. It was constructed in 1817 CE during the reign of the Ottoman sultan Mahmud II and painted green in 1837 CE.\n\n\n=== Mihrab ===\n\nThere are two mihrabs or niches indicating the qibla (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0628\u200e, romanized: mihrab, lit. 'place of war') in the mosque, one was built by Muhammad and another was built by the third Rashidun caliph Uthman. The one built by the latter was larger than that of Muhammad's and acts as the functional mihrab, whereas Muhammad's mihrab is a \"commemorative\" mihrab. Besides the mihrab, the mosque also has other niches which act as indicators for praying. This includes the Mi\u1e25r\u00e2b F\u00e2\u1e6dimah (Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0640\u062d\u0652\u0640\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064e\u0640\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0640\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0629\u200e) or Mi\u1e25r\u0101b a\u1e6b-\u1e6aahajjud (Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0640\u062d\u0652\u0640\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0640\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0640\u0647\u064e\u0640\u062c\u064f\u0651\u0640\u062f\u200e), which was built by Muhammad for the \u1e6aahajjud (late-night) prayer (Arabic: \u062a\u064e\u0640\u0647\u064e\u0640\u062c\u064f\u0651\u0640\u062f\u200e).\n\n\n=== Minbar ===\nThe original minbar (Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0640\u0646\u0640\u06e2\u0628\u064e\u0640\u0631\u200e) used by Muhammad was a block of date palm wood. This was replaced by him with a tamarisk one, which had dimensions of 50 cm \u00d7 125 cm (20 in \u00d7 49 in). In 629 CE, a three staired ladder was added to it. The first two caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar, did not use the third step as a sign of respect to the Prophet, but the third caliph Uthman placed a fabric dome over it and the rest of the stairs were covered with ebony. The minbar was replaced by Baybars I in 1395, and later by Shaykh al-Mahmudi in 1417. This was also replaced by a marble one by Qaitbay in the late fifteenth century, which as of 2013, is still used in the mosque.\n\n\n=== Minarets ===\nThe first minarets (four in number) of 26 feet (7.9 m) high were constructed by Umar. In 1307, a minaret titled Bab al-Salam was added by Muhammad ibn Kalavun which was renovated by Mehmed IV. After the renovation project of 1994, there were ten minarets which were 104 metres (341 ft) high. The minarets' upper, bottom and middle portion are cylindrical, octagonal and square shaped respectively.\n\n\n== Imams and mu'ezzins ==\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\nPictures of al-Masjid an-Nabawi\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBurial places of founders of world religions\nDestruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nHoliest sites in Islam (Shia)\nHoliest sites in Islam (Sunni)\nIslamic art\nList of mosques\nList of mosques in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nAriffin, Syed Ahmad Iskandar Syed (2005).

The complex consists of six mosques in spite of the name \"Sab'ah\" means \"seven\", because it included the Masjid al-Qiblatayn originally. Although the mosque is often visited by pilgrims, Sunni sources claim that there are no accounts in the order from the Islamic prophet Muhammad or in Sharia regarding the virtue of visiting these mosques. As a result, religious police have been stationed at the mosques visited by Shias. Prominent Shia sites have been demolished as well. \n\n\n== Location ==\nThese mosques are located in south of Mount Sala' which was the scene of the Battle of the Trench.\n\n\n== Mosques in the complex ==\n\n\n=== Al-Fath Mosque ===\nThis is the largest mosque of all, and it is located beneath of Mount Sala' on the western part. It is narrated that this mosque is named as \"Al-Fath\" due to the account of the prophet praying here during the Battle of the Trench, and the battle ended in Muslim victory (in Arabic, \"Fath\" or \"Fatah\" means \"conquest\" in Islamic context). The mosque was built during the time of the Caliph Umar bin Abdul Aziz, and renovated by the minister Saifuddin Abu al-Hija in 1154 during the time of the Sharifate of Mecca.\n\n\n=== Salman Al-Farsi Mosque ===\nLocated 20 meters south of Al-Fath Mosque, named after Salman Al-Farsi who lead the construction of trenches during the Battle of the Trench. The mosque is built during the time of Caliph Umar bin Abdul Aziz, and renovated by the minister Saifuddin Abu al-Hija in 1154 during the time of the Sharifate of Mecca.\n\n\n=== Abu Bakr As-Siddiq Mosque ===\nIt is located 15 meters southeast of Salman Al-Farsi Mosque. These three mosques (Al-Fath Mosque, Salman Al-Farsi Mosque and Abu Bakr As-Siddiq Mosque) were demolished and renovated into one mosque with wider space.\n\n\n=== Umar bin Khattab Mosque ===\nIt is located 10 meters south of Abu Bakar As-Siddiq Mosque. This mosque is situated on higher altitude, and its look is corresponding to Al-Fath Mosque, thus it is considered that they were built and renovated at the same time.\n\n\n=== Sa'ad bin Ma'az Mosque ===\n\n\n=== Ali bin Abi Talib Mosque ===\nLocated in the south of Fathimah Az-Zahra Mosque on a small hill. This mosque has a length of 8.5 meters and width of 6.5 meters. It is narrated that Ali joined the Battle of the Trench here. Today, local government of Medina is renovating this mosque while maintaining the original shape, and building a large park surrounding it as a decoration of the small building.\n\n\n=== Fatimah Az-Zahra Mosque ===\nIt is a small mosque attached to the others, with area of 4x3 meters.

It is located to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, which contains the graves of some of Muhammad's family and friends. It is also known as Baq\u012b\u02bf al-Gharqad (Arabic: \u0628\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u063a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0642\u064e\u062f\u200e, meaning \"Baqi\u02bf of the Boxthorn\").The grounds hold much significance for Muslims, being the resting place of many of Muhammad's relatives and companions, thus making it as one of the two holiest cemeteries in Islamic tradition. Many narrations relate Muhammad issuing a prayer every time he passed it.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen Muhammad arrived at Medina from Mecca in September 622 CE, al-Baqi' was a land covered with Lycium shawii boxthorn trees. According to historical records, after the arrival of Muhammad, the houses of Medina developed near al-Baqi', which was therefore considered as the public tomb. The bramble-growth was cleared and the place consecrated to be the future cemetery of the Muslims who died at al-Madina. Also al-Baqi' was introduced as somewhere whose east side is Nakhl and west side contains houses. In fact, before demolition al-Baqi' was located behind the houses in the city.During the construction of the Prophet's Mosque, on the site he purchased from two orphan children when he arrived after his migration from Mecca to Medina, Es'ad bin Zurarah, one of Muhammad's companions died. Muhammad chose the spot to be a cemetery and Es'ad was the first individual to be buried in al-Baqi' among the Ansar.\nWhile Muhammad was outside Medina for the Battle of Badr, his daughter Ruqayyah fell sick and died in 624. She was buried in al-Baqi'. She was the first person from Ahl al-Bayt (Household of Muhammad) buried in this cemetery.\nShortly after Muhammad arrived from Badr, Uthman bin Maz'oon died in 5/626-7 and was buried in al-Baqi'. He was considered the first companion of Muhammad from the Muhajirun to be buried in the cemetery. He was also called by the Prophet to be the first 'among us to go to the hereafter', and he also called the place where he is buried Rawh\u0101. When his son died, he commanded that he be buried there also; he watered the grave and called this place Zawr\u0101.Initially, Caliph Uthman ibn Affan was buried in the huge neighbouring Jewish graveyard. The first enlargement of al-Baqi' in history was made by Muawiyah I, the first Umayyad Caliph. In order to honour Uthman ibn Affan, Muawiyah included the huge Jewish graveyard into al-Baqi' cemetery. The Umayyad Caliphate built the first dome in al-Baqi' over his grave. During different times of history, many domes and structures were built or rebuilt over many famous graves in al-Baqi'.\n\n\n=== Demolition ===\n\n\n==== First demolition ====\n\nThe cemetery was demolished by forces loyal to the Wahhabi-Saudi alliance in 1806 and 1925 (or 1926).At the beginning of the Wahhabis of Najd's nineteenth century (1806) control over Mecca and Medina, they demolished many of the religious buildings including tombs and mosques, whether inside or outside the Baqi, in accordance with their doctrine. These were razed to the ground and plundered for their decorations and goods.\n\n\n==== Second demolition ====\nThe clan of Saud regained control of the Hijaz in 1924 or 1925. The following year King Ibn Saud granted permission to destroy the site with religious authorization provided by Qadi Abd Allah ibn Bulayhid, and the demolition began on 21 April 1926 (or 1925) by Ikhwan (\"The Brothers\"), a Wahabbi religious militia. The demolition included destroying \"even the simplest of the gravestones\". British convert Eldon Rutter compared the demolition to an earthquake: \"All over the cemetery nothing was to be seen but little indefinite mounds of earth and stones, pieces of timber, iron bars, blocks of stone, and a broken rubble of cement and bricks, strewn about.\"The second demolition was discussed in Majles-e Shora-ye Melli (The National Consultative Assembly of Iran) and a group of representatives was sent to Hijaz to investigate. In recent years, efforts were made by Iranian religious scholars and political figures to restore the cemetery and its shrines. Both Sunni and Shia protested against the destruction and rallies are held annually. The day is regarded as Yaum-e Gham (\"Day of Sorrow\"). Prominent Sunni theologians and intellectuals have condemned the \"unfit\" situation of the Baqi cemetery but the Saudi authorities have so far ignored all criticism and rejected any requests for restoration of the tombs and mausoleums.\nThough nowadays the situation of the Baqi is better than the time of demolition but there was acrimony in the memories of the Muslims who visited there in the past.\n\n\n=== People of Prophet Muhammad that are buried there ===\nHalimah the milk-mother and nurse of Muhammad\nAll of the wives of Muhammad, except Khadijah bint Khuwaylid and Maymunah bint al-Harith who are buried in Jannatul Mualla in Mecca and at Sarif respectively.\nIbrahim, Muhammad's son by Maria al-Qibtiyya, died in infancy\nRoqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Zainab daughters of Muhammad and Khadija\nFatima, the daughter of Muhammad is purportedly buried there, though the location of her grave is disputed.\nFatima bint al-Asad, aunt of Muhammad and mother of Caliph and Imam Ali.\n\u2018Abbas ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, uncle of Muhammad.\nUmm ul-Banin, who married Caliph Ali after the death of Fatimah and Safiyyah, Atika aunts of Muhammad.\nHasan ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad, son of Fatimah bint Muhammad and Imam Ali.\nZayn al-Abidin, the grandson of Fatima bint Muhammad who is the only adult male that survived the Battle of Karbala because he was sick and could not fight.\nMuhammad al-Baqir, son of \u2018Al\u012b ibn \u1e24usayn.\nJa'far as-Sadiq, son of Muhammad al-Baqir.\nAbdullah son of Jaffar at-Tayyar, who was husband of Zainab, daughter of Ali and nephew of Ali\n(martyrs of Karbala).\nAqeel ibn Abi Talib, the elder brother of Ali.\nUthman ibn Affan, early companion, second cousin, twice son-in-law of Muhammad, brother-in-law of first Imam Ali and third Sunni Caliph.

'Mosque of the Two Qiblas'), also spelt Masjid al-Qiblatain, is a mosque in Medina believed by Muslims to be the place where the final Islamic prophet, Muhammad, received the command to change the Qibla (direction of prayer) from Jerusalem to Mecca. The mosque was built by Sawad ibn Ghanam ibn Ka'ab in during the year 2 AH (623 CE) and is one of the few mosques in the world to have contained two mihrabs (niches indicating the qibla) in different directions.\nAs part of a renovation in 1988, during the reign of King Fahd, the old prayer niche facing Jerusalem was removed, and the one facing Mecca was left. The Qiblatayn Mosque is among the earliest mosques that date to the time of Muhammad, along with the Quba'a Mosque and Masjid an-Nabawi, considering that the Great Mosques of Mecca and Jerusalem are associated with earlier Prophets in Islamic thought.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe mosque is among the earliest mosques in Medina and was built by Sawad ibn Ghanam ibn Ka'ab al-Ansari in the Islamic year 2 AH, and the name of the mosque goes back to the lifetime of Muhammad, when his companions named it after an event that took place on the 15th of Sha'baan the same year, when Muhammad received revelation from Allah instructing him to take the Kaaba as the qibla during the Dhuhr prayer, instead of the qibla of the Jews, which was the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. He later announced this to his companions in his own mosque, after which the news began to spread. Many pilgrims who go to Mecca for Hajj often visit Medina, where some visit this mosque because of its historical significance.Indeed, We see you \u02faO Prophet\u02fa turning your face towards heaven. Now We will make you turn towards a \u02fadirection of prayer\u02fa that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque \u02fain Mecca\u02fa\u2014wherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture certainly know this to be the truth from their Lord. And Allah is never unaware of what they do.\n\u2013 Qur'an, 2:144 (translated by Mustafa Khattab)A hadith from Sahih Bukhari says:\nNarrated Ibn Umar:\nWhile some people were offering Fajr prayer at Quba' (mosque), some-one came to them and said, \"Tonight some Qur'anic Verses have been revealed to the Prophet and he has been ordered to face the Kaaba (during prayers), so you too should turn your faces towards it.\" At that time their faces were towards Shaam (Jerusalem) so they turned towards the Kaaba (at Mecca).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe main prayer hall adopts rigid orthogonal geometry and symmetry which is accentuated by the use of twin minarets and twin domes. Living accommodations for the Imam, the Muezzin and the caretaker are discretely grouped in one block to the west of the main structure. The difference in level at the southeast corner of the site has been exploited to incorporate a sub-basement level which serves as the ablutions area for worshippers. To the north, where the ground level is lower, the prayer hall is raised one-storey above ground level. Entry to the prayer hall is from the raised courtyard, also to the north, which can be reached by stairs and ramps from the main directions of approach. The prayer hall consists of a series of arches which support barrel-vaults running parallel to the qibla wall. These vaults are interrupted by two domes which establish an axis in the direction of Mecca.The main dome to the south is raised on a drum of clerestory windows which allow light to filter into the interior directly above the mihrab. The second, false dome is linked to the first by a small cross-vault to symbolise the transition from one qibla to another. Below it, a replica of the mihrab found in the lower chamber of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem reminds onlookers of the oldest extant mihrab of Islam. Externally, the architectural vocabulary is inspired by traditional elements and motifs in a deliberate effort to offer an authentic image for the historic site. The mosque is located on the north-west of the city of Medina, on Khalid ibn al-Walid Road. The mosque was initially maintained by Caliph Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b. The last pre-modern renovation was by Suleiman the Magnificent who reconstructed the mosque.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHoliest sites in Islam\nIslamic architecture\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nTimeline of Muslim history\nList of mosques in Saudi Arabia\nLists of mosques\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDescription at Archnet.com with plans and pictures.",

        "wiki": "Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0622\u0644 \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u200e, romanized: Mu\u1e25ammad bin Salm\u0101n bin \u2018Abd al-\u2018Az\u012bz \u0100l Sa\u2018\u016bd; born 31 August 1985), colloquially known as MBS, is the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He is currently serving as the country's deputy prime minister (the title of prime minister being held by the king) and is also Chairman of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs, Chairman of the Council of Political and Security Affairs, and Minister of Defence \u2013 the world's youngest at the time of his appointment. He has been described as the power behind the throne of his father, King Salman. He was appointed crown prince in June 2017 following King Salman's decision to remove Muhammad bin Nayef from all positions, making Mohammed bin Salman heir-designate to the throne.He has led several successful reforms, which include regulations restricting the powers of the religious police, the removal of the ban on female drivers in June 2018, and weakening the male-guardianship system in August 2019. Other cultural developments under his reign include the first Saudi public concerts by a female singer, the first Saudi sports stadium to admit women, an increased presence of women in the workforce, and opening the country to international tourists by introducing an e-visa system, allowing foreign visas to be applied for and issued via the Internet. His Vision 2030 program aims to diversify the Saudi economy through investment in non-oil sectors including technology and tourism. In 2016, he announced plans to list the shares of the state oil company Saudi Aramco.Despite praise for his strides towards the social and economic liberalisation of Saudi Arabia, international commentators and human rights groups have been openly critical of bin Salman's leadership and the shortfalls of his reform program, citing a rising number of detentions and alleged torture of human rights activists, his bombing of Yemen in which war-induced famine could cause 13 million civilians to starve, the escalation of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, the start of the Lebanon\u2013Saudi Arabia dispute, the start of a diplomatic spat with Canada, the arrest of members of the Saudi royal family in November 2017, a crackdown on feminists, and the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. He has been described by observers as an autocratic leader, with no tolerance for dissent against him or the Saudi royal family.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMohammed bin Salman Al Saud was born on 31 August 1985. He is the son of King Salman from his third spouse, Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan bin Hathleen. She is a granddaughter of Rakan bin Hithalayn, who was the head of the Al Ajman tribe. In 1915 the Al Ajman tribe led by him fought with the Al Saud during which King Abdulaziz's only full-brother Saad bin Abdul Rahman was killed.Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the eldest among his mother's children and is the eighth child and seventh son of his father; his full siblings include Turki bin Salman, former chairman of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group, and Khalid bin Salman. Prince Mohammed holds a bachelor's degree in law from King Saud University.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter graduating from college, Mohammed bin Salman spent several years in the private sector before becoming personal aide to his father. He worked as a consultant for the Experts Commission, working for the Saudi Cabinet.On 15 December 2009, at the age of 24, Mohammed bin Salman entered politics as a special advisor to his father when the latter was the governor of Riyadh Province. At this time Mohammed bin Salman began to rise from one position to another, such as secretary-general of the Riyadh Competitive Council, special advisor to the chairman of the board for the King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives, and a member of the board of trustees for Albir Society in the Riyadh region.In October 2011, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz died, and the current King Salman began his ascent to power by becoming Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence in November 2011. He made Mohammed bin Salman his private advisor.\n\n\n==== Chief of the Court ====\nIn June 2012, Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud died and Prince Mohammed bin Salman moved up into the number two position in the hierarchy, as his father became the new crown prince and first deputy prime minister. He soon began remaking the court in his own image. On 2 March 2013, the chief of the Crown Prince court Prince Saud bin Nayef was appointed governor of the Eastern Province and Prince Mohammed bin Salman succeeded him in the post. He was also given the rank of minister. On 25 April 2014, Prince Mohammed was appointed state minister.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\n\n=== Minister of Defence and Deputy Crown Prince ===\n\nOn 23 January 2015, King Abdullah died, Salman took the throne and Prince Mohammed bin Salman was appointed minister of defence. He was also named as the secretary general of the Royal Court on the same date. In addition, he retained his post as the minister of state.In Yemen, the political unrest (which began escalating in 2011) rapidly became a major issue for the newly appointed minister of defence, with Houthis taking control of northern Yemen in late 2014, followed by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and his cabinet's resignation. Mohammed bin Salman's first move as minister was to mobilise a pan-GCC coalition to intervene following a series of suicide bombings in Sana'a via air strikes against Houthis, and impose a naval blockade. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia began leading a coalition of countries allied against the Houthi rebels. While there was agreement among those Saudi princes heading security services regarding the necessity of a response to the Houthis' seizure of Sana'a, which had forced the Yemeni government into exile, Prince Mohammed launched the intervention without full coordination across security services. Saudi National Guard minister Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who was out of the country, was left out of the loop of operations. While Prince Mohammed bin Salman sold the war as a quick win on Houthi rebels in Yemen and a way to put President Hadi back in power, however, it became a long war of attrition.In April 2015, Muhammad bin Nayef, who is King Salman's nephew, and Prince Mohammed bin Salman became Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince, respectively.In late 2015, Prince Mohammed attended a meeting between King Salman and U.S. President Barack Obama, where the prince broke protocol to deliver a monologue criticizing U.S. foreign policy. When Prince bin Salman announced an anti-terrorist military alliance of Islamic countries in December 2015, some of the countries involved said they had not been consulted.\n\nRegarding his role in the military intervention, Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave his first on-the-record interview on 4 January 2016 to The Economist, which had called him the \"architect of the war in Yemen\". Denying the title, he explained the mechanism of the decision-making institutions actually holding stakes in the intervention, including the council of security and political affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Saudi side. He added that the Houthis usurped power in the Yemeni capital Sana'a before he served as minister of defence.In response to the threat from ISIL, In December 2015 Prince Mohammed established the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC), a Saudi-led Islamic alliance against terrorism. The IMCTC's first meeting took place in Riyadh in November 2017 and involved defence ministers and officials from 41 countries.\n\n\n=== Crown Prince ===\nMohammed bin Salman was appointed Crown Prince on 21 June 2017, following his father's decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef, making him heir presumptive to the throne. The change of succession had been predicted in December 2015 by an unusually blunt and public memo published by the German Federal Intelligence Service, which was subsequently rebuked by the German government.On the day he became Crown Prince, U.S. President Donald Trump called Mohammed bin Salman to \"congratulate him on his recent elevation\". Trump and the new crown prince pledged \"close cooperation\" on security and economic issues, according to the White House, and the two leaders also discussed the need to cut off support for terrorism, the recent diplomatic dispute with Qatar, and the push to secure peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Mohammed bin Salman told the Washington Post in April 2017 that without America's cultural influence on Saudi Arabia, \"we would have ended up like North Korea.\"\n\n\n=== 2017 purge ===\n\nIn May 2017, Mohammed bin Salman publicly warned \"I confirm to you, no one will survive in a corruption case\u2014whoever he is, even if he's a prince or a minister\". In November 2017, he ordered some 200 wealthy businessmen and princes to be placed under house arrest in Riyadh's Ritz Carlton hotel. On 4 November 2017, the Saudi press announced the arrest of the Saudi prince and billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal, a frequent English-language news commentator and a major shareholder in Citi, News Corp and Twitter, as well as over 40 princes and government ministers at the behest of the Crown Prince on corruption and money laundering charges.Others arrested or fired in the purge included Mutaib bin Abdullah, head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, Adel Fakeih, the Minister of Economy and Planning, and the Commander of the Saudi Naval Forces, Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan.One hypothesis for the arrests was that they were part of a power grab on the part of Salman. The New York Times wrote:\n\nThe sweeping campaign of arrests appears to be the latest move to consolidate the power of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the favorite son and top adviser of King Salman. The king had decreed the creation of a powerful new anticorruption committee, headed by the crown prince, only hours before the committee ordered the arrests. Writing for The Huffington Post, University of Delaware professor of Islam and Global Affairs, Muqtedar Khan, speculated as to whether the removal of Talal, a critic of Donald Trump, amounted to a coup. BBC correspondent Frank Gardner was quoted as saying that \"Prince Mohammed is moving to consolidate his growing power while spearheading a reform programme\". Yet \"[i]t is not clear what those detained are suspected of.\"Another hypothesis was that the purge was part of a move towards reform. Steven Mufson of The Washington Post argues that Crown Prince Mohammed \"knows that only if he can place the royal family under the law, and not above as it was in the past, can he ask the whole country to change their attitudes relative to taxes [and] subsidies.\" An analysis from the CBC claimed that \"the clampdown against corruption resonates with ordinary Saudis who feel that the state has been asking them to accept belt tightening while, at the same time, they see corruption and the power elite accumulating more wealth\". Bin Salman's ambitious reform agenda is widely popular with Saudi Arabia's burgeoning youth population but faces resistance from some of the old guard more comfortable with the kingdom's traditions of incremental change and rule by consensus. According to a former British ambassador to Riyadh, Mohammed bin Salman \"is the first prince in modern Saudi history whose constituency has not been within the royal family, it's outside it. It's been young Saudis, particularly younger Saudi men in the street\". The 2018 Arab Youth Survey found that nine out of ten 18\u201324 year-olds in the MENA region support Bin Salman's campaign against corruption.Robert Jordan, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said that \"certainly Saudi Arabia has had a corruption problem for many years. I think the population, especially, has been very unhappy with princes coming in and grabbing business deals, with public funds going to flood control projects that never seem to get built... I would also say it's a classical power grab move sometimes to arrest your rivals, your potential rivals under the pretext of corruption\".US President Trump expressed support for the move, tweeting \"I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing....Some of those they are harshly treating have been 'milking' their country for years!\" French President Macron, who visited Riyadh days after the purge, when asked about the purge stated \"this is not the role of a president, and similarly I would not expect a leader of a foreign country to come and infringe on domestic matters,\"On 30 January 2019, the Saudi government announced the conclusion of Anti-Corruption Committee's work.\n\n\n== Political, economic, and social changes ==\nPrince Mohammed's ideology has been described as nationalist and populist, with a conservative attitude towards politics, and a liberal stance on economic and social issues. It has been heavily influenced by the views of his former adviser Saud al-Qahtani and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. His style of ruling has been described as extremely brutal by journalist Rula Jebreal and authoritarian by Jamal Khashoggi and Theodor Winkler.On 29 January 2015, Prince Mohammed was named the chair of the newly established Council for Economic and Development Affairs, replacing the disbanded Supreme Economic Commission. In April 2015, Prince Mohammed bin Salman was given control over Saudi Aramco by royal decree following his appointment as deputy crown prince.In December 2017, Prince Mohammed criticised United States' decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.In March 2018, Prince Mohammed referred to Turkey as part of a \"triangle of evil\" alongside Iran and Muslim Brotherhood.In 2018, he voiced his support for a Jewish homeland. Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel. This is the first time that a senior Saudi royal has expressed such sentiments publicly. In September 2019, Mohammed condemned Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to annex the eastern portion of the occupied West Bank known as the Jordan Valley.\n\n\n=== Vision 2030 ===\n\nMohammed bin Salman took the leadership in the restructuring of Saudi Arabia's economy, which he officially announced in April 2016 when he introduced Vision 2030, the country's strategic orientation for the next 15 years. Vision 2030 plans to reform Saudi's economy towards a more diversified and privatised structure. It details goals and measures in various fields, from developing non-oil revenues and privatization of the economy to e-government and sustainable development.At the inaugural Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh in October 2017, bin Salman announced plans for the creation of Neom, a $500 billion economic zone to cover an area of 26,000 square kilometres on Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast, extending into Jordan and Egypt. Neom aims to attract investment in sectors including renewable energy, biotechnology, robotics and advanced manufacturing. The announcement followed plans to develop a 34,000 square kilometre area across a lagoon of 50 islands on Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coastline into a luxury tourism destination with laws on a par with international standards. In a further effort to boost the tourism industry, in November 2017 it was announced that Saudi Arabia would start issuing tourist visas for foreigners, beginning in 2018.Prince Mohammed bin Salman's biggest bet was his plan to restore the Saudi kingdom's dominance in global oil markets by driving the new competition into bankruptcy, by keeping the oil price low enough for a long enough period. Saudi Arabia persuaded OPEC to do the same. A few small players went bankrupt, but American frackers only shut down their less-profitable operations temporarily, and waited for oil prices to go up again. Saudi Arabia, which had been spending $100 billion a year to keep services and subsidies going, had to admit defeat in November 2016. It then cut production significantly and asked its OPEC partners to do the same.In the last week of September 2018, Mohammed bin Salman inaugurated the much-awaited $6.7bn high-speed railway line connecting Mecca and Medina, two holiest cities of Islam. The Haramain Express is 450 km line travelling up to 300 km/h that can transport around 60 million passengers annually. The commercial operations of the railway began on 11 October 2018.\n\nIn October 2018, Mohammed bin Salman announced that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia\u2019s assets were approaching $400 billion and would pass $600 billion by 2020.A project to build Saudi Arabia\u2019s first nuclear reactor was announced by bin Salman in November 2018. The kingdom aims to build 16 nuclear facilities over the next 20 years. Efforts to diversify the Saudi energy sector also include wind and solar, including a 1.8 gigawatt solar plant announced in the same month as part of a long term project in partnership with SoftBank.\n\n\n=== Domestic reforms ===\nMohammed bin Salman significantly restricted the powers of the religious police. He established an entertainment authority that began hosting comedy shows, professional wrestling events, and monster truck rallies. In 2016, he shared his idea for \"Green cards\" for non-Saudi foreigners with Al Arabiya journalist Turki al-Dakhil.\nIn 2019 Saudi cabinet approved a new residency scheme (Premium Residency) for foreigners. The scheme will enable expatriates to permanently reside, own property and invest in the Kingdom.In February 2017, Saudi Arabia appointed its first woman to head the Saudi Stock Exchange.In April 2017, bin Salman announced a project to build one of the world's largest cultural, sports and entertainment cities in Al Qidiya, southwest of Riyadh. The plans for a 334-square kilometre city include a safari and a Six Flags theme park.\n\nIn February 2018, it became legally possible for Saudi women to open their own business without a male's permission.According to the Saudi Information Ministry, as of March 2018, mothers in Saudi Arabia became authorised to retain immediate custody of their children after divorce without having to file any lawsuits.Further cultural developments followed in December 2017 with Saudi Arabia's first public concert by a female singer, and in January 2018 a sports stadium in Jeddah became the first in the Kingdom to admit women. In April 2018, the first public cinema opened in Saudi Arabia after a ban of 35 years, with plans to have more than 2,000 screens running by 2030.The first measures undertaken in April 2016 included new taxes and cuts in subsidies, a diversification plan, the creation of a $2 trillion Saudi sovereign wealth fund, and a series of strategic economic reforms called the National Transformation Programme. Bin Salman's plans to raise capital for the sovereign wealth fund included selling off shares of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned petroleum and natural gas company, with the capital to be re-invested in other sectors such as to implement the diversification plans. In October 2017, the plan for Aramco's IPO listing was criticised by The Economist, which called it \"a mess\".Mohammed bin Salman slashed the state budget, freezing government contracts and reducing the pay of civil employees as part of drastic austerity measures.In September 2017, bin Salman implemented the women to drive movement's multi-decade demand to lift the ban on female drivers. He legislated against some elements of Saudi Arabia's Wali system, also a topic of a many decade long campaign by women's rights activists.In October 2017, he said that the ultra-conservative Saudi state had been \"not normal\" for the past 30 years, blaming rigid doctrines that had governed society in a reaction to the Iranian Revolution, which successive leaders \"didn't know how to deal with\". According to him, he aimed to have Saudi Arabia start \"returning to what we were before\u2014a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world\". He was telling the country's clerics that the deal the royal family struck with them after the 1979 siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca was to be renegotiated. Building an industrial culture was not compatible with Wahhabism. The Wahhabis were committed to fixed social and gender relationships. These were consistent with an economy built on oil sales, but industrialization requires a dynamic culture with social relations constantly shifting.According to Politico, as of 2017, Mohammed bin Salman wished to pre-empt a repetition of the downfall of the earlier Saudi states due to familial infighting, internal malaise, external frailty and failure to modernise. Mindful of this history, instead of waiting for today's Saudi state to weaken and fall, MBS's aim was to try to save the country before it collapsed.Ayaan Hirsi Ali claimed that if bin Salman \"succeeds in his modernization efforts, Saudis will benefit from new opportunities and freedoms, and the world will benefit from curtailing the Wahhabi radicalization agenda. A decade from now, the kingdom could look more like the United Arab Emirates, its prosperous and relatively forward-looking neighbor.\"In response to the Saudi anti male-guardianship campaign, the Saudi Government enacted a law that allows women above 21 years old to obtain passports and travel abroad without needing the permission of their male guardians. The law will be effective by the end of August 2019.In an interview with a CBS 60 Minutes that aired on 29 September 2019, Mohammed bin Salman invited people to visit the Kingdom to see the transformation, asking for people to meet Saudi citizens for themselves.On 26 April 2020, the Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia abolished flogging as a punishment in the country, stating that the decision was \"an extension of the human rights reforms introduced under the direction of King Salman and the direct supervision of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\".On 27 April 2020 the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia reported the enactment of a royal decree abolishing death penalty for crimes committed by minors.\n\n\n=== Human rights ===\n\nAccording to human rights groups, arrests of human rights activists have risen under Mohammed bin Salman. Bin Salman has reportedly created the Tiger Squad, a team of assassins that act as a death squad, to target Saudi critics inside and outside Saudi Arabia.Among those detained in a wave of arrests in September 2017 were Abdulaziz al-Shubaily, a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA); Mustafa al-Hassan, an academic and novelist; and Essam al-Zamel, an entrepreneur.Ahead of the lifting of the ban on women driving in June 2018, 17 women's rights activists were arrested, including the women to drive and anti-male guardianship campaigner Loujain al-Hathloul. Eight of the 17 were subsequently released. Hatoon al-Fassi, an associate professor of women's history at King Saud University, was arrested shortly afterwards.In August that year, the human rights activist Israa al-Ghomgham and her husband \u2013 both arrested in 2015 \u2013 were put under legal threat of beheading. Human Rights Watch warned that the al-Ghomgham case set a \"dangerous precedent\" for other women activists currently detained. HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said, \"Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behaviour, is monstrous. Every day, the Saudi monarchy's unrestrained despotism makes it harder for its public relations teams to spin the fairy tale of 'reform' to allies and international business.\"On 23 April 2019, 37 people, mostly Shia human rights activists involved in the Qatif conflict, were executed in one of the largest mass executions of the minority sect in the kingdom's history.In August 2019, Loujain al-Hathloul's brother, Walid al-Hathloul informed that his sister was offered release on denying the human rights abuses committed against her in Saudi prison. Walid wrote on Twitter that the Saudi state security laid a proposal for Loujain to sign a document and appear on camera to deny that she had been tortured and sexually harassed in jail. He stated that Loujain mentioned to family that she had been whipped, beaten, electrocuted in a chair, and harassed by masked men, who would wake her up in the middle of the night to shout threats at her in cell. Walid also tweeted that Loujain refused the offer proposed by Saudi authorities and \u201cimmediately ripped the document\u201d.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Interventions in Syria and Yemen ===\n\nOn 10 January 2016, The Independent reported that \"the BND, the German intelligence agency, portrayed...Saudi defence minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman...as a political gambler who is destabilising the Arab world through proxy wars in Yemen and Syria.\" German officials reacted to the BND's memo, saying the published statement \"is not the position of the federal government\".\n\nMohammed bin Salman leads the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthi rebels, who in 2015 seized Sana\u2019a and ousted the Saudi-backed Hadi government, ending multilateral efforts towards a political settlement following the 2011 Yemeni uprising. Coalition airstrikes during the intervention have resulted in thousands of civilians killed or injured, prompting accusations of war crimes in the intervention.Following a Houthi missile attack against Riyadh in December 2017, which was intercepted by Saudi air defence, airstrikes killed 136 Yemeni civilians and injured 87 others in eleven days. In August 2018, the United Nations reported that all parties in the conflict were responsible for human rights violations and for actions which could be considered war crimes.Prince Mohammed is considered the architect of the war in Yemen. The war and blockade of Yemen has cost the kingdom tens of billions of dollars, further aggravated the humanitarian crisis in the country and destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, but failed to dislodge the Shiite Houthi rebels and their allies from the Yemeni capital. More than 50,000 children in Yemen died from starvation in 2017. From 2015 till May 2019 the number of total deaths of children is said to be approximately 85,000. The famine in Yemen is the direct result of the Saudi-led intervention and blockade of the rebel-held area. In October 2018, Lise Grande, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, warned that 12 to 13 million Yemenis were at risk of starvation if the war continued for another three months. On 28 March 2018, Saudi Arabia, along with its coalition partner the UAE, donated US$930 million to the United Nations which, according to UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, \"...(will) help to alleviate the suffering of millions of vulnerable people across Yemen\". The funds cover almost one-third of the $2.96 billion required to implement the UN's 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan. Following the Houthi missile attack against Riyadh in December 2017, which was intercepted by Saudi air defence, Mohammed Bin Salman retaliated with a ten-day barrage of indiscriminate airstrikes against civilian areas in Yemen held by Houthi forces, killing dozens of children.In August 2018, a report by The Intercept cited unnamed sources claiming that former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had in June 2017 intervened to stop a Saudi-Emirati plan to invade Qatar, resulting in increased pressure from Saudi Arabia and the UAE for his removal from office.\n\nFollowing the murder of Khashoggi, the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations approved a resolution to impose sanctions on people blocking humanitarian access in Yemen and suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Senator Lindsey Graham said America's relationship with Saudi Arabia \"is more of a burden than an asset.\" He also said, \"The crown prince [of Saudi Arabia] is so toxic, so tainted, so flawed.\"Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), said that Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson \"have played an utterly central and complicit role in arming and supporting the Saudi-led destruction of Yemen.\" Hunt's Conservative leadership campaign was partly funded by a close associate to Mohammed bin Salman.On 16 August 2020, a lawsuit filed by a former top intelligence official, Saad Aljabri, revealed that in 2015 Mohammed bin Salman secretly called for Russia to intervene in Syria at a time when Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime was close to falling apart. The Saudi monarchy had been supporting anti-Assad rebels, while Russians were bombing rebel-held cities in support of Assad, killing tens of thousands of Syrian civilians in the process. Western diplomats say that Mohammed bin Salman was strongly influenced by his Emirati counterpart, crown prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. The UAE was pushing for the idea of helping Russia stabilize Syria and enabling the Assad regime in the country. In 2017 it was reported that Saudi Arabia provided weapons to Syrian opposition groups, fighting against Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Conflict Armament Research (CAR) reported that these weapons frequently ended up in the hands of the Islamic State members. In 2018, Mohammed bin Salman reportedly wanted the US military presence to maintain in Syria, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s declaring the withdrawal of American forces from the war-torn country.\n\n\n=== 2016 U.S. presidential election and Trump presidency ===\nIn August 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with an envoy representing Mohammed bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. The envoy offered help to the Trump presidential campaign. The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince.\n\nUpon Trump's election, support for Mohammed bin Salman was described as one of the few issues where rival White House advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon agreed. Mohammed bin Salman was subsequently invited to the White House and given the treatment typically afforded to foreign heads of state by diplomatic protocol, while only holding the position of Deputy Crown Prince at the time. Prince Mohammed subsequently defended the Trump administration's travel ban for nationals of 7 Muslim-majority countries, stating that \"Saudi Arabia does not believe that this measure is targeting Muslim countries or the religion of Islam\". Kushner also inquired as to how the U.S. could support Prince Mohammed in the succession process. After Prince Mohammed acceded to Crown Prince, Trump reportedly said, \"We've put our man on top\". Trump initially supported the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, despite opposition from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, though he later changed his position. Prince Mohammed later reportedly claimed Kushner had provided intelligence assistance on domestic rivals to Prince Mohammed during the 2017\u201319 Saudi Arabian purge, which Trump had personally expressed support for. Trump and his administration also firmly supported Prince Mohammed during global backlash following the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\n=== Severed ties with Qatar ===\n\nReuters reported that Prince Mohammed \"said the dispute with Qatar could be long-lasting, comparing it to the U.S. embargo of Cuba imposed 60 years ago, but played down its impact, dismissing the Gulf emirate as \"smaller than a Cairo street\". Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar [in June 2017], suspending air and shipping routes with the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region's biggest U.S. military base.\"\n\n\n=== Forced resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister ===\nIn November 2017, Mohammed bin Salman forced the Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to resign when he visited Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Salman believed that Hariri was in the pocket of Iran-backed Hezbollah, which is a major political force in Lebanon. Hariri eventually was released, went back to Lebanon and annulled his resignation.\n\n\n=== Saudi\u2013Canadian conflict ===\n\nChrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement via Twitter on 2 August 2018 expressing Canada's concern over the recent arrest of Samar Badawi, a human rights activist and sister of imprisoned Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, and called for the release of human rights activists. In response to Canada's criticism, Saudi Arabia expelled Canada's ambassador, and froze trade with Canada. The Toronto Star reported that the consensus among analysts indicated that the actions taken by Mohammed bin Salman were a \"warning to the world \u2014 and to Saudi human rights activists \u2014 that his Saudi Arabia is not to be trifled with\".\n\n\n=== Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi ===\n\nIn October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and a critic of the crown prince, went missing after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials reportedly believe that Khashoggi was murdered at the consulate, claiming to have specific video and audio recordings proving that Khashoggi was first tortured and then murdered, and that a medical forensics expert was part of the 15-man Saudi team seen entering and leaving the consulate at the time of the journalist's disappearance. Saudi Arabia denied the accusations and Salman invited Turkish authorities to search the building as they \"have nothing to hide\". Saudi officials said they are \"working to search for him\". The Washington Post reported that the Crown Prince had earlier sought to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and detain him.According to Middle East Eye, seven of the fifteen men suspected of killing Khashoggi are members of Mohammed bin Salman's personal bodyguard. John Sawers, a former head of the British MI6, stated that in his judgment of the evidence it is \"very likely\" that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Khashoggi.In the aftermath of Khashoggi's death, multiple commentators referred to bin Salman as \"Mister Bone Saw,\" a play on the initials MBS. The name refers to the alleged use of a bone saw to dispose of Khashoggi's remains.Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement in the murder and blamed the assassination on rogue operators. However, Western countries are not convinced and believe this couldn't have happened without the knowledge or approval of the prince. Donald Trump described the Saudi response to the killing as \"one of the worst in the history of cover-ups.\" Trump also believes that the crown prince at least knew about the plan, saying \"Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him.\"After the murder, Mohammed bin Salman's close confidant Ahmad Asiri was sacked, as was former advisor Saud al-Qahtani.The recording of Khashoggi's killing collected by Turkish intelligence reportedly reveals that one of the members of the kill team instructed someone over the phone to \"tell your boss, the deed was done.\" American intelligence officials believe that \"boss\" was a reference to the crown prince. The person who made the call was identified as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a security officer who is frequently seen travelling with the prince.Seven weeks after Khashoggi's death, Saudi Arabia, in order to \"distance ... Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, from the grisly murder\" stated it would pursue the death penalty for five suspects charged with \"ordering and executing the crime.\"On 16 November 2018, it was reported that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had concluded with \"high confidence\" that Bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's murder. The CIA based its conclusion on several pieces of evidence, including an intercepted conversation in which Prince Mohammed's brother Khalid offered Khashoggi assurances that it would be safe for the journalist to enter Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul. Although the CIA reportedly had not determined whether Khalid had any foreknowledge of Khashoggi's ultimate fate upon entering the consulate, it believed that Khalid conveyed this message to Khashoggi at his brother's behest. In the CIA's analysis, the killing was most likely motivated by Prince Mohammed's privately stated belief that Khashoggi was an Islamist with problematic connections to the Muslim Brotherhood, a perception that differs markedly from the Saudi government's public remarks on Khashoggi's death.On 4 December 2018, a group of United States senators were briefed by CIA Director Gina Haspel on the murder of Khashoggi. After the briefing, senators were more than certain that Mohammed bin Salman played a major role in the killing of Khashoggi. GOP Senator Lindsey Graham said, \"You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organised by people under the command of MBS and that he was intrinsically involved in the demise of Mr. Khashoggi.\" Another GOP Senator Bob Corker said that the prince \"ordered, monitored, the killing\" and \"If he were in front of a jury, he would be convicted of murder in about 30 minutes.\" On 5 December 2018, UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet asked for an international investigation to determine who was behind the journalist's murder.A former Saudi intelligence chief and senior member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, dismissed the CIA's reported finding that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the journalist's killing, saying that \"The CIA has been proved wrong before. Just to mention the invasion of Iraq for example.\"In March 2019, US senators accused Saudi Arabia for a number of repetitive misdeeds and criticised the crown prince, saying he has gone \"full gangster\". The senators said the list of human rights violations by Saudi is too long that it has become difficult to comprehend what's happening in the kingdom or even work with MbS.In June 2019, a UN report linked bin Salman to the assassination.In a June 2019 article, The Guardian claimed that post Khashoggi's assassination, the media group became a target of hacking attempts made by a Saudi cybersecurity subdivision, as per an internal order document obtained by the group, with Saud al-Qahtani undersigned. According to an interview in a PBS documentary film recorded in December 2018 and parts released in September 2019, Mohammed bin Salman bears responsibility for the killing of Khashoggi since it happened under his watch but he denies any knowledge of the murder in advance. The prince denied in an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes, aired on 29 September 2019, any personal involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, adding that \"once charges are proven against someone, regardless of their rank, it will be taken to court, no exception made\", but said that he had to take \"full responsibility for what happened\".\n\n\n=== Intimidation of Saad AlJabri ===\nOn 9 July 2020, four senators of the United States urged President Donald Trump to secure the freedom of Saad Aljabri\u2019s children, Omar Aljabri and Sarah Aljabri, calling it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to support a man who aided the US intelligence for years and had close ties with key members of Saudi royal family. AlJabri\u2019s children were detained by Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s government in March 2020 and, to date, their whereabouts remain unknown. Saudi Arabia had issued an extradition request and Interpol notices to bring back Saad Aljabri, who was US\u2019 anti-terrorism contact in Middle East and was staying in Canada since 2018. The Interpol notice against Aljabri was removed, citing that he was a political opponent to Mohammed bin Salman.In August 2020, Saad Aljabri, a former top Saudi intelligence official filed a lawsuit in a Washington D.C. Federal Court that Mohammed bin Salman is alleged to have dispatched a 'Tiger Squad' to Canada during October 2018 to assassinate Saad, who was the closest adviser to MBS\u2019s chief rival, former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MBN. The squad was identified and returned back by Canadian authorities. Following the lawsuit filed by Aljabri, the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued the summons against the Saudi Crown Prince, along with 11 other people. The summons stated that a judgement would be taken by default against the concerned parties, if they fail to respond.\n\n\n=== China's camps for Muslims ===\nIn February 2019, Mohammed bin Salman defended China's Xinjiang re-education camps for Muslims, saying \"China has the right to carry out anti-terrorism and de-extremisation work for its national security.\" Salman's comments received severe criticism worldwide. China has imprisoned up to 2 million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China's north-western province of Xinjiang in concentration camps, where they are allegedly subjected to abuse and torture. Miqdaad Versi, spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain, called Prince Mohammed's remarks \"disgusting\" and a defence of \"the use of concentration camps against Uighur Muslims\".\n\n\n=== Hacking of Jeff Bezos ===\nIt was reported on 22 January 2020 that a multimedia message sent from the WhatsApp account that allegedly belonged to Mohammed bin Salman resulted in the hacking of Jeff Bezos' cellphone. According to forensic investigation, The Washington Post owner's phone was targeted with the malware containing video message months before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident critical of the government and a journalist/writer employed with The Post at the time of the hack. The analysis carried out by FTI Consulting, an advisory firm, was confirmed further by the United Nations' special rapporteur, Agn\u00e8s Callamard, who also investigated the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nMohammed bin Salman married his cousin, Princess Sarah bint Mashhoor bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, in 2008, and they have four children. In 2018 his personal net worth was estimated at US$3.0 billion.In 2015, he purchased the Italian-built and Bermuda-registered yacht Serene from Russian vodka tycoon Yuri Shefler for \u20ac500 million. In 2015, Mohammed purchased the Chateau Louis XIV in France for over $300 million.In December 2017, a number of sources reported that the Crown Prince, using his close associate Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Farhan as an intermediary, had bought the Salvator Mundi possibly by Leonardo da Vinci; the sale in November at $450.3 million set a new record price for a work of art. This report has been denied by the auctioneer Christie's, the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates, which has announced that it is the actual owner of the painting. The current location of the painting is unknown.Mohammed has travelled extensively around the world, meeting with politicians, business leaders and celebrities. In June 2016, he travelled to Silicon Valley and met key people in the US high tech industry, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.In early 2018, Prince Mohammed visited the United States, where he met with many politicians, business people and Hollywood stars, including President Trump, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Oprah Winfrey, Rupert Murdoch, Richard Branson, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, and Dwayne Johnson. President Trump praised his relationship with Prince Mohammed. Mohammed also visited the United Kingdom, where he met with Prime Minister Theresa May, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince William.Mohammed advocates fiscal austerity and leads a \"crackdown on corruption and self-enrichment\".\n\n\n== Honours ==\n  Bahrain: Member Exceptional Class of the Order of Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa (25 November 2018).\n  Tunisia: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Republic (28 November 2018).\n  Pakistan: Nishan-e-Pakistan (18 February 2019).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further information ==\n\nSaudi Deputy Crown Prince: The War Will Be Waged in Iran, Not Saudi Arabia; No to Direct Dialogue with Iran, MEMRI TV, 2017\nHubbard, Ben; Mark Mazzetti; Eric Schmitt (18 July 2017). \"Saudi King's Son Plotted Effort to Oust His Rival\".

        "wiki": "The Green Dome (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: al-Qubbah al-Kha\u1e0dr\u0101\u2019) is a green-coloured dome built above the tomb of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and early Muslim Caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar. The dome is located in the south-east corner of Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina.The structure dates back to 1279 CE, when an unpainted wooden cupola was built over the tomb. It was later rebuilt and painted using different colours twice in the late 15th century and once in 1817. The dome was first painted green in 1837, and hence became known as the Green Dome.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1279 CE or 678 AH during the reign of Mamluk Sultan Al Mansur Qalawun, the original structure was made out of wood and was colourless, painted white and blue in later restorations. After a serious fire struck the Mosque in 1481, the mosque and dome had been burnt and a restoration project was initiated by Sultan Qaitbay who had most of the wooden base replaced by a brick structure in order to prevent the collapse of the dome in the future, and used plates of lead to cover the new wooden dome. The building, including the Tomb of the Prophet, was extensively renewed through Qaitbay's patronage. The current dome was added in 1818 by the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II. The dome was first painted green in 1837.When Saud bin Abdul-Aziz took Medina in 1805, his followers, the Wahhabis, demolished nearly every tomb dome in Medina based on their belief that the veneration of tombs and places claimed to possess supernatural powers is an offense against tawhid. Muhammad's tomb was stripped of its gold and jewel ornaments, but the dome was preserved either because of an unsuccessful attempt to demolish its hardened structure, or because some time ago Ibn Abd al-Wahhab wrote that he did not wish to see the dome destroyed despite his aversion to people praying at the tomb. Similar events took place in 1925 when the Saudi militias retook\u2014and this time managed to keep\u2014the city. In 2007, according to The Independent, a pamphlet endorsed by the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia and published by the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs stated that \"the green dome shall be demolished and the three graves flattened in the Prophet's Masjid\". However, due to fear of extreme backlash and apprehended massive protests worldwide, it can not be implemented.\n\n\n== Tomb of Muhammad ==\n\nMuhammad's grave lies within the confines of what used to be his and his wife Aisha's house, the Hujra. During his lifetime it adjoined the mosque. The mosque was expanded during the reign of Caliph al-Walid I to include his tomb. Muhammad's grave is an important reason for the particular high sanctity of the mosque, as the Dome of the Prophet marks the location of the tomb. Millions visit it every year, since it is a tradition to visit the mosque after the pilgrimage to Mecca.The first two Caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar are buried next to Muhammad. Umar was given a spot next to Muhammad by Aisha, which had originally been intended for her.\nMuhammad's grave itself cannot be seen as the area is cordoned off by a gold mesh and black curtains\n\n\n== Panorama ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBurial places of founders of world religions\nDestruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Medina, officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0629\u200e, romanized: al-Madinat al-Munawwarah, lit. 'The Enlightened City'), commonly simplified as Mad\u012bnah or Madinah, is one of the three holiest cities in Islam and the capital of the Medina Region of Saudi Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782, making it the fourth-most populous city in the country. Located at the core of the Madinah Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293 km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys, agricultural spaces, older dormant volcanoes and the Nafud desert.\nThe city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in Islamic tradition, the other two being Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory. The original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib and it is referred to by the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab (The Confederates). It was renamed Mad\u012bnat an-Nab\u012b (City of the Prophet or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (The Enlightened City), before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in English as Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah al-Munawwarah interchangeably.The city is known to have existed for over 1500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca, otherwise known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), composed of the citizens of Madinah, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun, collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.Much like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short existence. The region is known to have been controlled by Arabian Jewish tribes (up to the 5th century CE), the 'Aws and Khazraj (up to Muhammad's arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622\u2013660 CE), Umayyads (660\u2013749 CE), Abbasids (749\u20131254 CE), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254\u20131517 CE), the Ottomans (1517\u20131805 CE), the First Saudi State (1805\u20131811 CE), Muhammad Ali Pasha (1811\u20131840 CE), the Ottomans for a second time (1840\u20131918), the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca (1918\u20131925 CE) and finally is in the hands of the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1925\u2013present CE).In addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi' cemetery and the Seven Mosques among others. Recently, after the Saudi conquest, the Saudis carried out a demolition of several tombs and domes in and around the region fearing these might become sites of association of others in worship beside Allah (shirk).\n\n\n== History ==\nMedina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n\n==== Yathrib ====\nBefore the advent of Islam, the city was known as Yathrib (pronounced [\u02c8ja\u03b8r\u026ab]; \u064a\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0628). The word Yathrib has been recorded in \u0100yah (verse) 13 of Surah (chapter) 33 of the Qur'an.[Quran 33:13] and is thus known to have been the name of the city up to the Battle of the Trench. Muhammad later forbade calling the city by this name.\n\n\n==== Taybah and Tabah ====\nSometime after the battle, the Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah (the Kind or the Good) ([\u02c8t\u02e4ajba]; \u0637\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629) and Tabah (Arabic: \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0629\u200e) which is of similar meaning. This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, \"Ya Taybah!\" (O Taybah!). The two names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the Kind).\n\n\n==== Madinah ====\nThe city has also been called Madinah in some ahadith. The names al-Mad\u012bnah an-Nabawiyyah (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629) and Mad\u012bnat un-Nab\u012b (both meaning \"City of the Prophet\" or \"The Prophet's City\") and al-Mad\u012bnat ul-Munawwarah (\"The Enlightened City\") are all derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in official documents and road signage, along with Madinah.\n\n\n=== Early history and Jewish control ===\nMedina is known to have been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BC. By the fourth century CE, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish tribes that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Qurayza, and Banu Nadir. Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian Empire's domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the Persian Shah.The situation changed after the arrival of two new Arab tribes, the 'Aws or Banu 'Aws and the Khazraj, also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but later revolted and became independent.\n\n\n=== Under the 'Aws and Khazraj ===\nToward the end of the 5th century, the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the 'Aws and the Khazraj. However, according to Scottish scholar, William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.Early Muslim chronicler Ibn Ishaq tells of an ancient conflict between the last Yemenite king of the Himyarite Kingdom and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognised the Ka'bah as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.Eventually the Banu 'Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's Hijrah (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the 'Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj. They fought a total of four wars.Their last and bloodiest known battle was the Battle of Bu'ath, fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. He was the most respected inhabitant of the city prior to Muhammad's arrival. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of Yathrib met secretly with Muhammad in 'Aqaba, a place outside Mecca, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to the city, where Muhammad could serve a mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n\n=== Under Muhammad and the Rashidun ===\n\nIn 622 CE (1 AH), Muhammad and an estimated 70 Meccan Muhajirun left Mecca over a period of a few months for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced the new religion of Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as the leader of the city. The natives of Yathrib who had converted to Islam of any background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called the Ansar (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the Zakat tax.\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, all parties in the area agreed to the Constitution of Medina, which committed all parties to mutual cooperation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess. In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as Kit\u0101b Dimmat al-Nabi, written in the 17th year of the Hijra (638 CE), and which gave express liberty to Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks. In return, they were to pay the jizya annually for protection by their patrons.\n\n\n==== Battle of Uhud ====\n\nIn the year 625 CE (3 AH), Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a senior chieftain of Mecca who later converted to Islam, led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the Qurayshi army with an estimated 1,000 troops, but just as the army approached the battlefield, 300 men under 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew, dealing a severe blow to the Muslim army's morale. Muhammad continued marching with his now 700-strong force and ordered a group of 50 archers to climb a small hill, now called Jabal ar-Rummaah (The Archers' Hill) to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry and to provide protection to the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to retreat. The frontline was pushed further and further away from the archers and foreseeing the battle to have be a victory for the Muslims, the archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading the rest to not disobey their Muhammad's orders.\nSeeing that the archers were starting to descend from the hill, Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded his unit to ambush the hill and his cavalry unit pursued the descending archers were systematically slain by being caught in the plain ahead of the hill and the frontline, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill who were shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but with little to no effect. However, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Madanis (people of Medina) suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.\n\n\n==== Battle of the Trench ====\n\nIn 627 CE (5 AH), Abu Sufyan led another force toward Medina. Knowing of his intentions, Muhammad asked for proposals for defending the northern flank of the city, as the east and west were protected by volcanic rocks and the south was covered with palm trees. Salman al-Farsi, a Persian Sahabi who was familiar with Sasanian war tactics recommended digging a trench to protect the city and the Prophet accepted it. The subsequent siege came to be became known as the Battle of the Trench and the Battle of the Confederates. After a month-long siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again due to the harsh winter.\nDuring the siege, Abu Sufyan contacted the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the Muslim defenders and effectively encircle the defenders. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Aws negotiated on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to appoint one of their chiefs who had converted to Islam, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason in the Book of Deutoronomy. This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The French historian Robert Mantran proposes that from this point of view it was successful\u2014from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.In the ten years following the hijra, Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he marched on Mecca, entering it without battle in 630 CE or 8 AH. Despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca, the growing importance of Mecca in Islam, the significance of the Ka'bah as the center of the Islamic world, as the direction of prayer (Qibla), and in the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the base of operations of the early Rashidun Caliphate.The city is presumed to have been renamed Madinat al-Nabi (\"City of the Prophet\" in Arabic) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and the city being the site of his burial. Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the Aramaic word Medinta, which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.\nUnder the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the reign of 'Uthman ibn al-Affan, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at some of his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE and assassinated him in his own home. Ali, the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in Iraq for being in a more strategic location. Since then, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power. Medina witnessed little to no economic growth during and after Ali's reign.\n\n\n=== Under subsequent Islamic regimes ===\n\n\n==== Umayyad Caliphate ====\nAfter al-Hasan, the son of 'Ali, ceded power to Mu'awiyah I, son of Abu Sufyan, Mu'awiyah marched into Kufa, Ali's capital, and received the allegiance of the local 'Iraqis. This is considered to be the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. Mu'awiyah's governors took special care of Medina and dug the 'Ayn az-Zarqa'a (\"Blue Spring\") spring along with a project that included the creation of underground ducts for the purposes of irrigation. Dams were built in some of the wadis and the subsequent agricultural boom led to the strengthening of the economy.\n\nFollowing a period of unrest during the Second Fitna in 679 CE (60 AH), Husayn ibn 'Ali was martyred at Karbala and Yazid assumed unchecked control for the next three years. In 682 CE (63 AH), Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself Caliph of Mecca and the people of Medina swore allegiance to him. This led to an eight-year-long period of economic distress for the city. In 692 CE (73 AH), the Umayyads regained power and Medina experienced its second period of huge economic growth. Trade improved and more people moved into the city. The banks of Wadi al-'Aqiq were now lush with greenery. This period of peace and prosperity coincided with the rule of 'Umar ibn Abdulaziz, who many consider to be the fifth of the Rashidun.\n\n\n==== Abbasid Caliphate ====\nAbdulbasit A. Badr, in his book, Madinah, The Enlightened City: History and Landmarks, divides this period into three distinct phases:\n\nBadr describes the period between 749\u2013974 CE (132\u2013363 AH) as a push-and-pull between peace and political turmoil, while Medina continued to pay allegiance to the Abbasids. From 974\u20131151 CE (363\u2013546 AH), Medina was in a liaison with the Fatimids, even though the political stand between the two remained turbulent and did not exceed the normal allegiance. From 1151 CE (546 AH) onwards, Medina paid allegiance to the Zengids, and the Emir Nuruddin Zangi took care of the roads used by pilgrims and funded the fixing of the water sources and streets. When he visited Medina in 1162 CE (557 AH), he ordered the construction of a new wall that encompassed the new urban areas outside the old city wall. Zangi was succeeded by Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, who supported Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Governor of Medina, and greatly funded the growth of the city while slashing taxes paid by the pilgrims. He also funded the Bedouins who lived on the routes used by pilgrims to protect them on their journeys. The later Abbasids also continued to fund the expenses of the city. While Medina was formally allied with the Abbasids during this period, they maintained closer relations with the Zengids and Ayyubids. The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2 m) high, dating from this period, and was flanked with towers. Of its four gates, the Bab al-Salam (\"The Gate of Peace\"), was remarked for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, the west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations.\n\n\n==== Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo ====\nAfter a brutal long conflict with the Abbasids, the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo took over the Egyptian governorate and effectively gained control of Medina. In 1256 CE (Rajab 654 AH), Medina was threatened by lava from the Harrat Rahat volcanic region but was narrowly saved from being burnt after the lava turned northward. During Mamluk reign, the Masjid an-Nabawi caught fire twice. Once in 1256 CE (654 AH), when the storage caught fire, burning the entire mosque, and the other time in 1481 CE (886 AH), when the masjid was struck by lightning. This period also coincided with an increase in scholarly activity in Medina, with scholars such as Ibn Farhun, Al-Hafiz Zain al-Din al-'Iraqi, Al Sakhawi and others settling in the city. The striking iconic Green Dome also found its beginnings as a cupola built under Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun as-Salihi in 1297 CE (678 AH).\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\n\n==== First Ottoman period ====\nIn 1517 CE (923 AH), the first Ottoman period began with Selim I's conquest of Mamluk Egypt. This added Medina to their territory and they continued the tradition of showering Medina with money and aid. In 1532 CE (939 AH), Suleiman the Magnificent built a secure fortress around the city and constructed a strong castle armed by an Ottoman battalion to protect the city. This is also the period in which many of the Prophet's Mosque's modern features were built even though it wasn't painted green yet. These suburbs also had walls and gates. The Ottoman sultans took a keen interest in the Prophet's Mosque and redesigned it over and over to suit their preferences.\n\n\n==== First Saudi insurgency ====\nAs the Ottomans' hold over their domains broke loose, the Madanis pledged alliance to Saud bin Abdulaziz, founder of the First Saudi state in 1805 CE (1220 AH), who quickly took over the city. In 1811 CE (1226 AH), Muhammad Ali Pasha, Ottoman commander and Wali of Egypt, commanded two armies under each of his two sons to seize Medina, the first one, under the elder Towson Pasha, failed to take Medina. But the second one, a larger army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, succeeded after battling a fierce resistance movement.\n\n\n==== Muhammad Ali Pasha's era ====\nAfter defeating his Saudi foes, Muhammad Ali Pasha took over governance of Medina and although he did not formally declare independence, his governance took on more of a semi-autonomous style. Muhammad's sons, Towson and Ibrahim, alternated in the governance of the city. Ibrahim renovated the city's walls and the Prophet's Mosque. He established a grand provision distribution center (taqiyya) to distribute food and alms to the needy and Medina lived a period of security and peace, In 1840 CE (1256 AH), Muhammad moved his troops out of the city and officially handed the city to the central Ottoman command.\n\n\n==== Second Ottoman period ====\n\nFour years in 1844 CE (1260 AH), after Muhammad Ali Pasha's departure, Davud Pasha was given the position of governor of Egypt under the Ottoman sultan. Davud was responsible for renovating the Prophet's mosque on Sultan Abdulmejid I's orders. When Abdul Hamid II assumed power, he made Medina stand out of the desert with a number of modern marvels, including a radio communication station, an power plant for the Prophet's Mosque and its immediate vicinity, a telegraph line between Medina and Istanbul, and the Hejaz railway which ran from Damascus to Medina with a planned extension to Mecca. Within one decade, the population of the city multiplied by leaps and bounds and reached 80,000. Around this time, Medina started falling prey to a new threat, the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca in the south. Medina witnessed the longest siege in its history during and after World War I.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Sharifate of Mecca and Saudi conquest ====\nThe Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, first attacked Medina on 6 June 1916 CE or 4 Sha'aban 1334 AH, in the middle of World War I. Four days later, Husayn held Medina in a bitter 3-year siege, during which the people faced food shortages, widespread disease and mass emigration. Fakhri Pasha, governor of Medina, tenaciously held on during the Siege of Medina from 10 June 1916 and refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the Armistice of Moudros, until he was arrested by his own men and the city was taken over by the Sharifate on 10 January 1919. Husayn largely won the war due to his alliance with the British. In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly dispatched the Sacred Relics of Muhammad to the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. As of 1920, the British described Medina as \"much more self-supporting than Mecca.\" After the Great War, the Sharif of Mecca, Sayyid Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, the people of Medina secretly entered an agreement with Ibn Saud in 1924, and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz conquered Medina as part of the Saudi conquest of Hejaz on 5 December 1925 (19 Jumada I 1344 AH) which gave way to the whole of the Hejaz being incorporated into the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n==== Under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ====\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focused more on the expansion of the city and the demolition of former sites that violated Islamic principles and Islamic law such as the tombs at al-Baqi. Nowadays, the city mostly only holds religious significance and as such, just like Mecca, has given rise to a number of hotels surrounding the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, which unlike the Masjid Al-\u1e24ar\u0101m, is equipped with an underground parking. The old city's walls have been destroyed and replaced with the three ring roads that encircle Medina today, named in order of length, King Faisal Road, King Abdullah Road and King Khalid Road. Medina's ring roads generally see less traffic overall compared to the four ring roads of Mecca.\n\nAn international airport, named the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport, now serves the city and is located on Highway 340, known locally as the Old Qassim Road. The city now sits at the crossroads of two major Saudi Arabian highways, Highway 60, known as the Qassim\u2013Medina Highway, and Highway 15 which connects the city to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk in the north and onward, known as the Al Hijrah Highway or Al Hijrah Road, after Muhammad's journey. The old Ottoman railway system was shutdown after their departure from the region and the old railway station has now been converted into a museum. The city has recently seen another connection and mode of transport between it and Mecca, the Haramain high-speed railway line connects the two cities via King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh, King Abdulaziz International Airport and the city of Jeddah in under 3 hours.\nThough the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, the Haram area of Medina itself is much smaller than that of Mecca and Medina has recently seen an increase in the number of Muslim and Non-Muslim expatriate workers of other nationalities, most commonly South Asian peoples and people from other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded al-Masjid an-Nabawi.\n\n\n==== Destruction of heritage ====\n\nSaudi Arabia is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to shirk (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old. Critics have described this as \"Saudi vandalism\" and claim that 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost in Medina and Mecca over the last 50 years. The most famous example of this is the demolition of al-Baqi.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMedina is located in the Hejaz region which is a 200 km (124 mi) wide strip between the Nafud desert and the Red Sea. Located approximately 720 km (447 mi) northwest of Riyadh which is at the center of the Saudi desert, the city is 250 km (155 mi) away from the west coast of Saudi Arabia and at an elevation of approximately 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. It lies at 39\u00ba36' longitude east and 24\u00ba28' latitude north. It covers an area of about 589 square kilometres (227 square miles). The city has been divided into twelve (12) districts, 7 of which have been categorised as urban districts, while the other 5 have been categorised as suburban.\n\n\n=== Elevation ===\nLike most cities in the Hejaz region, Medina is situated at a very high elevation. Almost three times as high as Mecca, the city is situated at 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Mount Uhud is the highest peak in Medina and is 1,077 meters (3,533 feet) tall.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains and volcanic hills. The soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly basalt, while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era.  It is surrounded by a number of famous mountains, most notably Jabal Al-Hujjaj (The Pilgrims' Mountain) to the west, Sal'aa Mountain to the north-west, Jabal al-'Ir or Caravan Mountain to the south and Mount Uhud to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the tripoint of the three valleys (wadis) of Wadi al 'Aql, Wadi al 'Aqiq, and Wadi al Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry deserted mountainous region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Medina falls in a hot desert climate region (BWh). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about 43 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) with nights about 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F). Temperatures above 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May. In summer, the wind is north-western, while in the spring and winters, is south-western.\n\n\n== Significance in Islam ==\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of two mosques, Masjid Quba'a and al-Masjid an-Nabawi. Both of these mosques were built by Muhammad himself. Islamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times in the Quran, two examples are Surah At-Tawbah. verse 101 and Al-Hashr. verse 8. Medinan suras are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts and they are also larger in number. Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in Sahih Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik said the Prophet said: \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people.\"\n\n\n=== The Prophet's Mosque (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) ===\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a prayer in The Prophet's Mosque equates to 1,000 prayers in any other mosque except the Masjid al-Haram where one prayer equates to 100,000 prayers in any other mosque. The mosque was initially just an open space for prayer with a raised and covered minbar (pulpit) built within seven months and was located beside the Prophet's rawdhah (residence, although the word literally means garden) to its side along with the houses of his wives. The mosque was expanded several times throughout history, with many of its internal features developed overtime to suit contemporary standards.\n\nThe modern Prophet's Mosque is famed for the Green Dome situated directly above the Prophet's rawdhah, which currently serves as the burial site for Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab and is used in road signage along with its signature minaret as an icon for Medina itself. The entire piazza of the mosque is shaded from the sun by 250 membrane umbrellas. \n\n\n=== Quba'a Mosque ===\n\nIt is Sunnah to perform prayer at the Quba'a Mosque. According to a hadith, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad said, \"Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\"\nand in another narration,\"Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque \u2013 meaning the Mosque of Quba\u2019 \u2013 and prays there, that will be equivalent to \u2018Umrah.\"It has been recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim that Muhammad used to go to Quba'a every Saturday to offer two rak'ahs of Sunnah prayer. The mosque at Quba'a was built by Muhammad himself upon his arrival to the old city of Medina. Quba'a and the mosque has been referred in the Qur'an indirectly in Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108.\n\n\n=== Other sites ===\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Qiblatayn ====\n\nMasjid al-Qiblatayn is another mosque historically important to Muslims. Muslims believe that Muhammad was commanded to change his direction of prayer (qibla) from praying toward Jerusalem to praying toward the Ka'bah at Mecca, as he was commanded in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 143 and 144. The mosque is currently being expanded to be able to hold more than 4,000 worshippers.\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Fath and the Seven Mosques ====\n\nThree of these historic six mosques were combined recently into the larger Masjid al-Fath with an open courtyard. Sunni sources claim that there is no hadith or any other evidence to prove that Muhammad may have said something about the virtue of these mosques.\n\n\n==== Al-Baqi' Cemetery ====\n\nAl-Baqi' is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of Muhammad, caliphs and scholars are known to have been buried.\n\n\n=== In Islamic eschatology ===\n\n\n==== End of civilization ====\nConcerning the end of civilization in Medina, Abu Hurairah is recorded to have said that Muhammad said:\"The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada'h, they will fall down on their faces dead.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 98)Sufyan ibn Abu Zuhair said Muhammad said:\"Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 99)\n\n\n==== Protection from plague and ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah) ====\n\nWith regards to Medina's protection from plague and ad-Dajjal, the following ahadith were recorded:\n\nby Abu Bakra:\"The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 103)by Abu Hurairah:\"There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 104)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2018, the recorded population was 2,188,138, with a growth rate of 2.32%. Being a destination of Muslims from around the world, Medina witnesses illegal immigration after performing Hajj or Umrah, despite the strict rules the government has enforced. However, the Central Hajj Commissioner Prince Khalid bin Faisal stated that the numbers of illegal staying visitors dropped by 29% in 2018.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion followed by the majority of the population of Medina.\nSunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali) constitute the majority, while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the Nakhawila. Outside the haram, there are significant numbers of Non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSimilar to that of Mecca, Medina exhibits a cross-cultural environment, a city where people of many nationalities and cultures live together and interact with each other on a daily basis. This only helps the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. Established in 1985, the biggest publisher of Quran in the world, it employs around 1100 people and publishes 361 different publications in many languages. It is reported that more than 400,000 people from around the world visit the complex every year. Every visitor is gifted a free copy of the Qur'an at the end of a tour of the facility.\n\n\n=== Museums and arts ===\nThe Al Madinah Museum has several exhibits concerning the cultural and historical heritage of the city featuring different archaeological collections, visual galleries and rare images of the old city. It is also includes the Hejaz Railway Museum. The Dar Al Madinah Museum opened in 2011 and it uncovers the history of Medina specializing in the architectural and urban heritage of the city. There is no archaeology or architecture from the time of Mohammed, except what remains of a few stone defensive towers The Holy Qur'an Exhibition houses rare manuscripts of the Quran, along with other exhibitions that encircle the Masjid an-Nabawi. \nThe Madinah Arts Center, founded in 2018 and operated by the MMDA's Cultural Wing, focuses on modern and contemporary arts. The center aims to enhance arts and enrich the artistic and cultural movement of society, empowering artists of all groups and ages. As of February 2020, before the implementation of social distancing measures and curfews, it held more than 13 group and solo art galleries, along with weekly workshops and discussions. The center is located in King Fahd Park, close to Quba Mosque on an area of 8,200 square meters (88,264 square feet)In 2018, the MMDA launched Madinah Forum of Arabic Calligraphy, an annual forum to celebrate Arabic calligraphy and renowned Arabic calligraphers. The event includes discussions about Arabic Calligraphy, and a gallery to show the work of 50 Arabic calligraphers from 10 countries. The Dar al-Qalam Center for Arabic Calligraphy is located to the northwest of the Masjid an-Nabawi, just across the Hejaz Railway Museum. In April 2020, it was announced that the center was renamed the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Center for Arabic Calligraphy, and upgraded to an international hub for Arabic Calligraphers, in conjunction with the \"Year of Arabic Calligraphy\" event organized by the Ministry of Culture during the years 2020 and 2021.Other projects launched by the MMDA Cultural Wing include the Madinah Forum of Live Sculpture held at Quba Square, with 16 sculptors from 11 countries. The forum aimed to celebrate sculpture as it is an ancient art, and to attract young artists to this form of art.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSaudi Arabia is renowned for its passion of football around the world. Medina hosts two football clubs, Al Ansar FC, and Ohod FC, with their shared home venue at Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Stadium.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHistorically, Medina's economy was dependent on the sale of dates and other agricultural activities. As of 1920, 139 varieties of dates were being grown in the area, along with other vegetables. Religious tourism plays a major part in Medina's economy, being the second holiest city in Islam, and holding many historical Islamic locations, it attracts more than 7 million annual visitors who come to perform Hajj during the Hajj season, and Umrah throughout the year.Medina has two industrial areas, the larger one was established in 2003 with a total area of 10,000,000 m2, and managed by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON). It is located 50 km from Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport, and 200 km from Yanbu Commercial Port, and has 236 factories, which produce petroleum products, building materials, food products, and many other products. The Knowledge Economic City (KEC) is a Saudi Arabian joint stock company founded in 2010. It focuses on real estate development and knowledge-based industries. The project is under development and is expected to highly increase the number of jobs in Medina by its completion.\n\n\n== Human resources ==\n\n\n=== Education and scholarly activity ===\n\n\n==== Primary and secondary education ====\nThe Ministry of Education is the governing body of education in the al-Madinah Province and it operates 724 and 773 public schools for boys and girls respectively throughout the province. Taibah High School is one of the most notable schools in Saudi Arabia. Established in 1942, it was the second-largest school in the country at that time. Many Saudi ministers and government officials have graduated from this high school, which gives it a reputation of excellence and historical importance.\n\n\n==== Higher education and research ====\nTaibah University is a public university providing higher education for the residents of the province, it has 28 colleges, of which 16 are in Medina. It offers 89 academic programs and has a strength of 69210 students as of 2020. The Islamic University, established in 1961, is the oldest higher education institution in the region, with around 22000 students enrolled. It offers majors in Sharia, Qur'an, Usul ad-Din, Hadith, and the Arabic language. The university offers Bachelor of Arts degrees and also Master's and Doctorate degrees. The admission is open to Muslims based on scholarships programs that provide accommodation and living expenses. In 2012, the university expanded its programs by establishing the College of Science, which offers Engineering and Computer science majors. Al Madinah College of Technology, which is governed by TVTC, offers a variety of degree programs including Electrical engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer Sciences and Electronic Sciences. Private universities at Medina include University of Prince Muqrin, the Arab Open University, and Al Rayyan Colleges.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nMedina is served by the Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz International Airport located off Highway 340. It handles domestic flights, while it has scheduled international services to regional destinations in the Middle East. It is the fourth-busiest airport in Saudi Arabia, handling 8,144,790 passengers in 2018. The airport project was announced as the world's best by Engineering News-Record's 3rd Annual Global Best Projects Competition held on September 10, 2015. The airport also received the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certificate in the MENA region. The airport receives higher numbers of passengers during the Hajj.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nIn 2015, the MMDA announced Darb as-Sunnah (Sunnah Path) Project, which aims to develop and transform the 3 km (2 mi) Quba'a Road connecting the Quba'a Mosque to the al-Masjid an-Nabawi to an avenue, paving the whole road for pedestrians and providing service facilities to the visitors. The project also aims to revive the Sunnah where Muhammed used to walk from his house (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) to Quba'a every Saturday afternoon.The city of Medina lies at the junction of two of the most important Saudi highways, Highway 60 and Highway 15. Highway 15 connects Medina to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk and Jordan in the north. Highway 60 connects the city with Yanbu, a port city on the Red Sea in the west and Al Qassim in the east. The city is served by three ring roads: King Faisal Road, a 5 km ring road that surrounds Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, King Abdullah Road, a 27 km road that surrounds most of urban Medina and King Khalid Road is the biggest ring road that surrounds the whole city and some rural areas with 60 km of roads.\n\n\n=== Bus and rapid transit ===\n\nThe bus transport system in Medina was established in 2012 by the MMDA and is operated by SAPTCO. The newly established bus system includes 10 lines connecting different regions of the city to Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, and serves around 20,000 passengers on a daily basis. In 2017, the MMDA launched the Madinah Sightseeing Bus service. Open top buses take passengers on sightseeing trips throughout the day with two lines and 11 destinations, including Masjid an-Nabawi, Quba'a Mosque and Masjid al-Qiblatayn and offers audio tour guidance with 8 different languages. By the end of 2019, the MMDA announced its plan to expand the bus network with 15 BRT lines. The project was set to be done in 2023. In 2015, the MMDA announced a three-line metro project in extension to the public transportation master plan in Medina.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe historic Ottoman railways were shutdown and the railway stations, including the one in Medina, were converted into museums by the Saudi government. The Haramain High Speed Railway (HHR) came into operation in 2018, linking Medina and Mecca, and passes through three stations: Jeddah, King Abdul Aziz International Airport, and King Abdullah Economic City. It runs along 444 kilometres (276 miles) with a speed of 300 km/h, and has an annual capacity of 60 million passengers.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMubarakpuri, Safiur Rahman (2011).

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Abu Bakr Abdullah ibn Uthman (Arabic: \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0628\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064d \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0639\u064f\u062b\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u200e; c. 573 CE \u2013 23 August 634 CE), was a companion and, through his daughter Aisha, a father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as well as the first of the Rashidun Caliphs.\nInitially a rich and respected businessman, Abu Bakr later became one of the first converts to Islam and extensively contributed his wealth in support of Muhammad's work. He was among Muhammad's closest companions, accompanying him on his migration to Medina and being present at a number of his military conflicts, such as the battles of Badr and Uhud.\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr succeeded in the leadership of the Muslim community as the first Rashidun Caliph. During his reign, he overcame a number of uprisings, collectively known as the Ridda wars, as a result of which he was able to consolidate and expand the rule of the Muslim state over the entire Arabian peninsula. He also commanded the initial incursions into the neighbouring Sassanian and Byzantine empires, which in the years following his death, would eventually result in the Muslim conquests of Persia and the Levant. Abu Bakr died of illness after a reign of 2 years, 2 months and 14 days.\n\n\n== Lineage and title ==\n\nAbu Bakr's full name was Abdullah ibn Uthman ibn Amir ibn Amr ibn Ka'b ibn Sa'd ibn Taym ibn Murrah ibn Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy Ghalib ibn Fihr.In Arabic, the name Abd Allah means \"servant of Allah\". One of his early titles, preceding his conversion to Islam, was Ateeq, meaning \"saved one\". Muhammad later restated this title when he said that Abu Bakr is the \"Ateeq\". He was called Al-Siddiq (the truthful) by Muhammad after he believed him in the event of Isra and Mi'raj when other people didn't, and Ali confirmed that title several times. He was also reportedly referred to in the Quran as the \"second of the two in the cave\" in reference to the event of hijra, where with Muhammad he hid in the cave in Jabal Thawr from the Meccan party that was sent after them.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAbu Bakr was born in Mecca sometime in 573 CE, to a rich family in the Banu Taym tribe of the Quraysh tribal confederacy. His father's name was Uthman and given the laqab Abu Quhafa, and his mother was Salma bint Sakhar who was given the laqab of  Umm ul-Khair.He spent his early childhood like other Arab children of the time, among the Bedouins who called themselves Ahl-i-Ba'eer- the people of the camel, and developed a particular fondness for camels. In his early years he played with the camel calves and goats, and his love for camels earned him the nickname (kunya) \"Abu Bakr\", the father of the camel's calf.Like other children of the rich Meccan merchant families, Abu Bakr was literate and developed a fondness for poetry. He used to attend the annual fair at Ukaz, and participate in poetical symposia. He had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the genealogy of the Arab tribes, their stories and their politics.A story is preserved that once when he was a child, his father took him to the Kaaba, and asked him to pray before the idols. His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said \"O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me\". The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol, saying, \"O God, give me some delicious food. See that I am so hungry\". The idol remained cold. That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr. He lifted a stone, and, addressing an idol, said, \"Here I am aiming a stone; if you are a god protect yourself\". Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the Kaaba. Regardless, it recorded that prior to converting to Islam, Abu Bakr practised as a hanif and never worshipped idols.\n\n\n== Acceptance of Islam ==\nOn his return from a business trip in Yemen, friends informed him that in his absence, Muhammad had declared himself the Messenger of God and proclaimed a new religion. The historian Al-Tabari, in his Ta'rikh al-Tabari, quotes from Muhammad ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, who said: \n\nI asked my father whether Abu Bakr was the first of the Muslims. He said, 'No, more than fifty people embraced Islam before Abu Bakr; but he was superior to us as a Muslim. And Umar ibn Khattab had embraced Islam after forty-five men and twenty-one women. As for the foremost one in the matter of Islam and faith, it was Ali ibn Abi Talib.'\nOther Sunni and all Shi'a Muslims maintain that the second person to publicly accept Muhammed as the Messenger of God was Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first being Muhammad's wife Khadija. Ibn Kathir, in his Al Bidaya Wal Nihayah, disregards this. He stated that the first woman to embrace Islam was Khadijah. Zayd ibn Harithah was the first freed slave to embrace Islam. Ali ibn Abi Talib was the first child to embrace Islam, for he has not even reached the age of puberty at that time, while Abu Bakr was the first free man to embrace Islam.\n\n\n=== Subsequent life in Mecca ===\nHis wife Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza did not accept Islam and he divorced her. His other wife, Um Ruman, became a Muslim. All his children accepted Islam except Abdul-Rahman, from whom Abu Bakr disassociated himself. His conversion also brought many people to Islam. He persuaded his intimate friends to convert, and presented Islam to other friends in such a way that many of them also accepted the faith. Those who converted to Islam at the insistence of Abu Bakr were:\nUthman Ibn Affan (who would become the 3rd Caliph)\nAl-Zubayr (who played a part in the Muslim conquest of Egypt)\nTalha Ibn Ubayd-Allah\nAbdur Rahman bin Awf (who would remain an important part of the Rashidun Caliphate)\nSa`d ibn Abi Waqqas (who played a part in the Islamic conquest of Persia)\nAbu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah (who remained commander in chief of the Rashidun army in Syria )\nAbu Salama (Abdullah bin Abdul Asad)\nKhalid ibn Sa`id\nAbu Hudhaifah ibn al-MughirahAbu Bakr's acceptance proved to be a milestone in Muhammad's mission. Slavery was common in Mecca, and many slaves accepted Islam. When an ordinary free man accepted Islam, despite opposition, he would enjoy the protection of his tribe. For slaves, however, there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution. Abu Bakr felt compassion for slaves, so he purchased eight (four men and four women) and then freed them, paying 40,000 dinar for their freedom.The men were\n\nBilal ibn Ribah\nAbu Fakih\nAmmar ibn Yasir\nAbu FuhayraThe women were:\n\nLubaynah\nAl-Nahdiah\nUmm Ubays\nHarithah bint al-MuammilMost of the slaves liberated by Abu Bakr were either women or old and frail men. When the father of Abu Bakr asked him why he didn't liberate strong and young slaves, who could be a source of strength for him, Abu Bakr replied that he was freeing the slaves for the sake of God, and not for his own sake.\n\n\n=== Persecution by the Quraysh, 613 ===\n\nFor three years after the birth of Islam, Muslims kept their faith secret. In 613, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was commanded by God to call people to Islam openly. The first public address inviting people to offer allegiance to Muhammad was delivered by Abu Bakr. In a fit of fury, the young men of the Quraysh tribe rushed at Abu Bakr and beat him till he lost consciousness. Following this incident, Abu Bakr's mother converted to Islam. Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh. Though Abu Bakr's beliefs would have been defended by his own clan, it would not be so for the entire Quraysh tribe.\n\n\n=== Last years in Mecca ===\nIn 617, the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the Banu Hashim. Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim, were cut off in a pass away from Mecca. All social relations with the Banu Hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment. Before it many Muslims migrated to Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Abu Bakr, feeling distressed, set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there. He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna (chief of the Qarah tribe) outside Mecca, who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh. Abu Bakr went back to Mecca, it was a relief for him, but soon due to the pressure of Quraysh, Ad-Dughna was forced to renounce his protection. Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr.\nIn 620, Muhammad's uncle and protector, Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib, and Muhammad's wife Khadija died. Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha was engaged to Muhammad, however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later. In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammad's Isra and Mi'raj (Night Journey).\n\n\n== Migration to Medina ==\n\nIn 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of Medina, Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina. The migration began in batches. Ali was the last to remain in Mecca, entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the Muslims had taken out, and famously slept in the bed of Muhammad when the Quraysh, led by Ikrima, attempted to murder Muhammad as he slept. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad to Medina. Due to the danger posed by the Quraysh, they did not take the road, but moved in the opposite direction, taking refuge in a cave in Jabal Thawr, some five miles south of Mecca. `Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, the son of Abu Bakr, would listen to the plans and discussions of the Quraysh, and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave. Asma bint Abi Bakr, the daughter of Abu Bakr, brought them meals every day. Aamir, a servant of Abu Bakr, would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night, where they were milked. The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions. One party came close to the entrance to the cave, but was unable to see them. Due to this, Qur'an verse 9:40 was revealed. Aisha, Abu Sa\u2018id al-Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas in interpreting this verse said that Abu Bakr was the companion who stayed with Muhammad in the cave.\nAfter staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to Medina, staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina.\n\n\n=== Life in Medina ===\nIn Medina, Muhammad decided to construct a mosque. A piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by Abu Bakr. The Muslims, including Abu Bakr, constructed a mosque named Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at the site. Abu Bakr was paired with Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari (who was from Medina) as a brother in faith. Abu Bakr's relationship with Khaarijah was most cordial, which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba, a daughter of Khaarijah. Khaarijah bin Zaid Ansari lived at Sunh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there. After Abu Bakr's family arrived in Medina, he bought another house near Muhammad's.While the climate of Mecca was dry, the climate of Medina was damp and because of this, most of the migrants fell sick on arrival. Abu Bakr contracted a fever for several days, during which time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. In Mecca, Abu Bakr was a wholesale trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He opened his new store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished. Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, further strengthening relations between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.\n\n\n== Military campaigns under Muhammad ==\n\n\n=== Battle of Badr ===\n\nIn 624, Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the Battle of Badr, but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent. In relation to this, Ali allegedly later asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men. Everyone stated that Ali was the bravest of all men. Ali then replied:\n\nNo. Abu Bakr is the bravest of men. In the Battle of Badr we had prepared a pavillion for the prophet, but when we were asked to offer ourselves for the task of guarding it none came forward except Abu Bakr. With a drawn sword he took his stand by the side of Prophet of Allah and guarded him from the infidels by attacking those who dared to proceed in that direction. He was therefore the bravest of men.\nIn Sunni accounts, during one such attack, two discs from Abu Bakr's shield penetrated into Muhammad's cheeks. Abu Bakr went forward with the intention of extracting these discs but Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah requested he leave the matter to him, losing his two incisors during the process. In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr, along with other companions, led Muhammad to a place of safety.\n\n\n=== Battle of Uhud ===\n\nIn 625, he participated in the Battle of Uhud, in which the majority of the Muslims were routed and he himself was wounded. Before the battle had begun, his son Abdul-Rahman, at that time still non-Muslim and fighting on the side of the Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad. Later, Abdul-Rahman approached his father and said to him \"You were exposed to me as a target, but I turned away from you and did not kill you.\" To this Abu Bakr replied \"However, if you had been exposed to me as a target I would not have turned away from you.\"\nIn the second phase of the battle, Khalid ibn al-Walid\u2019s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, changing a Muslim victory to defeat. Many fled from the battlefield, including Abu Bakr. However, according to his own account, he was \"the first to return\".\n\n\n=== Battle of the Trench ===\n\nIn 627 he participated in the Battle of the Trench and also in the Invasion of Banu Qurayza. In the Battle of the Trench, Muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector. One of these contingents was under the command of Abu Bakr. The enemy made frequent assaults in an attempt to cross the ditch, all of which were repulsed. To commemorate this event a mosque, later known as 'Masjid-i-Siddiq', was constructed at the site where Abu Bakr had repulsed the charges of the enemy.\n\n\n=== Battle of Khaybar ===\n\nAbu Bakr took part in the Battle of Khaybar. Khaybar had eight fortresses, the strongest and most well-guarded of which was called Al-Qamus. Muhammad sent Abu Bakr with a group of warriors to attempt to take it, but they were unable to do so. Muhammad also sent Umar with a group of warriors, but Umar could not conquer Al-Qamus either. Some other Muslims also attempted to capture the fort, but they were unsuccessful as well. Finally, Muhammad sent Ali, who defeated the enemy leader, Marhab.\n\n\n=== Military campaigns during final years of Muhammad ===\n\nIn 629 Muhammad sent 'Amr ibn al-'As to Zaat-ul-Sallasal, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah in response to a call for reinforcements. Abu Bakr and Umar commanded an army under al-Jarrah, and they attacked and defeated the enemy.In 630, when the Muslims conquered Mecca, Abu Bakr was part of the army. Before the conquest of Mecca his father Uthman Abu Quhafa converted to Islam.\n\n\n==== Battles of Hunayn and Ta'if ====\n\nIn 630, the Muslim army was ambushed by archers from the local tribes as it passed through the valley of Hunayn, some eleven miles northeast of Mecca. Taken unaware, the advance guard of the Muslim army fled in panic. There was considerable confusion, and the camels, horses and men ran into one another in an attempt to seek cover. Muhammad, however, stood firm. Only nine companions remained around him, including Abu Bakr. Under Muhammad's instruction, Abbas shouted at the top of his voice, \"O Muslims, come to the Prophet of Allah\". The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad. When the Muslims had gathered in sufficient number, Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy. In the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to Autas.\nMuhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas. In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught. Believing continued resistance useless, the tribes broke camp and retired to Ta'if.\nAbu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the attack against Ta'if. The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open. The Muslims employed catapults, but without tangible result. The Muslims attempted to use a testudo formation, in which a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate. However, the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo, rendering it ineffective.\nThe siege dragged on for two weeks, and still there was no sign of weakness in the fort. Muhammad held a council of war. Abu Bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that God make arrangements for the fall of the fort. The advice was accepted, and in February 630, the siege of Ta'if was raised and the Muslim army returned to Mecca. A few days later Malik bin Auf, the commander, came to Mecca and became a Muslim.\n\n\n=== Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj ===\nIn 631 AD, Muhammad sent from Medina a delegation of three hundred Muslims to perform the Hajj according to the new Islamic way and appointed Abu Bakr as the leader of the delegation. The day after Abu Bakr and his party had left for the Hajj, Muhammad received a new revelation: Surah Tawbah, the ninth chapter of the Qur'an. It is related that when this revelation came, someone suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr. Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation.Muhammad summoned Ali, and asked him to proclaim a portion of Surah Tawbah to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at Mina. Ali went forth on Muhammad's slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr. When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them. Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad.\nAt Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad. The main points of the proclamation were:\n\nHenceforward the non-Muslims were not to be allowed to visit the Kaaba or perform the pilgrimage.\nNo one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked.\nPolytheism was not to be tolerated. Where the Muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods. Where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists.From the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned, and Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia.\n\n\n=== Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq ===\n\nAbu Bakr led one military expedition, the Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, which took place in Nejd, in July 628 (third month 7AH in the Islamic calendar).  Abu Bakr led a large company in Nejd on the order of Muhammad.  Many were killed and taken prisoner. The Sunni Hadith collection Sunan Abu Dawud mentions the event.\n\n\n=== Expedition of Usama bin Zayd ===\n\nIn 632, during the final weeks of his life, Muhammad ordered an expedition into Syria to avenge the defeat of the Muslims in the Battle of Mu'tah some years previously. Leading the campaign was Usama ibn Zayd, whose father, Muhammad's erstwhile adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah, had been killed in the earlier conflict. No more than twenty years old, inexperienced and untested, Usama's appointment was controversial, becoming especially problematic when veterans such as Abu Bakr, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas were placed under his command. Nevertheless, the expedition was dispatched, though soon after setting off, news was received of Muhammad's death, forcing the army to return to Medina. The campaign was not reengaged until after Abu Bakr's ascension to the caliphate, at which point he chose to reaffirm Usama's command, which ultimately led to its success.\n\n\n== Death of Muhammad ==\nThere are a number of traditions regarding Muhammad's final days which have been used to reinforce the idea of the great friendship and trust which is said to have existed between him and Abu Bakr. In one such episode, as Muhammad was nearing death, he found himself unable to lead prayers as he usually would. He instructed Abu Bakr to take his place, ignoring concerns from Aisha that her father was too emotionally delicate for the role. Abu Bakr subsequently took up the position, and when Muhammad entered the prayer hall one morning during Fajr prayers, Abu Bakr attempted to step back to let him to take up his normal place and lead. Muhammad however, allowed him to continue. In a related incident, around this time, Muhammad ascended the pulpit and addressed the congregation, saying \"God has given his servant the choice between this world and that which is with God and he has chosen the latter.\" Abu Bakr, understanding this to mean that Muhammad did not have long to live, responded \"Nay, we and our children will be your ransom.\" Muhammad consoled his friend and ordered that all the doors leading to the mosque be closed aside from that which led from Abu Bakr's house, \"for I know no one who is a better friend to me than he.\"Upon Muhammad's death, the Muslim community was unprepared for the loss of its leader and many experienced a profound shock. Umar was particularly effected, instead declaring that Muhammad had gone to consult with God and would soon return, threatening anyone who would say that Muhammad was dead. Abu Bakr, having returned to Medina, calmed Umar by showing him Muhammad's body, convincing him of his death. He then addressed those who had gathered at the mosque, saying \"If anyone worships Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. If anyone worships God, God is alive, immortal\", thus putting an end to any idolising impulse in the population. He then concluded with a verse from the Quran: \"Muhammad is no more than an apostle, and many apostles have passed away before him.\"[Quran 3:144]\n\n\n== Saqifa ==\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the death of Muhammad, a gathering of the Ansar (natives of Medina) took place in the Saqifah (courtyard) of the Banu Sa'ida clan. The general belief at the time was that the purpose of the meeting was for the Ansar to decide on a new leader of the Muslim community among themselves, with the intentional exclusion of the Muhajirun (migrants from Mecca), though this has later become the subject of debate.Nevertheless, Abu Bakr and Umar, upon learning of the meeting, became concerned of a potential coup and hastened to the gathering. Upon arriving, Abu Bakr addressed the assembled men with a warning that an attempt to elect a leader outside of Muhammad's own tribe, the Quraysh, would likely result in dissension, as only they can command the necessary respect among the community. He then took Umar and another companion, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, by the hand and offered them to the Ansar as potential choices. Habab ibn Mundhir, a veteran from the Battle of Badr, countered with his own suggestion that the Quraysh and the Ansar choose a leader each from among themselves, who would then rule jointly. The group grew heated upon hearing this proposal and began to argue amongst themselves. The orientalist William Muir gives the following observation of the situation:\nThe moment was critical. The unity of the Faith was at stake. A divided power would fall to pieces, and all might be lost. The mantle of the Prophet must fall upon one Successor, and on one alone. The sovereignty of Islam demanded an undivided Caliphate; and Arabia would acknowledge no master but from amongst Koreish.\nUmar hastily took Abu Bakr's hand and swore his own allegiance to the latter, an example followed by the gathered men. The meeting broke up when a violent scuffle erupted between Umar and the chief of the Banu Sa'ida, Sa'd ibn Ubadah. This may indicate that the choice of Abu Bakr may not have been unanimous, with emotions running high as a result of the disagreement.Abu Bakr was near-universally accepted as head of the Muslim community (under the title of Caliph) as a result of Saqifah, though he did face contention because of the rushed nature of the event. Several companions, most prominent among them being Ali ibn Abi Talib, initially refused to acknowledge his authority. Among Shi'ites, it is also argued that Ali had previously been appointed as Muhammad's heir, with the election being seen as in contravention to the latter's wishes. Abu Bakr later sent Umar to confront Ali, resulting in an altercation which may have involved violence. However, after six months the group made peace with Abu Bakr and Ali offered him his allegiance.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nAfter assuming the office of Caliph, Abu Bakr's first address was as follows:\n\nI have been given the authority over you, and I am not the best of you. If I do well, help me; and if I do wrong, set me right. Sincere regard for truth is loyalty and disregard for truth is treachery. The weak amongst you shall be strong with me until I have secured his rights, if God wills; and the strong amongst you shall be weak with me until I have wrested from him the rights of others, if God wills. Obey me so long as I obey God and His Messenger. But if I disobey God and His Messenger, you owe me no obedience. Arise for your prayer, God have mercy upon you. (Al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 6:305, 306)\nAbu Bakr's reign lasted for 27 months, during which he crushed the rebellion of the Arab tribes throughout the Arabian Peninsula in the successful Ridda Wars. In the last months of his rule, he sent Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests against the Sassanid Empire in Mesopotamia and against the Byzantine Empire in Syria. This would set in motion a historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman ibn Affan) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, he agreed to draw a salary from the state treasury and discontinue his cloth trade.\n\n\n=== Ridda wars ===\n\nTroubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, with several Arab tribes launching revolts, threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state. These insurgencies and the caliphate's responses to them are collectively referred to  as the Ridda wars (\"Wars of Apostasy\").The opposition movements came in two forms. One type challenged the political power of the nascent caliphate as well as the religious authority of Islam with the acclamation of rival ideologies, headed by political leaders who claimed the mantle of prophethood in the manner that Muhammad had done. These rebellions include:\nthat of the Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah headed by Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid\nthat of the Banu Hanifa headed by Musaylimah\nthose from among the Banu Taghlib and the Bani Tamim headed by Sajah\nthat of the Al-Ansi headed by Al-Aswad Al-AnsiThese leaders are all denounced in Islamic histories as \"false prophets\".The second form of opposition movement was more strictly political in character. Some of the revolts of this type took the form of tax rebellions in Najd among tribes such as the Banu Fazara and Banu Tamim. Other dissenters, while initially allied to the Muslims, used Muhammad's death as an opportunity to attempt to restrict the growth of the new Islamic state. They include some of the Rab\u012b\u02bfa in Bahrayn, the Azd in Oman, as well as among the Kindah and Khawlan in Yemen.Abu Bakr, likely understanding that maintaining firm control over the disparate tribes of Arabia was crucial to ensuring the survival of the state, suppressed the insurrections with military force. He dispatched Khalid ibn Walid and a body of troops to subdue the uprisings in Najd as well as that of Musaylimah, who posed the most serious threat. Concurrent to this, Shurahbil ibn Hasana and Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami were sent to Bahrayn, while Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl, Hudhayfah al-Bariqi and Arfaja al-Bariqi were instructed to conquer Oman. Finally, Al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya and Khalid ibn Asid were sent to Yemen to aid the local governor in re-establishing control. Abu Bakr also made use of diplomatic means in addition to military measures. Like Muhammad before him, he utilised marriage alliances and financial incentives to bind former enemies to the caliphate. For instance, a member of the Banu Hanifa who had sided with the Muslims was rewarded with the granting of a land estate. Similarly, a Kindah rebel named Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, after repenting and re-joining Islam, was later given land in Medina as well as the hand of Abu Bakr's sister Umm Farwa in marriage.At their heart, the Ridda movements were challenges to the political and religious supremacy of the Islamic state. Through his success in suppressing the insurrections, Abu Bakr had in effect continued the political consolidation which had begun under Muhammad's leadership with relatively little interruption. By wars' end, he had established an Islamic hegemony over the entirety of the Arabian peninsula.\n\n\n=== Expeditions into Persia and Syria ===\nWith Arabia having united under a single centralised state with a formidable military, the region could now be viewed as a potential threat to the neighbouring Byzantine and Sasanian empires. It may be that Abu Bakr, reasoning that it was inevitable that one of these powers would launch a pre-emptive strike against the youthful caliphate, decided that it was better to deliver the first blow himself. Regardless of the caliph's motivations, in 633, small forces were dispatched into Iraq and Palestine, capturing several towns. Though the Byzantines and Sassanians were certain to retaliate, Abu Bakr had reason to be confident; the two empires were militarily exhausted after centuries of war against each other, making it likely that any forces sent to Arabia would be diminished and weakened.A more pressing advantage though was the effectiveness of the Muslim fighters as well as their zeal, the latter of which was partially based on their certainty of the righteousness of their cause. Additionally, the general belief among the Muslims was that the community must be defended at all costs. Historian Theodor N\u00f6ldeke gives the somewhat controversial opinion that this religious fervour was intentionally used to maintain the enthusiasm and momentum of the ummah:\nIt was certainly good policy to turn the recently subdued tribes of the wilderness towards an external aim in which they might at once satisfy their lust for booty on a grand scale, maintain their warlike feeling, and strengthen themselves in their attachment to the new faith\u2026 Muhammad himself had already sent expeditions across the [Byzantine] frontier, and thereby had pointed out the way to his successors. To follow in his footsteps was in accordance with the innermost being of the youthful Islam, already grown great amid the tumult of arms.\nThough Abu Bakr had started these initial conflicts which eventually resulted in the Islamic conquests of Persia and the Levant, he did not live to see any real fighting, instead leaving the task to his successors.\n\n\n=== Preservation of the Quran ===\n\nAbu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the Quran in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama in 632, Umar saw that some five hundred of the Muslims who had memorised the Quran had been killed. Fearing that it may become lost or corrupted, Umar requested that Abu Bakr authorise the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. The caliph was initially hesitant, being quoted as saying  \"how can we do that which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless and keep him, did not himself do?\" He eventually relented however, and appointed Zayd ibn Thabit, who had previously served as Muhammad's secretary, for the task of gathering the scattered verses. The fragments were recovered from every quarter, including from the ribs of palm branches, scraps of leather, stone tablets and \"from the hearts of men\". The collected work was transcribed onto sheets and verified through comparison with Quran memorisers. The finished codex, termed the Mus'haf, was presented to Abu Bakr, who prior to his death, bequeathed it to his successor Umar. Upon Umar's own death, the Mus'haf was left to his daughter Hafsa, who had been one of the wives of Muhammad. It was this volume, borrowed from Hafsa, which formed the basis of Uthman's legendary prototype, which became the definitive text of the Quran. All later editions are derived from this original.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn 23 August 634, Abu Bakr fell sick and did not recover. He developed a high fever and was confined to bed. His illness was prolonged, and when his condition worsened, he felt that his end was near. Realising this, he sent for Ali and requested him to perform his ghusl since Ali had also done it for Muhammad.\nAbu Bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the Muslims after his death, though there was already controversy over Ali not having been appointed. He appointed Umar for this role after discussing the matter with some companions. Some of them favoured the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar.\nAbu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to Uthman ibn Affan as follows:\n\nIn the name of Most Merciful God. This is the last will and testament of Abu Bakr bin Abu Quhafa, when he is in the last hour of the world, and the first of the next; an hour in which the infidel must believe, the wicked be convinced of their evil ways, I nominate Umar bin al Khattab as my successor. Therefore, hear to him and obey him. If he acts right, confirm his actions. My intentions are good, but I cannot see the future results. However, those who do ill shall render themselves liable to severe account hereafter. Fare you well. May you be ever attended by the Divine favor of blessing.\nUmar led the funeral prayer for him and he was buried beside the grave of Muhammad.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe historian Al-Tabari, in regards to Abu Bakr's appearance, records the following interaction between Aisha and her paternal nephew, Abdullah ibn Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr:\n\nWhen she was in her howdah and saw a man from among the Arabs passing by, she said, \"I have not seen a man more like Abu Bakr than this one.\" We said to her, \"Describe Abu Bakr.\" She said, \"A slight, white man, thin-bearded and bowed. His waist wrapper would not hold but would fall down around his loins. He had a lean face, sunken eyes, a bulging forehead, and trembling knuckles.\"\n\nReferencing another source, Al-Tabari further describes him as being \"white mixed with yellowness, of good build, slight, \nbowed, thin, tall like a male palm tree, hook-nosed, lean-faced, sunken-eyed, thin-shanked, and strong-thighed. He used to dye himself with henna and black dye.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThough the period of his caliphate covers only two years, two months and fifteen days, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time: the Sassanid Empire and Byzantine Empire.\nAbu Bakr had the distinction of being the first Caliph in the history of Islam and also the first Caliph to nominate a successor. He was the only Caliph in the history of Islam who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate.He has the distinction of purchasing the land for Al-Masjid al-Nabawi.\n\n\n=== Sunni view ===\nSunni Muslims believe that Abu Bakr is the best man of all the human beings after the prophets. They also consider Abu Bakr as one of The Ten Promised Paradise (al-\u2018Ashara al-Mubashshara) whom Muhammad had testified were destined for Paradise. He is regarded as the \"Successor of Allah's Messenger\" (Khalifa Rasulullah), and first of the Rightly Guided Caliphs \u2013 i.e. Rashidun\u2014and as the rightful successor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life, being beside Muhammad at every major event. It was Abu Bakr's wisdom that Muhammad always honored. Abu Bakr is regarded among the best of Muhammad's followers; as Umar ibn Khattab stated, \"If the faith of Abu Bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth, the faith of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others.\"\n\n\n=== Shia view ===\n\nThe Twelver Shia (as the main branch of Shia Islam, with 85% of all Shias) believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib was supposed to assume the Caliphate, and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by Muhammad as his successor at Ghadir Khumm. It is also believed that Abu Bakr and Umar conspired to take over power in the Muslim nation after Muhammad's death, in a coup d'\u00e9tat against Ali. The Twelver Shi'a do not believe that Abu Bakr's being with Muhammad in the cave when the two fled Mecca was a meritorious act, and, indeed, find significant criticism of Abu Bakr in the Qur'anic verse of the cave.\nMost Twelver Shia criticize Abu Bakr because, after Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr refused to grant Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah, the lands of the village of Fadak which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death. He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims, Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well. In addition, Shias claim that Muhammad had given Fadak to Fatimah during his lifetime, and Fadak was therefore a gift to Fatimah, not inheritance. This view has also been supported some Sunnis, such as the Abbasid ruler Al-Ma'mun.The Twelver Shia accuse him of participating in the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima.The Twelver Shia believe that Abu Bakr sent Khalid ibn Walid to crush those who were in favour of Ali's caliphate (see Ridda Wars). The Twelver Shia strongly refute the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the Qur'an, claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of Ali.After the death of Abu Bakr, Ali raised Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. The Twelver Shia view Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as one of the companions of Ali. When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Ummayads, Aisha, the wife of Muhammad and also a renowned scholar of her time, raised and taught her nephew Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's daughter Farwah bint al-Qasim was married to Muhammad al-Baqir and was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grandson of Abu Bakr and the grandfather of Jafar al-Sadiq. Zaydis, the largest group amongst the Shia before the Safavid Dynasty and currently the second-largest group (although its population is only about 5% of all Shia Muslims), believe that on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali (the uncle of Jafar al-Sadiq), he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: \"May God have mercy on you! What do you have to say on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?\" Zayd ibn Ali said, \"I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBodla\nLaqit bin Malik Al-Azdi, opponent\nList of Sahaba\nSunni view of the Sahaba\nMuadh ibn Jabal\nSermon of Fadak\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHuthayfa, Abu (2013), Abu Bakr: The First Caliph, ISBN 9780958172035\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuslim:\nQuilliamPress.com: Abu Bakr\nAbuBakr.com\nVirtues of Hazrat Abu Bakr\nDetailed Life of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq\nAbu Bakr's life\nNaqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order biography of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq\nGreatness of Abu Bakr\nBiography of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq by Adam Walker [2]Urdu Audio\n\nVirtues of Abu Bakr Urdu Audio\nAbu Bakr appearing in Narrations/Hadith recorded by Imam Bukhari \u2013 www.SearchTruth.com\nAbu bakr's appointment as Khalifah\nSearchable Family tree of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq by Happy Books\nNon-Muslim:\nAbu Bakr\nUnclassified:\nAbu Bakr\nAbu Bakr from Islamonline\nSirah of Abu Bakr (Radia'Allahuanhu) Part 1 by Shaykh Sayyed Muhammad bin Yahya Al-Husayni Al-Ninowy.\nShia:\nIncident of the cave\nAbu Bakr",

        "wiki": "Mecca, officially Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: \u0645\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0629\u200e, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Noble') and commonly shortened to Makkah, is the holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. The city is located 70 km (43 mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was 1,578,722 in 2015. estimated metro population in 2020 is 2.042 million, making it the third-most populated city in the kingdom. Pilgrims more than triple this number every year during the \u1e24ajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dh\u016bl-\u1e24ijjah.\nMecca is the birthplace of Muhammad. The Hira cave located atop the Jabal al-Nur (\"Mountain of Light\") is located just outside the city and is the location where Muslims believe the Qur'an was first revealed to Muhammad. Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla), cementing Mecca's significance in Islam.Muslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, the city has seen several regime changes, which owes to its rich history. The city was finally conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by Ibn Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait, the world's fourth-tallest building and third-largest by floor area, towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has also carried out a destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites, such as the Ajyad Fortress. Non-Muslims (Kuffar) are strictly prohibited from entering the city.Muslims from around the world visit the city, not only for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, but also as tourists to visit regional landmarks such as the 'Aisha Mosque (Masjid 'Aisha) and the sites visited by pilgrims in the Hajj and 'Umrah. Mecca is now home to two of the most expensive buildings in the world, the Masjid al-Haram, valued at 100 billion US dollars, and the Abraj al-Bait complex, valued at 15 billion US dollars.\nUnder the Saudi government, Mecca is governed by the Makkah Regional Municipality, a municipal council of 14 locally elected members headed by the mayor (called Amin in Arabic) appointed by the Saudi government. As of May 2015, the mayor of the city is Dr. Osama bin Fadhel Al-Barr. The City of Mecca amanah, which constitutes Mecca and the surrounding region, is the capital of the Makkah Province, which includes the neighboring cities of Jeddah and Ta'if, even though Jeddah is considerably larger in population compared to Mecca. The Provincial Governor of the province from 16 May 2007 is Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud was appointed as the new governor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nMecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, the etymology of Makkah is obscure. Widely believed to be a synonym for Mecca, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah.Bakkah\n\nThe Qur'an refers to the city as Bakkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96, \"Indeed the first House [of worship], established for mankind was that at Bakkah...\"\n\u2013 Qur'an 3:96 This is presumed to have been the name of the city at the time of Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition) and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca, Bekka, among others.Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca\nIn South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, the b and m were interchangeable. This is presumed to have been the origin of the current form of the name. \"Makkah\" is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation. The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but is not universally known or used worldwide. The full official name is Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: \u0645\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0629\u200e, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Honored'). \"Makkah\" is used to refer to the city in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.The word \"Mecca\" in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large numbers of people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this spelling for the city as offensive.  Mecca is the familiar form of the English transliteration for the Arabic name of the city,\nThe consensus in academic scholarship is that \"Macoraba\", the place mentioned in Arabia Felix by Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca. Many etymologies have been proposed but the most suitable one is that it is derived from the Old South Arabian root \"M-K-R-B\" which means temple.Other names\nAnother name used for Mecca in the Qur'an is at 6:92 where it is called Umm al-Qur\u0101 (\u0623\u064f\u0645\u0651 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0649, meaning \"Mother of all Settlements\". The city has been called several other names in both the Qur'an and ahadith. Another name used historically for Mecca is Tih\u0101mah. According to Arab and Islamic tradition, another name for Mecca, F\u0101r\u0101n, is synonymous with the Desert of Paran mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21:21. Arab and Islamic tradition holds that the wilderness of Paran, broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca. Yaqut al-Hamawi, the 12th century Syrian geographer, wrote that F\u0101r\u0101n was \"an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned in the Torah.\"\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nIn 2010, Mecca and the surrounding area became an important site for paleontology with respect to primate evolution, with the discovery of a Saadanius fossil. Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the Old World monkeys and apes. The fossil habitat, near what is now the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia, was a damp forest area between 28 million and 29 million years ago. Paleontologists involved in the research hope to find further fossils in the area.\n\n\n=== Early history (upto 5th century CE) ===\n\nThe early history of Mecca is still largely disputed, as there are no unambiguous reference to it in ancient literature prior to the rise of Islam and no architecture from the time of Muhammad. The Roman Empire took control of part of the Hejaz in 106 CE, ruling cities such as Hegra (now known as Mada'in Saleh), located around 800 km (500 mi) north of Mecca. Even though detailed descriptions of Western Arabia were established by the Romans, such as by Procopius, there are no references of a pilgrimage and trading outpost such as Mecca.Potential ancient references\nThe Greek historian Diodorus Siculus writes about Arabia in his work Bibliotheca historica, describing a holy shrine: \"And a temple has been set up there, which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians\". Claims have been made this could be a reference to the Ka'bah in Mecca. However, the geographic location Diodorus describes is located in northwest Arabia, around the area of Leuke Kome, closer to Petra and within the former Nabataean Kingdom and Roman province of Arabia Petraea.Ptolemy lists the names of 50 cities in Arabia, one going by the name of \"Macoraba\". There has been speculation since 1646 that this could be a reference to Mecca, but many scholars see no compelling explanation to link the two names. Bowersock favors the identity of the former, with his theory being that \"Macoraba\" is the word \"Makkah\" followed by the aggrandizing Aramaic adjective rabb (great). The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus also enumerated many cities of Western Arabia, most of whom can be identified. According to Bowersock, he did mention Mecca as \"Geapolis\" or \"Hierapolis\", the latter one meaning \"holy city\", referring to the sanctuary of the Ka'bah, well known already in pagan times. Patricia Crone, from the Revisionist school of Islamic studies on the other hand, writes that \"the plain truth is that the name Macoraba has nothing to do with that of Mecca [...] if Ptolemy mentions Mecca at all, he calls it Moka, a town in Arabia Petraea\" (in northwest Arabia near present-day Petra).\nThe first direct reference to Mecca in external literature occurs in 741 CE, in the Byzantine-Arab Chronicle, though here the author places it in Mesopotamia rather than the Hejaz. Given the inhospitable environment, and lack of historical references in Roman, Persian and Indian sources, historians including Patricia Crone and Tom Holland have cast doubt on the claim that Mecca was a major historical trading outpost. However, other scholars such as Glen W. Bowersock disagree and assert that Mecca was a major trading outpost.Mecca is mentioned in the following early Qur'anic manuscripts:\n\nCodex Is. 1615 I, folio 47v, radiocarbon dated to 591-643 CE.\nCodex \u1e62an\u02bf\u0101\u02be DAM 01\u201329.1, folio 29a, radiocarbon dated between 633-665 CE.\nCodex Arabe 331, folio 40 v, radiocarbon dated between 652-765 CE.Islamic narrative\nIn the Islamic view, the beginnings of Mecca are attributed to the Biblical figures, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael. The civilization of Mecca is believed to have started after Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (Abraham) left his son Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl (Ishmael) and wife H\u0101jar (Hagar) in the valley at Allah's command. Some people from the Yemeni tribe of Jurhum settled with them, and Isma'il reportedly married two women, one after divorcing the first, on Ibrahim's advice. At least one man of the Jurhum helped Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl and his father to construct or according to Islamic narratives, reconstruct, the Ka'bah ('Cube'), which would have social, religious, political and historical implications for the site and region.Muslims see the mention of a pilgrimage at the Valley of Baca in the Old Testament chapter Psalm 84:3\u20136 as a reference to Mecca, similar to the Qur'an at Surah 3:96. In the Shar\u1e25 al-As\u0101\u1e6d\u012br, a commentary on the Samaritan midrashic chronology of the Patriarchs, of unknown date but probably composed in the 10th century CE, it is claimed that Mecca was built by the sons of Nebaioth, the eldest son of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl or Ishmael.Thamudic inscriptions\nSome Thamudic inscriptions which were discovered in the south Jordan contained names of some individuals such as \u02bfAbd Mekkat (\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0651\u0629, \"Servant of Mecca\").There were also some other inscriptions which contained personal names such as Makki (\u0645\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0651\u064a, \"Meccan\"), but Jawwad Ali from the University of Baghdad suggested that there's also a probability of a tribe named \"Makkah\".\n\n\n=== Under the Quraish ===\nSome time in the 5th century, the Ka'bah was a place of worship for the deities of Arabia's pagan tribes. Mecca's most important pagan deity was Hubal, which had been placed there by the ruling Quraish tribe. and remained until the Conquest of Mecca by Muhammad. In the 5th century, the Quraish took control of Mecca, and became skilled merchants and traders. In the 6th century, they joined the lucrative spice trade, since battles elsewhere were diverting trade routes from dangerous sea routes to more secure overland routes. The Byzantine Empire had previously controlled the Red Sea, but piracy had been increasing. Another previous route that ran through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was also being threatened by exploitations from the Sassanid Empire, and was being disrupted by the Lakhmids, the Ghassanids, and the Roman\u2013Persian Wars. Mecca's prominence as a trading center also surpassed the cities of Petra and Palmyra. The Sassanids however did not always pose a threat to Mecca, as in 575 CE they protected it from a Yemeni invasion, led by its Christian leader Abraha. The tribes of southern Arabia asked the Persian king Khosrau I for aid, in response to which he came south to Arabia with foot-soldiers and a fleet of ships near Mecca.By the middle of the 6th century, there were three major settlements in northern Arabia, all along the south-western coast that borders the Red Sea, in a habitable region between the sea and the Hejaz mountains to the east. Although the area around Mecca was completely barren, it was the wealthiest of the three settlements with abundant water from the renowned Zamzam Well and a position at the crossroads of major caravan routes.The harsh conditions and terrain of the Arabian peninsula meant a near-constant state of conflict between the local tribes, but once a year they would declare a truce and converge upon Mecca in an annual pilgrimage. Up to the 7th century, this journey was intended for religious reasons by the pagan Arabs to pay homage to their shrine, and to drink Zamzam. However, it was also the time each year that disputes would be arbitrated, debts would be resolved, and trading would occur at Meccan fairs. These annual events gave the tribes a sense of common identity and made Mecca an important focus for the peninsula.The Year of the Elephant (570 CE)\nThe \"Year of the Elephant\" is the name in Islamic history for the year approximately equating to 550-552 CE, when, according to Islamic sources such as Ibn Ishaq, Abraha descended upon Mecca, riding an elephant, with a large army after building a cathedral at San'aa, named al-Qullays in honor of the Negus of Axum. It gained widespread fame, even gaining attention from the Byzantine Empire. Abraha attempted to divert the pilgrimage of the Arabs from the Ka'bah to al-Qullays, effectively converting them to Christianity. According to Islamic tradition, this was the year of Muhammad's birth. Abraha allegedly sent a messenger named Muhammad ibn Khuza'i to Mecca and Tihamah with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols. When Muhammad ibn Khuza'i got as far as the land of Kinana, the people of the lowland, knowing what he had come for, sent a man of Hudhayl called \u02bfUrwa bin Hayyad al-Milasi, who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with him, fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and fury and he swore to raid the Kinana tribe and destroy the Ka'bah. Ibn Ishaq further states that one of the men of the Quraysh tribe was angered by this, and going to Sana'a, entering the church at night and defiling it; widely assumed to have done so by defecating in it.\nAbraha marched upon the Ka'bah with a large army, which included one or more war elephants, intending to demolish it. When news of the advance of his army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinanah, Khuza'a and Hudhayl united in the defense of the Ka'bah and the city. A man from the Himyarite Kingdom was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Ka'bah and if they resisted, they would be crushed. Abdul Muttalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he and some members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure he will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\" Abraha eventually attacked Mecca. However, the lead elephant, known as Mahmud, is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca and refused to enter. It has been theorized that an epidemic such as by smallpox could have caused such a failed invasion of Mecca. The reference to the story in Quran is rather short. According to the 115th Surah of the Qur'an, Al-Fil, the next day, a dark cloud of small birds sent by Allah appeared. The birds carried small rocks in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them to a state like that of eaten straw.Economy\nCamel caravans, said to have first been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were a major part of Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods \u2013 leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local mountains \u2013 to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Shaam and Iraq. Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim. Other regional powers such as the Abyssinians, Ghassanids, and Lakhmids were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century.\n\n\n=== Muhammad and the conquest of Mecca ===\nMuhammad was born in Mecca in 570, and thus Islam has been inextricably linked with it ever since. He was born in a minor faction, the Banu Hashim, of the ruling Quraysh tribe. It was in Mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of Hira on Jabal al-Nour, that, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad began receiving divine revelations from God through the archangel Jibreel in 610 AD. Advocating his form of Abrahamic monotheism against Meccan paganism, and after enduring persecution from the pagan tribes for 13 years, Muhammad emigrated to Medina (hijrah) in 622 with his companions, the Muhajirun, to Yathrib (later renamed Madinah). The conflict between the Quraysh and the Muslims is accepted to have begun at this point. Overall, Meccan efforts to annihilate Islam failed and proved to be costly and unsuccessful. During the Battle of the Trench in 627, the combined armies of Arabia were unable to defeat Muhammad's forces.\nIn 628, Muhammad and his followers wanted to enter Mecca for pilgrimage, but were blocked by the Quraysh. Subsequently, Muslims and Meccans entered into the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, whereby the Quraysh and their allies promised to cease fighting Muslims and their allies and promised that Muslims would be allowed into the city to perform the pilgrimage the following year. It was meant to be a ceasefire for 10 years; however, just two years later, the Banu Bakr, allies of the Quraish, violated the truce by slaughtering a group of the Banu Khuza'ah, allies of the Muslims. Muhammad and his companions, now 10,000 strong, marched into Mecca and conquered the city. The pagan imagery was destroyed by Muhammad's followers and the location Islamized and rededicated to the worship of Allah alone. Mecca was declared the holiest site in Islam ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage (Hajj), one of the faith's Five Pillars. Muhammad then returned to Medina, after assigning 'Akib ibn Usaid as governor of the city. His other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula under the banner of Islam. Muhammad died in 632. Within the next few hundred years, stretched from North Africa into Asia and parts of Europe. As the Islamic realm grew, Mecca continued to attract pilgrims from all across the Muslim world and beyond, as Muslims came to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Mecca also attracted a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, pilgrims arrived by boat at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq.\n\n\n=== Medieval and pre-modern times ===\nMecca was never the capital of any of the Islamic states. Muslim rulers did contribute to its upkeep, such as during the reigns of 'Umar (r. 634\u2013644 CE) and 'Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644\u2013656 CE) when concerns of flooding caused the caliphs to bring in Christian engineers to build barrages in the low-lying quarters and construct dykes and embankments to protect the area round the Kaaba.Muhammad's return to Medina shifted the focus away from Mecca and later even further away when 'Ali, the fourth caliph, took power chose Kufa as his capital. The Umayyad Caliphate moved the capital to Damascus in Syria and the Abbasid Caliphate to Baghdad, in modern-day Iraq, which remained the center of the Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history during the Second Fitna, when it was held by Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr and the Zubayrids. The city was twice besieged by the Umayyads, in 683 and 692 and for some time thereafter, the city figured little in politics, remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by various other factions. In 930, Mecca was attacked and sacked by Qarmatians, a millenarian Shi'a Isma'ili Muslim sect led by Ab\u016b-T\u0101hir Al-Jann\u0101b\u012b and centered in eastern Arabia. The Black Death pandemic hit Mecca in 1349.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Ibn Battuta's description of Mecca ====\nOne of the most famous travelers to Mecca in the 14th century was Moroccan scholar and traveler, Ibn Battuta. In his rihla (account), he provides a vast description of the city. Around the year 1327 CE or 729 AH, Ibn Battuta arrived at the holy city. Immediately, he says, it felt like a holy sanctuary and thus. he started the rites of the pilgrimage. He remained in Mecca for three years and left in 1330 CE. During his second year in the holy city, he says his caravan arrived \"with a great quantity of alms for the support of those who were staying in Mecca and Medina\". While in Mecca, prayers were made for (not to) the King of Iraq and also for Salaheddin al-Ayyubi, Sultan of Egypt and Syria at the Ka'bah. Battuta says the Ka'bah was large, but was destroyed and rebuilt smaller than the original and that it contained images of angels and prophets including Jesus, his mother Mary and many others. Battuta describes the Ka'bah as an important part of Mecca due to the fact that many people make the pilgrimage to it. Battuta describes the people of the city as being humble and kind, and also willing to give a part of everything they had to someone who had nothing. The inhabitants of Mecca and the village itself, he says, were very clean. There was also a sense of elegance to the village.Under the Ottomans\nIn 1517, the then Sharif of Mecca, Barakat bin Muhammad, acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Caliph but retained a great degree of local autonomy. In 1803 the city was captured by the First Saudi State, which held Mecca until 1813. destroying some of the historic tombs and domes in and around the city. The Ottomans assigned the task of bringing Mecca back under Ottoman control to their powerful Khedive (viceroy) and Wali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha. Muhammad Ali Pasha successfully returned Mecca to Ottoman control in 1813. In 1818, the Saud were defeated again but survived and founded the Second Saudi State that lasted until 1891 and led on to the present country of Saudi Arabia. In 1853, Sir Richard Francis Burton undertook the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina disguised as a Muslim. Although Burton was certainly not the first non-Muslim European to make the Hajj (Ludovico di Varthema did this in 1503), his pilgrimage remains one of the most famous and documented of modern times. Mecca was regularly hit by cholera outbreaks. Between 1830 and 1930, cholera broke out among pilgrims at Mecca 27 times.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nHashemite Revolt and subsequent control by the Sharifate of Mecca\nIn World War I, the Ottoman Empire was at war with Britain and its allies. It had successfully repulsed an attack on Istanbul in the Gallipoli Campaign and on Baghdad in the Siege of Kut. The British agent T.E. Lawrence conspired with the Ottoman governor, Hussain bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and it was the first city captured by his forces in the 1916 Battle of Mecca. Sharif's revolt proved a turning point of the war on the eastern front. Hussein declared a new state, the Kingdom of Hejaz, declaring himself the Sharif of the state and Mecca his capital. News reports in November 1916 via contact in Cairo with returning Hajj pilgrims, stated that with the Ottoman Turkish authorities gone, the Hajj of 1916 was free of the previous massive extortion and monetary demands made by the Turks who were agents of the Ottoman government.Saudi Arabian conquest and modern history\nFollowing the 1924 Battle of Mecca, the Sharif of Mecca was overthrown by the Saud family, and Mecca was incorporated into Saudi Arabia. Under Saudi rule, much of the historic city has been demolished as a result of the Saudi government fearing these sites might become sites of association in worship beside Allah (shirk). The city has been expanded to include several towns previously considered to be separate from the holy city and now is just a few kilometers outside the main sites of the Hajj, Mina, Muzdalifah and Arafat. Mecca is not served by any airport, due to concerns about the city's safety. It is instead served by the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah (approx. 70 km away) internationally and the Ta'if Regional Airport (approx. 120 km away) for domestic flights.The city today is at the junction of the two most important highways in all of the Saudi Arabian highway system, Highway 40, which connects the city to Jeddah in the west and the capital, Riyadh and Dammam in the east and Highway 15, which connects it to Medina, Tabuk and onward to Jordan in the north and Abha and Jizan in the south. The Ottomans had planned to extend their railway network to the holy city, but were forced to abandon this plan due to their partaking in the First World War. This plan was later carried out by the Saudi government, which connected the two holy cities of Medina and Mecca with the modern Haramain high-speed railway system which runs at 300 km/h (190 mph) and connects the two cities via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh within two hours.The haram area of Mecca, in which the entry of non-Muslims is forbidden, is much larger than that of Medina.\n\n1979 Grand Mosque seizure\nOn 20 November 1979, two hundred armed dissidents led by Juhayman al-Otaibi, seized the Grand Mosque, claiming the Saudi royal family no longer represented pure Islam and that the Masjid al-Haram and the Ka'bah, must be held by those of true faith. The rebels seized tens of thousands of pilgrims as hostages and barricaded themselves in the mosque. The siege lasted two weeks, and resulted in several hundred deaths and significant damage to the shrine, especially the Safa-Marwah gallery. A multinational force was finally able to retake the mosque from the dissidents. Since then, the Grand Mosque has been expanded several times, with many other expansions being undertaken in the present-day.\n\nDestruction of Islamic heritage sites\nUnder Saudi rule, it has been estimated that since 1985, about 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, have been demolished. It has been reported that there are now fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad. Some important buildings that have been destroyed include the house of Khadijah, the wife of Muhammad, the house of Abu Bakr, Muhammad's birthplace and the Ottoman-era Ajyad Fortress. The reason for much of the destruction of historic buildings has been for the construction of hotels, apartments, parking lots, and other infrastructure facilities for Hajj pilgrims.\nIncidents during pilgrimage\nMecca has been the site of several incidents and failures of crowd control because of the large numbers of people who come to make the Hajj. For example, on 2 July 1990, a pilgrimage to Mecca ended in tragedy when the ventilation system failed in a crowded pedestrian tunnel and 1,426 people were either suffocated or trampled to death in a stampede. On 24 September 2015, 700 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at Mina during the stoning-the-Devil ritual at Jamarat.\n\n\n== Significance in Islam ==\n\nMecca holds an important place in Islam and is the holiest city in all branches of the religion. The city derives its importance from the role it plays in the Hajj and 'Umrah.\n\n\n=== Masjid al-Haram ===\nThe Masjid al-Haram is the largest mosque in the world and the most expensive single building in the entire world, valued at 100 billion US dollars, as of 2020. It is the site of two of the most important rites of both the Hajj and of the Umrah, the circumambulation around the Ka'bah (tawaf) and the walking between the two mounts of Safa and Marwa (sa'ee). The masjid is also the site of the Zamzam Well. According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in the masjid is equal to 100,000 prayers in any other masjid around the world.\nKaaba\nThere is a difference of opinion between Islamic scholars upon who first built the Ka'bah, some believe it was built by the angels while others believe it was built by Adam. Regardless, it was built several times before reaching its current state, the most famous of these renovations being the one by Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition). The Ka'bah is also the common direction of prayer (qibla) for all Muslims. The surface surrounding the Ka'bah on which Muslims circumambulate it is known as the Mataf.\nHijr al-Aswad (The Black Stone)\nThe Black Stone is a stone, considered by scientists to be a meteorite or of similar origin and believed by Muslims to be of divine origin. It is set in a corner of the Ka'bah and it is Sunnah to touch and kiss the stone. The area around the stone is generally always crowded and guarded by policemen to ensure the pilgrims' safety.\nMaqam Ibrahim\nThis is a stone which Muslims believe Abraham stood on to build the higher parts of the Ka'bah. It contains two footprints that are comparatively larger than average modern-day human feet. The stone is raised and housed in a golden hexagonal chamber beside the Ka'bah on the Mataf plate.\nSafa and Marwa\n\nMuslims believe that in the divine revelation to Muhammad, the Qur'an, Allah describes the mountains of Safa and Marwah as symbols of his divinity. Walking between the two mountains seven times, 4 times from Safa to Marwah and 3 times from Marwah interchangeably, is considered a mandatory pillar (rukn) of 'Umrah.\n\n\n=== Hajj and 'Umrah ===\nThe Hajj pilgrimage, also called the greater pilgrimage, attracts millions of Muslims from all over the world and almost triples Mecca's population for one week in the twelfth and final Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah. In 2019, the Hajj attracted 2,489,406 pilgrims to the holy city. The 'Umrah, or the lesser pilgrimage, can be done at anytime during the year.  Every adult, healthy Muslim who has the financial and physical capacity to travel to Mecca must perform the Hajj at least once in a lifetime. Umrah, the lesser pilgrimage, is not obligatory, but is recommended in the Quran. In addition to the Masjid al-Haram, pilgrims also must visit the nearby towns of Mina/Muna, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat for various rituals that are part of the Hajj.\n\n\n=== Jabal an-Nur ===\nThis is a mountain believed by Muslims to have been the place where Muhammad spent his time away from the bustling city of Mecca in seclusion. The mountain is located on the eastern entrance of the city and is the highest point in the city at 642 meters (2,106 feet).\n\n\n==== Hira'a Cave ====\nSituated atop Jabal an-Nur, this is the place where Muslims believe Muhammad received the first revelation from Allah through the archangel Gabriel (Jibril in Islamic tradition) at the age of 40.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMecca is located in the Hejaz region, a 200 km (124 mi) wide strip of mountains separating the Nafud desert from the Red Sea. The city is situated in a valley with the same name around 70 km (44 mi) west of the port city of Jeddah. Mecca is one of the lowest cities in elevation in the Hejaz region, located at an elevation of 277 m (909 ft) above sea level at 21\u00ba23' north latitude and 39\u00ba51' east longitude. Mecca is divided into 34 districts.\nThe city centers on the al-Haram area, which contains the Masjid al-Haram. The area around the mosque is the old city and contains the most famous district of Mecca, Ajyad. The main street that runs to al-Haram is the Ibrahim al-Khalil Street, named after Ibrahim. Traditional, historical homes built of local rock, two to three stories long are still present within the city's central area, within view of modern hotels and shopping complexes. The total area of modern Mecca today is over 1,200 km2 (460 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Elevation ===\nMecca is at an elevation of 277 m (909 ft) above sea level, and approximately 70 km (44 mi) inland from the Red Sea. It is one of the lowest in the Hejaz region.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe city center lies in a corridor between mountains, which is often called the \"Hollow of Mecca\". The area contains the valley of al-Taneem, the valley of Bakkah and the valley of Abqar. This mountainous location has defined the contemporary expansion of the city.\n\n\n=== Sources of water ===\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the city used a few chief sources of water. The first were local wells, such as the Zamzam Well, that produced generally brackish water. The second source was the spring of 'Ayn Zubaydah (Spring of Zubaydah). The sources of this spring are the mountains of Jabal Sa'd and Jabal Kabk\u0101b, which are a few kilometers east of 'Arafah/'Arafat or about 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Mecca. Water was transported from it using underground channels. A very sporadic third source was rainfall which was stored by the people in small reservoirs or cisterns. The rainfall, scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since earliest times. According to al-Kurd\u012b, there have been 89 floods by 1965. In the last century, the most severe flood was that of 1942. Since then, dams have been built to ameliorate this problem.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMecca features a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWh), in three different plant hardiness zones: 10, 11 and 12. Like most Saudi Arabian cities, Mecca retains warm to hot temperatures even in winter, which can range from 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) at night to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the afternoon, but also, very rarely, fall to zero and subzero temperatures. Summer temperatures are extremely hot and consistently break the 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) mark in the afternoon, dropping to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the evening, but humidity remains relatively low, at 30\u201340%. Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts scattered between November and January, with heavy thunderstorms also common during the winter.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Meccan economy has been heavily dependent on the annual pilgrimage. Income generated from the Hajj, in fact, not only powers the Meccan economy but has historically had far-reaching effects on the economy of the entire Arabian Peninsula. The income was generated in a number of ways. One method was taxing the pilgrims. Taxes were especially increased during the Great Depression, and many of these taxes existed to as late as 1972. Another way the Hajj generates income is through services to pilgrims. For example, the Saudi flag carrier, Saudia, generates 12% of its income from the pilgrimage. Fares paid by pilgrims to reach Mecca by land also generate income; as do the hotels and lodging companies that house them. The city takes in more than $100 million, while the Saudi government spends about $50 million on services for the Hajj. There are some industries and factories in the city, but Mecca no longer plays a major role in Saudi Arabia's economy, which is mainly based on oil exports. The few industries operating in Mecca include textiles, furniture, and utensils. The majority of the economy is service-oriented.\n\nNevertheless, many industries have been set up in Mecca. Various types of enterprises that have existed since 1970 in the city include corrugated iron manufacturing, copper extraction, carpentry, upholstery, bakeries, farming and banking. The city has grown substantially in the 20th and 21st centuries, as the convenience and affordability of jet travel has increased the number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. Thousands of Saudis are employed year-round to oversee the Hajj and staff the hotels and shops that cater to pilgrims; these workers in turn have increased the demand for housing and services. The city is now ringed by freeways, and contains shopping malls and skyscrapers.\n\n\n== Human resources ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nFormal education started to be developed in the late Ottoman period continuing slowly into Hashemite times. The first major attempt to improve the situation was made by a Jeddah merchant, Muhammad \u02bfAl\u012b Zaynal Ri\u1e0d\u0101, who founded the Madrasat al-Fal\u0101\u1e25 in Mecca in 1911\u201312 that cost \u00a3400,000. The school system in Mecca has many public and private schools for both males and females. As of 2005, there were 532 public and private schools for males and another 681 public and private schools for female students. The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, but some private schools founded by foreign entities such as International schools use the English language for medium of instruction. Some of these are coeducational while other schools are not. For higher education, the city has only one university, Umm Al-Qura University, which was established in 1949 as a college and became a public university in 1979.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nHealthcare is provided by the Saudi government free-of-charge to all pilgrims. There are ten main hospitals in Mecca:\nAjyad Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0623\u064e\u062c\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062f)\nKing Faisal Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643 \u0641\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0644 \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u064a \u0671\u0644\u0634\u0651\u0634\u0647)\nKing Abdulaziz Hospital (Arabic: \u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0632 \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u064a \u0671\u0644\u0640\u0632\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0631\u200e)\nAl Noor Specialist Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0652\u0631 \u0671\u0644\u062a\u064e\u0651\u062e\u064e\u0635\u064f\u0651\u0635\u0650\u064a)\nHira'a Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u062d\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621)\nMaternity and Children's Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0648\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0629 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0637\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0644)\nKing Abdullah Medical City (\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0671\u0644\u0637\u0650\u0651\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629)\nKhulais General Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u062e\u064f\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0635 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0645)\nAl Kamel General Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0644 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0645)\nIbn Sina Hospital (\u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0633\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0621 / \u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0647)There are also many walk-in clinics available for both residents and pilgrims. Several temporary clinics are set up during the Hajj to tend to wounded pilgrims.\n\n\n==== Effect of the CoVID-19 pandemic ====\nIn February 2020, Saudi Arabia temporarily banned foreigners from entering Mecca and Medina to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nMecca's culture has been affected by the large number of pilgrims that arrive annually, and thus boasts a rich cultural heritage. As a result of the vast numbers of pilgrims coming to the city each year, Mecca has become by far the most diverse city in the Muslim world. In contrast to the rest of Saudi Arabia, and particularly Najd, Mecca has, according to The New York Times, become \"a striking oasis of free thought and discussion and, also, of unlikely liberalism as Meccans see themselves as a bulwark against the creeping extremism that has overtaken much Islamic debate\".Al Baik, a local fast-food chain, is very popular among pilgrims and locals alike. Until 2018, it was available only in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah, and traveling to Jeddah just to get a taste of the fried chicken was common.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the most common sports were impromptu wrestling and foot races. Football is now the most popular sport in Mecca and the kingdom, and the city hosts some of the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia such as Al Wahda FC (established in 1945). King Abdulaziz Stadium is the largest stadium in Mecca with a capacity of 38,000.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nMecca is very densely populated. Most long-term residents of Mecca live in the Old City, the area around the Great Mosque and many work to support pilgrims, known locally as the Hajj industry. 'Iyad Madani, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Hajj, was quoted saying, \"We never stop preparing for the Hajj.\"Year-round, pilgrims stream into the city to perform the rites of 'Umrah, and during the last weeks of eleventh Islamic month, Dhu al-Qi'dah, on average 2-4 million Muslims arrive in the city to take part in the rites known as Hajj. Pilgrims are from varying ethnicities and backgrounds, mainly South and Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. Many of these pilgrims have remained and become residents of the city. The Burmese are an older, more established community who number roughly 250,000. Adding to this, the discovery of oil in the past 50 years has brought hundreds of thousands of working immigrants.\nNon-Muslims are not permitted to enter Mecca under Saudi law, and using fraudulent documents to do so may result in arrest and prosecution. The prohibition extends to Ahmadis, as they are considered non-Muslims. Nevertheless, many non-Muslims and Ahmadis have visited the city as these restrictions are loosely enforced. The first such recorded example of a non-Muslim entering the city is that of Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna in 1503. Guru Nanak Sahib, the founder of Sikhism, visited Mecca in December 1518. One of the most famous was Richard Francis Burton, who traveled as a Qadiriyya Sufi from Afghanistan in 1853.\nMecca Province is the only province where expatriates outnumber Saudis.\n\n\n=== Architectural landmarks ===\nAdorning the southern facade of the Masjid al-Haram, the Abraj al-Bait Complex, which towers over the Great Mosque, is a seven-building complex with the central clock tower having a length of 601 m (1,972 feet), making it the world's fourth-tallest building. All seven buildings in the complex also form the third-largest building by floor area. \nThe Mecca Gate, known popularly as the Qur'an Gate, on the western entrance of the city of Mecca, or from Jeddah. Located on Highway 40, it marks the boundary of the Haram area where non-Muslims are prohibited from entering. The gate was designed in 1979 by an Egyptian architect, Samir Elabd, for the architectural firm IDEA Center. The structure is that of a book, representing the Quran, sitting on a rehal, or bookrest.\n\n\n== Communications ==\n\n\n=== Press and newspapers ===\nThe first press was brought to Mecca in 1885 by Osman Nuri Pasha, an Ottoman W\u0101li. During the Hashemite period, it was used to print the city's official gazette, Al Qibla. The Saudi regime expanded this press into a larger operation, introducing the new Saudi official gazette of Mecca, Umm al-Qur\u0101. Mecca also has its own paper owned by the city, Al Nadwa. However, other Saudi newspapers are also provided in Mecca such as the Saudi Gazette, Al Madinah, Okaz and Al Bilad, in addition to other international newspapers.\n\n\n=== TV ===\nTelecommunications in the city were emphasized early under the Saudi reign. King Abdulaziz pressed them forward as he saw them as a means of convenience and better governance. While under Hussein bin Ali, there were about 20 public telephones in the entire city; in 1936, the number jumped to 450, totaling about half the telephones in the country. During that time, telephone lines were extended to Jeddah and Ta\u2019if, but not to the capital, Riyadh. By 1985, Mecca, like other Saudi cities, possessed modern telephone, telex, radio and television communications. Many television stations serving the city area include Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al-Ekhbariya, Arab Radio and Television Network and various cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nLimited radio communication was established within the Kingdom under the Hashemites. In 1929, wireless stations were set up in various towns in the region, creating a network that would become fully functional by 1932. Soon after World War II, the existing network was greatly expanded and improved. Since then, radio communication has been used extensively in directing the pilgrimage and addressing the pilgrims. This practice started in 1950, with the initiation of broadcasts on the Day of 'Arafah (9 Dhu al-Hijjah), and increased until 1957, at which time Radio Makkah became the most powerful station in the Middle East at 50 kW. Later, power was increased 9-fold to 450 kW. Music was not immediately broadcast, but gradually folk music was introduced.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe only airport even close to Mecca is the Mecca East airport, which is not active. Mecca is primarily served by King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah for international and regional connections and Ta'if Regional Airport for regional connections. To cater the large number of Hajj pilgrims, this airport has Hajj Terminal, specifically for use in the Hajj season, which can accommodate 47 planes simultaneously and can receive 3,800 pilgrims per hour during the Hajj season.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMecca, similar to Medina, lies at the junction of two of the most important highways in Saudi Arabia, Highway 40, connecting it to the important port city of Jeddah in the west and the capital of Riyadh and the other major port city, Dammam, in the east. The other, Highway 15, connects Mecca to the other holy Islamic city of Medina approximately 400 km (250 mi) in the north and onward to Tabuk and Jordan. While in the south, it connects Mecca to Abha and Jizan. Mecca is served by four ring roads, and these are very crowded compared to the three ring roads of Medina.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\nAl Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro\nThe Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro is a metro line in Mecca opened on 13 November 2010. The 18.1-kilometer (11.2-mile) elevated metro transports pilgrims to the holy sites of 'Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina in the city to reduce congestion on the road and is only operational during the Hajj season. It consists of nine stations, three in each of the aforementioned towns.\n\nMecca Metro\nThe Mecca Metro, officially known as Mecca Mass Rail Transit, is a planned four-line metro system for the city. This will be in addition to the Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro which carries pilgrims.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n\n==== Intercity ====\nIn 2018, a high speed intercity rail line, part of the Haramain High Speed Rail Project, named the Haramain high-speed railway line entered operation, connecting the holy cities cities of Mecca and Medina together via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City in Rabigh. The railway consists of 35 electric trains and is capable of transporting 60 million passengers annually. Each train can achieve speeds of up to 300 kmh (190 mph), traveling a total distance of 450 km (280 mi), reducing the travel time between the two cities to less than two hours. It was built by a business consortium from Spain.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMedina\nMuhammad\nJabal al-Nour\nSharifate of Mecca\nSaudi conquest of Hejaz\nAbraj al-Bait\nHajj and 'Umrah\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nthe editors of Time-Life Books.

        "wiki": "Medina, officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0629\u200e, romanized: al-Madinat al-Munawwarah, lit. 'The Enlightened City'), commonly simplified as Mad\u012bnah or Madinah, is one of the three holiest cities in Islam and the capital of the Medina Region of Saudi Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782, making it the fourth-most populous city in the country. Located at the core of the Madinah Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293 km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys, agricultural spaces, older dormant volcanoes and the Nafud desert.\nThe city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in Islamic tradition, the other two being Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory. The original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib and it is referred to by the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab (The Confederates). It was renamed Mad\u012bnat an-Nab\u012b (City of the Prophet or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (The Enlightened City), before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in English as Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah al-Munawwarah interchangeably.The city is known to have existed for over 1500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca, otherwise known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), composed of the citizens of Madinah, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun, collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.Much like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short existence. The region is known to have been controlled by Arabian Jewish tribes (up to the 5th century CE), the 'Aws and Khazraj (up to Muhammad's arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622\u2013660 CE), Umayyads (660\u2013749 CE), Abbasids (749\u20131254 CE), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254\u20131517 CE), the Ottomans (1517\u20131805 CE), the First Saudi State (1805\u20131811 CE), Muhammad Ali Pasha (1811\u20131840 CE), the Ottomans for a second time (1840\u20131918), the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca (1918\u20131925 CE) and finally is in the hands of the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1925\u2013present CE).In addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi' cemetery and the Seven Mosques among others. Recently, after the Saudi conquest, the Saudis carried out a demolition of several tombs and domes in and around the region fearing these might become sites of association of others in worship beside Allah (shirk).\n\n\n== History ==\nMedina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n\n==== Yathrib ====\nBefore the advent of Islam, the city was known as Yathrib (pronounced [\u02c8ja\u03b8r\u026ab]; \u064a\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0628). The word Yathrib has been recorded in \u0100yah (verse) 13 of Surah (chapter) 33 of the Qur'an.[Quran 33:13] and is thus known to have been the name of the city up to the Battle of the Trench. Muhammad later forbade calling the city by this name.\n\n\n==== Taybah and Tabah ====\nSometime after the battle, the Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah (the Kind or the Good) ([\u02c8t\u02e4ajba]; \u0637\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629) and Tabah (Arabic: \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0629\u200e) which is of similar meaning. This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, \"Ya Taybah!\" (O Taybah!). The two names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the Kind).\n\n\n==== Madinah ====\nThe city has also been called Madinah in some ahadith. The names al-Mad\u012bnah an-Nabawiyyah (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629) and Mad\u012bnat un-Nab\u012b (both meaning \"City of the Prophet\" or \"The Prophet's City\") and al-Mad\u012bnat ul-Munawwarah (\"The Enlightened City\") are all derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in official documents and road signage, along with Madinah.\n\n\n=== Early history and Jewish control ===\nMedina is known to have been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BC. By the fourth century CE, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish tribes that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Qurayza, and Banu Nadir. Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian Empire's domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the Persian Shah.The situation changed after the arrival of two new Arab tribes, the 'Aws or Banu 'Aws and the Khazraj, also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but later revolted and became independent.\n\n\n=== Under the 'Aws and Khazraj ===\nToward the end of the 5th century, the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the 'Aws and the Khazraj. However, according to Scottish scholar, William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.Early Muslim chronicler Ibn Ishaq tells of an ancient conflict between the last Yemenite king of the Himyarite Kingdom and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognised the Ka'bah as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.Eventually the Banu 'Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's Hijrah (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the 'Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj. They fought a total of four wars.Their last and bloodiest known battle was the Battle of Bu'ath, fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. He was the most respected inhabitant of the city prior to Muhammad's arrival. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of Yathrib met secretly with Muhammad in 'Aqaba, a place outside Mecca, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to the city, where Muhammad could serve a mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n\n=== Under Muhammad and the Rashidun ===\n\nIn 622 CE (1 AH), Muhammad and an estimated 70 Meccan Muhajirun left Mecca over a period of a few months for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced the new religion of Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as the leader of the city. The natives of Yathrib who had converted to Islam of any background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called the Ansar (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the Zakat tax.\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, all parties in the area agreed to the Constitution of Medina, which committed all parties to mutual cooperation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess. In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as Kit\u0101b Dimmat al-Nabi, written in the 17th year of the Hijra (638 CE), and which gave express liberty to Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks. In return, they were to pay the jizya annually for protection by their patrons.\n\n\n==== Battle of Uhud ====\n\nIn the year 625 CE (3 AH), Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a senior chieftain of Mecca who later converted to Islam, led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the Qurayshi army with an estimated 1,000 troops, but just as the army approached the battlefield, 300 men under 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew, dealing a severe blow to the Muslim army's morale. Muhammad continued marching with his now 700-strong force and ordered a group of 50 archers to climb a small hill, now called Jabal ar-Rummaah (The Archers' Hill) to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry and to provide protection to the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to retreat. The frontline was pushed further and further away from the archers and foreseeing the battle to have be a victory for the Muslims, the archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading the rest to not disobey their Muhammad's orders.\nSeeing that the archers were starting to descend from the hill, Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded his unit to ambush the hill and his cavalry unit pursued the descending archers were systematically slain by being caught in the plain ahead of the hill and the frontline, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill who were shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but with little to no effect. However, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Madanis (people of Medina) suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.\n\n\n==== Battle of the Trench ====\n\nIn 627 CE (5 AH), Abu Sufyan led another force toward Medina. Knowing of his intentions, Muhammad asked for proposals for defending the northern flank of the city, as the east and west were protected by volcanic rocks and the south was covered with palm trees. Salman al-Farsi, a Persian Sahabi who was familiar with Sasanian war tactics recommended digging a trench to protect the city and the Prophet accepted it. The subsequent siege came to be became known as the Battle of the Trench and the Battle of the Confederates. After a month-long siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again due to the harsh winter.\nDuring the siege, Abu Sufyan contacted the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the Muslim defenders and effectively encircle the defenders. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Aws negotiated on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to appoint one of their chiefs who had converted to Islam, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason in the Book of Deutoronomy. This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The French historian Robert Mantran proposes that from this point of view it was successful\u2014from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.In the ten years following the hijra, Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he marched on Mecca, entering it without battle in 630 CE or 8 AH. Despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca, the growing importance of Mecca in Islam, the significance of the Ka'bah as the center of the Islamic world, as the direction of prayer (Qibla), and in the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the base of operations of the early Rashidun Caliphate.The city is presumed to have been renamed Madinat al-Nabi (\"City of the Prophet\" in Arabic) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and the city being the site of his burial. Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the Aramaic word Medinta, which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.\nUnder the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the reign of 'Uthman ibn al-Affan, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at some of his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE and assassinated him in his own home. Ali, the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in Iraq for being in a more strategic location. Since then, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power. Medina witnessed little to no economic growth during and after Ali's reign.\n\n\n=== Under subsequent Islamic regimes ===\n\n\n==== Umayyad Caliphate ====\nAfter al-Hasan, the son of 'Ali, ceded power to Mu'awiyah I, son of Abu Sufyan, Mu'awiyah marched into Kufa, Ali's capital, and received the allegiance of the local 'Iraqis. This is considered to be the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. Mu'awiyah's governors took special care of Medina and dug the 'Ayn az-Zarqa'a (\"Blue Spring\") spring along with a project that included the creation of underground ducts for the purposes of irrigation. Dams were built in some of the wadis and the subsequent agricultural boom led to the strengthening of the economy.\n\nFollowing a period of unrest during the Second Fitna in 679 CE (60 AH), Husayn ibn 'Ali was martyred at Karbala and Yazid assumed unchecked control for the next three years. In 682 CE (63 AH), Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself Caliph of Mecca and the people of Medina swore allegiance to him. This led to an eight-year-long period of economic distress for the city. In 692 CE (73 AH), the Umayyads regained power and Medina experienced its second period of huge economic growth. Trade improved and more people moved into the city. The banks of Wadi al-'Aqiq were now lush with greenery. This period of peace and prosperity coincided with the rule of 'Umar ibn Abdulaziz, who many consider to be the fifth of the Rashidun.\n\n\n==== Abbasid Caliphate ====\nAbdulbasit A. Badr, in his book, Madinah, The Enlightened City: History and Landmarks, divides this period into three distinct phases:\n\nBadr describes the period between 749\u2013974 CE (132\u2013363 AH) as a push-and-pull between peace and political turmoil, while Medina continued to pay allegiance to the Abbasids. From 974\u20131151 CE (363\u2013546 AH), Medina was in a liaison with the Fatimids, even though the political stand between the two remained turbulent and did not exceed the normal allegiance. From 1151 CE (546 AH) onwards, Medina paid allegiance to the Zengids, and the Emir Nuruddin Zangi took care of the roads used by pilgrims and funded the fixing of the water sources and streets. When he visited Medina in 1162 CE (557 AH), he ordered the construction of a new wall that encompassed the new urban areas outside the old city wall. Zangi was succeeded by Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, who supported Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Governor of Medina, and greatly funded the growth of the city while slashing taxes paid by the pilgrims. He also funded the Bedouins who lived on the routes used by pilgrims to protect them on their journeys. The later Abbasids also continued to fund the expenses of the city. While Medina was formally allied with the Abbasids during this period, they maintained closer relations with the Zengids and Ayyubids. The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2 m) high, dating from this period, and was flanked with towers. Of its four gates, the Bab al-Salam (\"The Gate of Peace\"), was remarked for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, the west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations.\n\n\n==== Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo ====\nAfter a brutal long conflict with the Abbasids, the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo took over the Egyptian governorate and effectively gained control of Medina. In 1256 CE (Rajab 654 AH), Medina was threatened by lava from the Harrat Rahat volcanic region but was narrowly saved from being burnt after the lava turned northward. During Mamluk reign, the Masjid an-Nabawi caught fire twice. Once in 1256 CE (654 AH), when the storage caught fire, burning the entire mosque, and the other time in 1481 CE (886 AH), when the masjid was struck by lightning. This period also coincided with an increase in scholarly activity in Medina, with scholars such as Ibn Farhun, Al-Hafiz Zain al-Din al-'Iraqi, Al Sakhawi and others settling in the city. The striking iconic Green Dome also found its beginnings as a cupola built under Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun as-Salihi in 1297 CE (678 AH).\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\n\n==== First Ottoman period ====\nIn 1517 CE (923 AH), the first Ottoman period began with Selim I's conquest of Mamluk Egypt. This added Medina to their territory and they continued the tradition of showering Medina with money and aid. In 1532 CE (939 AH), Suleiman the Magnificent built a secure fortress around the city and constructed a strong castle armed by an Ottoman battalion to protect the city. This is also the period in which many of the Prophet's Mosque's modern features were built even though it wasn't painted green yet. These suburbs also had walls and gates. The Ottoman sultans took a keen interest in the Prophet's Mosque and redesigned it over and over to suit their preferences.\n\n\n==== First Saudi insurgency ====\nAs the Ottomans' hold over their domains broke loose, the Madanis pledged alliance to Saud bin Abdulaziz, founder of the First Saudi state in 1805 CE (1220 AH), who quickly took over the city. In 1811 CE (1226 AH), Muhammad Ali Pasha, Ottoman commander and Wali of Egypt, commanded two armies under each of his two sons to seize Medina, the first one, under the elder Towson Pasha, failed to take Medina. But the second one, a larger army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, succeeded after battling a fierce resistance movement.\n\n\n==== Muhammad Ali Pasha's era ====\nAfter defeating his Saudi foes, Muhammad Ali Pasha took over governance of Medina and although he did not formally declare independence, his governance took on more of a semi-autonomous style. Muhammad's sons, Towson and Ibrahim, alternated in the governance of the city. Ibrahim renovated the city's walls and the Prophet's Mosque. He established a grand provision distribution center (taqiyya) to distribute food and alms to the needy and Medina lived a period of security and peace, In 1840 CE (1256 AH), Muhammad moved his troops out of the city and officially handed the city to the central Ottoman command.\n\n\n==== Second Ottoman period ====\n\nFour years in 1844 CE (1260 AH), after Muhammad Ali Pasha's departure, Davud Pasha was given the position of governor of Egypt under the Ottoman sultan. Davud was responsible for renovating the Prophet's mosque on Sultan Abdulmejid I's orders. When Abdul Hamid II assumed power, he made Medina stand out of the desert with a number of modern marvels, including a radio communication station, an power plant for the Prophet's Mosque and its immediate vicinity, a telegraph line between Medina and Istanbul, and the Hejaz railway which ran from Damascus to Medina with a planned extension to Mecca. Within one decade, the population of the city multiplied by leaps and bounds and reached 80,000. Around this time, Medina started falling prey to a new threat, the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca in the south. Medina witnessed the longest siege in its history during and after World War I.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Sharifate of Mecca and Saudi conquest ====\nThe Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, first attacked Medina on 6 June 1916 CE or 4 Sha'aban 1334 AH, in the middle of World War I. Four days later, Husayn held Medina in a bitter 3-year siege, during which the people faced food shortages, widespread disease and mass emigration. Fakhri Pasha, governor of Medina, tenaciously held on during the Siege of Medina from 10 June 1916 and refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the Armistice of Moudros, until he was arrested by his own men and the city was taken over by the Sharifate on 10 January 1919. Husayn largely won the war due to his alliance with the British. In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly dispatched the Sacred Relics of Muhammad to the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. As of 1920, the British described Medina as \"much more self-supporting than Mecca.\" After the Great War, the Sharif of Mecca, Sayyid Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, the people of Medina secretly entered an agreement with Ibn Saud in 1924, and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz conquered Medina as part of the Saudi conquest of Hejaz on 5 December 1925 (19 Jumada I 1344 AH) which gave way to the whole of the Hejaz being incorporated into the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n==== Under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ====\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focused more on the expansion of the city and the demolition of former sites that violated Islamic principles and Islamic law such as the tombs at al-Baqi. Nowadays, the city mostly only holds religious significance and as such, just like Mecca, has given rise to a number of hotels surrounding the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, which unlike the Masjid Al-\u1e24ar\u0101m, is equipped with an underground parking. The old city's walls have been destroyed and replaced with the three ring roads that encircle Medina today, named in order of length, King Faisal Road, King Abdullah Road and King Khalid Road. Medina's ring roads generally see less traffic overall compared to the four ring roads of Mecca.\n\nAn international airport, named the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport, now serves the city and is located on Highway 340, known locally as the Old Qassim Road. The city now sits at the crossroads of two major Saudi Arabian highways, Highway 60, known as the Qassim\u2013Medina Highway, and Highway 15 which connects the city to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk in the north and onward, known as the Al Hijrah Highway or Al Hijrah Road, after Muhammad's journey. The old Ottoman railway system was shutdown after their departure from the region and the old railway station has now been converted into a museum. The city has recently seen another connection and mode of transport between it and Mecca, the Haramain high-speed railway line connects the two cities via King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh, King Abdulaziz International Airport and the city of Jeddah in under 3 hours.\nThough the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, the Haram area of Medina itself is much smaller than that of Mecca and Medina has recently seen an increase in the number of Muslim and Non-Muslim expatriate workers of other nationalities, most commonly South Asian peoples and people from other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded al-Masjid an-Nabawi.\n\n\n==== Destruction of heritage ====\n\nSaudi Arabia is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to shirk (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old. Critics have described this as \"Saudi vandalism\" and claim that 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost in Medina and Mecca over the last 50 years. The most famous example of this is the demolition of al-Baqi.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMedina is located in the Hejaz region which is a 200 km (124 mi) wide strip between the Nafud desert and the Red Sea. Located approximately 720 km (447 mi) northwest of Riyadh which is at the center of the Saudi desert, the city is 250 km (155 mi) away from the west coast of Saudi Arabia and at an elevation of approximately 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. It lies at 39\u00ba36' longitude east and 24\u00ba28' latitude north. It covers an area of about 589 square kilometres (227 square miles). The city has been divided into twelve (12) districts, 7 of which have been categorised as urban districts, while the other 5 have been categorised as suburban.\n\n\n=== Elevation ===\nLike most cities in the Hejaz region, Medina is situated at a very high elevation. Almost three times as high as Mecca, the city is situated at 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Mount Uhud is the highest peak in Medina and is 1,077 meters (3,533 feet) tall.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains and volcanic hills. The soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly basalt, while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era.  It is surrounded by a number of famous mountains, most notably Jabal Al-Hujjaj (The Pilgrims' Mountain) to the west, Sal'aa Mountain to the north-west, Jabal al-'Ir or Caravan Mountain to the south and Mount Uhud to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the tripoint of the three valleys (wadis) of Wadi al 'Aql, Wadi al 'Aqiq, and Wadi al Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry deserted mountainous region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Medina falls in a hot desert climate region (BWh). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about 43 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) with nights about 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F). Temperatures above 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May. In summer, the wind is north-western, while in the spring and winters, is south-western.\n\n\n== Significance in Islam ==\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of two mosques, Masjid Quba'a and al-Masjid an-Nabawi. Both of these mosques were built by Muhammad himself. Islamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times in the Quran, two examples are Surah At-Tawbah. verse 101 and Al-Hashr. verse 8. Medinan suras are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts and they are also larger in number. Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in Sahih Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik said the Prophet said: \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people.\"\n\n\n=== The Prophet's Mosque (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) ===\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a prayer in The Prophet's Mosque equates to 1,000 prayers in any other mosque except the Masjid al-Haram where one prayer equates to 100,000 prayers in any other mosque. The mosque was initially just an open space for prayer with a raised and covered minbar (pulpit) built within seven months and was located beside the Prophet's rawdhah (residence, although the word literally means garden) to its side along with the houses of his wives. The mosque was expanded several times throughout history, with many of its internal features developed overtime to suit contemporary standards.\n\nThe modern Prophet's Mosque is famed for the Green Dome situated directly above the Prophet's rawdhah, which currently serves as the burial site for Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab and is used in road signage along with its signature minaret as an icon for Medina itself. The entire piazza of the mosque is shaded from the sun by 250 membrane umbrellas. \n\n\n=== Quba'a Mosque ===\n\nIt is Sunnah to perform prayer at the Quba'a Mosque. According to a hadith, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad said, \"Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\"\nand in another narration,\"Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque \u2013 meaning the Mosque of Quba\u2019 \u2013 and prays there, that will be equivalent to \u2018Umrah.\"It has been recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim that Muhammad used to go to Quba'a every Saturday to offer two rak'ahs of Sunnah prayer. The mosque at Quba'a was built by Muhammad himself upon his arrival to the old city of Medina. Quba'a and the mosque has been referred in the Qur'an indirectly in Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108.\n\n\n=== Other sites ===\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Qiblatayn ====\n\nMasjid al-Qiblatayn is another mosque historically important to Muslims. Muslims believe that Muhammad was commanded to change his direction of prayer (qibla) from praying toward Jerusalem to praying toward the Ka'bah at Mecca, as he was commanded in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 143 and 144. The mosque is currently being expanded to be able to hold more than 4,000 worshippers.\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Fath and the Seven Mosques ====\n\nThree of these historic six mosques were combined recently into the larger Masjid al-Fath with an open courtyard. Sunni sources claim that there is no hadith or any other evidence to prove that Muhammad may have said something about the virtue of these mosques.\n\n\n==== Al-Baqi' Cemetery ====\n\nAl-Baqi' is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of Muhammad, caliphs and scholars are known to have been buried.\n\n\n=== In Islamic eschatology ===\n\n\n==== End of civilization ====\nConcerning the end of civilization in Medina, Abu Hurairah is recorded to have said that Muhammad said:\"The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada'h, they will fall down on their faces dead.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 98)Sufyan ibn Abu Zuhair said Muhammad said:\"Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 99)\n\n\n==== Protection from plague and ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah) ====\n\nWith regards to Medina's protection from plague and ad-Dajjal, the following ahadith were recorded:\n\nby Abu Bakra:\"The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 103)by Abu Hurairah:\"There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 104)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2018, the recorded population was 2,188,138, with a growth rate of 2.32%. Being a destination of Muslims from around the world, Medina witnesses illegal immigration after performing Hajj or Umrah, despite the strict rules the government has enforced. However, the Central Hajj Commissioner Prince Khalid bin Faisal stated that the numbers of illegal staying visitors dropped by 29% in 2018.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion followed by the majority of the population of Medina.\nSunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali) constitute the majority, while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the Nakhawila. Outside the haram, there are significant numbers of Non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSimilar to that of Mecca, Medina exhibits a cross-cultural environment, a city where people of many nationalities and cultures live together and interact with each other on a daily basis. This only helps the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. Established in 1985, the biggest publisher of Quran in the world, it employs around 1100 people and publishes 361 different publications in many languages. It is reported that more than 400,000 people from around the world visit the complex every year. Every visitor is gifted a free copy of the Qur'an at the end of a tour of the facility.\n\n\n=== Museums and arts ===\nThe Al Madinah Museum has several exhibits concerning the cultural and historical heritage of the city featuring different archaeological collections, visual galleries and rare images of the old city. It is also includes the Hejaz Railway Museum. The Dar Al Madinah Museum opened in 2011 and it uncovers the history of Medina specializing in the architectural and urban heritage of the city. There is no archaeology or architecture from the time of Mohammed, except what remains of a few stone defensive towers The Holy Qur'an Exhibition houses rare manuscripts of the Quran, along with other exhibitions that encircle the Masjid an-Nabawi. \nThe Madinah Arts Center, founded in 2018 and operated by the MMDA's Cultural Wing, focuses on modern and contemporary arts. The center aims to enhance arts and enrich the artistic and cultural movement of society, empowering artists of all groups and ages. As of February 2020, before the implementation of social distancing measures and curfews, it held more than 13 group and solo art galleries, along with weekly workshops and discussions. The center is located in King Fahd Park, close to Quba Mosque on an area of 8,200 square meters (88,264 square feet)In 2018, the MMDA launched Madinah Forum of Arabic Calligraphy, an annual forum to celebrate Arabic calligraphy and renowned Arabic calligraphers. The event includes discussions about Arabic Calligraphy, and a gallery to show the work of 50 Arabic calligraphers from 10 countries. The Dar al-Qalam Center for Arabic Calligraphy is located to the northwest of the Masjid an-Nabawi, just across the Hejaz Railway Museum. In April 2020, it was announced that the center was renamed the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Center for Arabic Calligraphy, and upgraded to an international hub for Arabic Calligraphers, in conjunction with the \"Year of Arabic Calligraphy\" event organized by the Ministry of Culture during the years 2020 and 2021.Other projects launched by the MMDA Cultural Wing include the Madinah Forum of Live Sculpture held at Quba Square, with 16 sculptors from 11 countries. The forum aimed to celebrate sculpture as it is an ancient art, and to attract young artists to this form of art.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSaudi Arabia is renowned for its passion of football around the world. Medina hosts two football clubs, Al Ansar FC, and Ohod FC, with their shared home venue at Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Stadium.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHistorically, Medina's economy was dependent on the sale of dates and other agricultural activities. As of 1920, 139 varieties of dates were being grown in the area, along with other vegetables. Religious tourism plays a major part in Medina's economy, being the second holiest city in Islam, and holding many historical Islamic locations, it attracts more than 7 million annual visitors who come to perform Hajj during the Hajj season, and Umrah throughout the year.Medina has two industrial areas, the larger one was established in 2003 with a total area of 10,000,000 m2, and managed by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON). It is located 50 km from Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport, and 200 km from Yanbu Commercial Port, and has 236 factories, which produce petroleum products, building materials, food products, and many other products. The Knowledge Economic City (KEC) is a Saudi Arabian joint stock company founded in 2010. It focuses on real estate development and knowledge-based industries. The project is under development and is expected to highly increase the number of jobs in Medina by its completion.\n\n\n== Human resources ==\n\n\n=== Education and scholarly activity ===\n\n\n==== Primary and secondary education ====\nThe Ministry of Education is the governing body of education in the al-Madinah Province and it operates 724 and 773 public schools for boys and girls respectively throughout the province. Taibah High School is one of the most notable schools in Saudi Arabia. Established in 1942, it was the second-largest school in the country at that time. Many Saudi ministers and government officials have graduated from this high school, which gives it a reputation of excellence and historical importance.\n\n\n==== Higher education and research ====\nTaibah University is a public university providing higher education for the residents of the province, it has 28 colleges, of which 16 are in Medina. It offers 89 academic programs and has a strength of 69210 students as of 2020. The Islamic University, established in 1961, is the oldest higher education institution in the region, with around 22000 students enrolled. It offers majors in Sharia, Qur'an, Usul ad-Din, Hadith, and the Arabic language. The university offers Bachelor of Arts degrees and also Master's and Doctorate degrees. The admission is open to Muslims based on scholarships programs that provide accommodation and living expenses. In 2012, the university expanded its programs by establishing the College of Science, which offers Engineering and Computer science majors. Al Madinah College of Technology, which is governed by TVTC, offers a variety of degree programs including Electrical engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer Sciences and Electronic Sciences. Private universities at Medina include University of Prince Muqrin, the Arab Open University, and Al Rayyan Colleges.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nMedina is served by the Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz International Airport located off Highway 340. It handles domestic flights, while it has scheduled international services to regional destinations in the Middle East. It is the fourth-busiest airport in Saudi Arabia, handling 8,144,790 passengers in 2018. The airport project was announced as the world's best by Engineering News-Record's 3rd Annual Global Best Projects Competition held on September 10, 2015. The airport also received the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certificate in the MENA region. The airport receives higher numbers of passengers during the Hajj.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nIn 2015, the MMDA announced Darb as-Sunnah (Sunnah Path) Project, which aims to develop and transform the 3 km (2 mi) Quba'a Road connecting the Quba'a Mosque to the al-Masjid an-Nabawi to an avenue, paving the whole road for pedestrians and providing service facilities to the visitors. The project also aims to revive the Sunnah where Muhammed used to walk from his house (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) to Quba'a every Saturday afternoon.The city of Medina lies at the junction of two of the most important Saudi highways, Highway 60 and Highway 15. Highway 15 connects Medina to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk and Jordan in the north. Highway 60 connects the city with Yanbu, a port city on the Red Sea in the west and Al Qassim in the east. The city is served by three ring roads: King Faisal Road, a 5 km ring road that surrounds Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, King Abdullah Road, a 27 km road that surrounds most of urban Medina and King Khalid Road is the biggest ring road that surrounds the whole city and some rural areas with 60 km of roads.\n\n\n=== Bus and rapid transit ===\n\nThe bus transport system in Medina was established in 2012 by the MMDA and is operated by SAPTCO. The newly established bus system includes 10 lines connecting different regions of the city to Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, and serves around 20,000 passengers on a daily basis. In 2017, the MMDA launched the Madinah Sightseeing Bus service. Open top buses take passengers on sightseeing trips throughout the day with two lines and 11 destinations, including Masjid an-Nabawi, Quba'a Mosque and Masjid al-Qiblatayn and offers audio tour guidance with 8 different languages. By the end of 2019, the MMDA announced its plan to expand the bus network with 15 BRT lines. The project was set to be done in 2023. In 2015, the MMDA announced a three-line metro project in extension to the public transportation master plan in Medina.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe historic Ottoman railways were shutdown and the railway stations, including the one in Medina, were converted into museums by the Saudi government. The Haramain High Speed Railway (HHR) came into operation in 2018, linking Medina and Mecca, and passes through three stations: Jeddah, King Abdul Aziz International Airport, and King Abdullah Economic City. It runs along 444 kilometres (276 miles) with a speed of 300 km/h, and has an annual capacity of 60 million passengers.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMubarakpuri, Safiur Rahman (2011).

Personally I enjoyed walking around the tiny lanes and seeing all the produce there was the offer. The design on the old",
          "Medina of Fez is a place that gives you mixed feelings. It's old and enchanting and peculiar. People ride horses and donkeys and still work their own products. But also full of new merchandise and dirty and noisy and smelly. You can find animal products laying around in the sun",
          "This is a huge ancient centuries old souk/medina. If shopping or eating is your thing this is the place. Just explore and accept that the fact you will get lost. I was surprised the hawkers and sellers were not particularly pushy. Be careful against getting directions from",
          "The Medina is MASSIVE!!! It is full of shops of all types, food cafes, & streets galore. Now the streets are narrow, & with shops & stall wares spilling out into the halls, it can feel a bit claustrophobic at times, but during the off season we found a lot of things. I was on",
          "Love it. Went with our family--three teenagers. Surprisingly, always felt safe. People were very respectful. Enjoyed visiting, taking it all in, and shopping. We had a guide--probably a better way to do it for the first visit. However, it was just amazing and fun.",
          "You can literally buy almost anything within the Medina and I would advise bartering with the locals who are more than happy to review the price. If you are of a delicate nature however it is not the place for you.",
          "Beautiful place. Came with my wife and its so nice. Old medina has great food. Hire a guide. Go to riad mizar to stay.",
          "Go with a guide. This is more confusing than the Marrakesh medina. I highly recommend the guide services of Fettah - I did a separate review. I did the medina in both Fes and Marrakesh. The Marrakesh medina felt more western/touristy. Like the French Quarter of New Orleans,",
          "I loved the ancient city of Fez, with its hundreds of narrow alleyways, or derbs. No scooters or bikes or mules are allowed, unlike other cities such as Marrakech. So you don\u2019t have to watch your back all the time! The souks are amazing, with craftsmanship from tanneries to wood",
          "Amazing experience. Great shopping, too. Be sure to hire a tour guide because without one you will get lost in the medina.",
          "I had seen so many descriptions of how complicated it is to navigate the Medina and how people are lying in wait to guide tourists and then extort large tips. My experience was completely different. I used the well-known \"maps\" app on my phone, which was fairly detailed and",
          "We hired a guide for $60. 3 people don't bad. You can do it alone but will not see nearly as much. Do not come to Fes and miss the Medina! Wow!",
          "If you want to see and feel the native, cultural, religious and historic vibe of Morroco come and spend a few nights in the Medina of Fes. I stayed in a basic but fantastic, family (14 and 11 years) run Riyad (Dar el Arfaoui) with my family. We explored the markets, tannery,",
          "We had a guided tour and it took several hours to walk through the hundreds of streets and alleyways. A million shops selling everything and very crowded. You must have a guide.",
          "The Medina is tricky and with a lot of locals trying to get some money from you, better go alone with enough information about the city or a guide to save time. Tannery, Mosque al Qaraouiyine, market of spices should be definitely included in your trip.",
          "The Medina of fez is beautiful. There are so many places to shop and small cafes or restaurants. Definitely be careful with the people because they try to get you to walk into small alley ways.. specifically the ones selling the cow skin! Don\u2019t follow them. They may seem nice",
          "There are actually 2 or 3 separate Medina's in Fez. The oldest is from 9(?) century, and it is really nice. Second was created by Jews from Spain in 14 century, and it is extremely interesting. Many old buildings are still intact.",
          "Get a guide. All I can say. Crazy!! This is the most overwhelming maze crazed place I have ever been. There are stalls of cheap Chinese crap masquerading as Morocco goods and then actual Morocco goods. Get a guide to know the difference",
          "This is the oldest Medina in Marrocos, so it is more roots then Marrakech and also more calm. Motorbikes and cars are not allowed inside the Medina, different from Marrakech, so this helps you in walk safely and calm in more of 9k of streets. Inside the Medina you cannot find",
          "Feels like back in the 9th century! No motorized vehicles allowed (like in Marrakech medina) so it really feels like back in time! Only hand carts, donkeys and walking is allowed! nice shops and restaurants and lovely people and NOT pushing sales people - yes really!!",
          "One thing we know and that\u2019s we needed more time for our visit in Fes. Three nights with two days exploring wasn\u2019t enough. Our guide Zachariah was exceptional as it\u2019s the only way to see all this hidden gems and enjoy it properly. It was a load of fun!",
          "We really enjoyed our time walking and exploring the M\u00e9dina. On our first trip into the media we hired a guide for 3 hours to get us orientated. I think that this was a good idea as not only did we see many of the cultural sites we also could relax in the fact that we were never",
          "The Blue Gate (Bab Boujloud) welcomes you to the Medina, which is a maze of souks and locals going about their everyday business. Streets are very narrow and there are lots of people about but sellers (with the possible exception of restaurant servers) are not pushy and you can",
          "When I say large in the title, I mean by surface. Bo no means are the streets of medina large - quite opposite, they are narrow and they say medina has 3,500 of them. You will be warped hundreds of years ago, to see how textile is colored (procedure is the same old one, even the",
          "I like the medina of Fez more then in Marrakesh and Essouira. It is small and really authentic Marocco. The sellers are nog pushing unless you show some respect that you not interested.",
          "This is a huge medina full of narrow cobbled streets, varied sights, smells and experiences. I would recommend a tour as it would be very easy to get lost. You get into the real culture and life of the locals, who were friendly and we felt comfortably safe. It does get a bit",
          "Good place to buy Moroccan souvenirs like ceramics, table cloth, accessories, argan oil, leather products etc. Google map is good enough and trust yourself to walk into some lanes that aren\u2019t showed in google map but right direction to your destination. U can ask how to go",
          "Basically Fez is the medina. The largest one existing. Do not be fool to go on your own. Take a guide or you will be lost soon in the labirinth of streets. Amazing for photos and good for shopping. Specially keather and silk.",
          "Walked around the Medina for 1 hour. Saw everything I wanted to. Had a good time. Finish with lunch at RUined Garden (inside the Medina)",
          "Amazing site, full of surprises and interesting experiences. It has definitely been one of the highlights of our trip to Morocco.",
          "My friend and I spent about 6 hours in the M\u00e9dina with a knowledgeable local guide (imperative unless you are very adventuresome and have an incredible sense of direction). My friend is an architect and I am very interested in decorative arts, and for both of us this was a feast",
          "We visited the Medina with my family. This is a huge bazaar probably similar to how it was over last 1000 years. There is a lot of walking, lot of noise and confusion but it is a lot of fun. There are alleyways so narrow that only one person could walk through them. And endless",
          "Medina of Fez is just so beautiful. There is a huge history and stories behind this town. It has the world\u2019s first university as well. I have seen the most narrow street where you cannot pass without tilting your body. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the people",
          "My favourite Medina of all Morocco. Very interesting and historic. The leather tannery was my favourite part. We had a tour guide although with Google Map, we could have just done it on our own.",
          "Walk these passages of time and mingle with the young and old as you walk between times. You do not have to spend a cent but that is your loss.",
          "Beautiful markets within the medina. Small quarters inside, but not the hustle and bustle of Marrekesh. Maps inside some districts to help guide you and everyone was friendly.",
          "We were lucky to visit the Medina on Friday. With less crowd And more time to walk through the Medina at own pace. The people are not aggressive as in Marrakesh and most of them are very open and friendly to foreigners.",
          "The Medina has narrow streets and is a Labyrinth of alleys and streets. Great way to enjoy Fes and Morocco. From what I saw and heard not recommended to come here by yourself as you may get lost. Most of the vendors are overpriced and try to take advantage of you - worst are the",
          "The good, the great and the ugly all in one place. There is a great carpet coop in a caravanserai, the dye alley, pottery and tanning quarters are definitely worth a detour. Of course poverty also strikes those who are not used to it. Nut to think this medina has been around",
          "This place is awesome. The narrow streets, souks, and overall atmosphere is excellent. The people of Fes are warm and inviting. I would say that you want to spend no more than 2 full days in this area.",
          "We were in Fes and were walking to a restaurant in the Medina when a crowd came down the street leading a cow and a bull by rope and tail. They crowded around the entrance to the mosque and were singing songs of joy. We later found out that this has become an annual tradition",
          "Wondrous old Medina. Labyrinthine bazaar packed full of shops. A kaleidoscope of people, things, smells, tastes, sounds. Be ready for adventure. And bring a compass!",
          "The Fes medina is amazing for anyone who loves history, architecture, the Middle East, or handmade stuff. It\u2019s terrible for people who really value cleanliness, being left alone, or big, open spaces. As someone who\u2019s a bit antisocial, I still had a great time because the culture",
          "It\u2019s always fun to walk through the M\u00e9dina exploring, enjoying the crafts and looking for places to eat. I would suggest down loading \u201cmap me\u201d app so that you can navigate. It can be rather annoying when savvy guides try to mislead you by saying something is in the opposite",
          "The M\u00e9dina (old walled city) is a surprising labyrinth of tiny street. The souk, a collection of tiny shops, almost requires a guide to get around. We stayed in a riad, or converted private home, which proved to be lovely. We walked up a little alley and then went into this",
          "Before coming to the M\u00e9dina just accept the fact that the HUSSLE here has been perfected over the last 1000 years. Graduate level application of sales at all times. Just appreciate it as part of the experience. The streets are a maze of aromas, sites, people, animals and",
          "Have visited several Medinas already and found some of the vendors here to be more aggressive than other places. Particularly surrounding the Taneriees were rude.",
          "I was prepared to get lost but had a pocket WiFi and a map. Still got lost. Internet is intermittent at best and only when there is clear sky overhead, which is not often. Spent several days exploring it and just got into getting lost and finding treasures.",
          "Love this, definitely worth it to visit. A different experience. Always needs to bargain the prices at least 40%",
          "We arrived in Fes on a wet afternoon and probably, like most people, struggled to find our Riad so were weary when we got there. The following day however, we decided to wander the many alleyways of the medina. It is a fascinating place, full of colour and new experiences around",
          "Incredibly large and easy to get lost without a local guide. Very nice is walking in the medina without traffic, very interesting and a unique experience.",
          "Large, magical and mysterious. Days of exploration. Get lost in color, scents , textures and happy faces. Bustling with energy and activity as day progresses. Nights tend to turn off compared with Marrakech.",
          "This medina is probably no 1 in the country when it comes to size and the variety of crafts that can be observed. The tanners area being the highlight smell- and view wise.",
          "This Medina was interesting and huge. We have lived in a few Arabic countries, spanning over several years, so are used to Medina\u2019s and their type of shopping. We found the Moroccans in Fez Medina polite and not intimidating. They did not insist if you declined their offers.",
          "The winding narrow alleyways lead you down in the the depths of old Fes. The place is full of activity and people selling their wares. Inevitably some touristy souvenirs, but lots of traditional items too!",
          "This place is a vast labryrinth of narrow streets, alleys, shops, homes and more. It is something to experience and best done with a guide so you don't get lost. There are plenty of interesting things to see and lots of items to bargain for. I suggest going early in the morning",
          "Fes M\u00e9dina was an interesting experience, a massive culture shock coming from the western world. There is lots of local handmade crafts and lots of food / cuts of meat (which can be quite confronting). Would recommend going with a guide because it can be very very easy to get",
          "Noisy, colorful, chaotic, smelly in places such as the tannery, busy and crowded. Full of shops selling almost everything and workshops where craftsmen are doing metal/ wood and leather work. If you like to experience the culture of a place you need to go",
          "Of course, you should come here. Just be prepared to get lost a bit. Walking GPS sometimes worked. If you are a woman with no company of man/men you will most likely be bothered. I was there with a female friend. We were harassed by multiple men, one made us a bit nervous. We",
          "Crowded and broken passages with what smells like raw sewerage flowing in street. Had to focus on anything other than where you step and how to find your way out.",
          "Before you get to a sighting area , you will be offered a stem of Mint, a great help to stop the smell of the Tanneries, excellent for photographs and as you step down you can see the results of the dyed leather on offer in Bags & Jackets etc",
          "Apparently it wasn't that complicated to navigate there. I liked to talk to some people, but normally you should avoid people who \"wants to show you way\".",
          "As part of our tour of Fes, we visited the tanneries, which had a reputation of strong smells emitting from the many vats used for tanning the various animal skins. As you arrive you are given a sprig of mint, presumably to sniff, to ward off the \"smell\" However, this was not",
          "You can seriously spend a good chunk of time walking around the medina. Get lost!! It'll happen no matter what. Make sure you barter the prices too!!",
          "If you like chaos and raw smells of sewerage this is for you. Broken, narrow streets with multiple vendors. Interesting to view but not pleasant and not a place this spoiled america would shop in.",
          "This is not something that you will see in North or south America. It is a historic mind blowing piece of architects. Small very small narrow street and routes so many vendors different kind of good Some of them are locally made. It will take you an hour and a half to two hours",
          "The walking tour goes through much of the medina. I would have gotten lost if there was no tour guide. So many different alleyways going in different directions can be very disorientating. Beautiful shops and restaurants. A must see and do if in Fez.",
          "We were on an organised tour so were directed through various parts of the Medina. There are pro's and con's for going solo or organised but we were very happy to stay with the group after originally thinking about doing our own thing. It is certainly a very interesting view of",
          "So many interesting streets and alleys offering everything from shopping to restaurants to a tannery. We were with a tour guide and his assistant in the back or our group to make sure that we did not get side tracked or lost.. Suggest you do the same. Visiting the tannery and",

          "Our first evening, we hated it... However, after one day, we changed our mind and enjoyed our stay. The medina is a maze and some local people try to get benefit from it and abuse tourists. Once we know better our way and how to cope with those people, Fez is a great city to",
          "A must-see for anyone visiting Morocco Snake charmers, dentures and false teeth, monkeys, spices, leather, metalware, ceramics, fruits, vegetables, olives, clothing, scarves...so many bargains!",
          "The medina is a maze of miles of crowded, sometimes steep-sloped narrow pathways, lined with walls and small shops, and covered in places that dates from the 9th century. The paths, or streets, wind and turn. They are poorly marked, and GPS isn't reliable. It's very easy to get",
          "It's not if you get lost, it's when you get lost I the medina! However, its part of the experibce and you will be able to figure your way out or ask someone nice and they'll help you. I ran in the medina from our dar (hotel) several times during our stay and each time I",
          "The medina of Fez is fantastic. 9000 streets and something interesting on every one. Lots of veggies, spices and meats (look out for a camel head) as well as clothing, tanneries etc. You could spend days in here so give yourself plenty of time but also best to hire a local",
          "It's a great maze of streets. When we went with a reputable guide we did not get hassled. When we went by ourselves we got hassled none stop. Some of our favorites- -A local will follow you around unasked and talk to you, eventually wanting money. -they will offer to show",
          "Very interesting old city. Unfortunately there are many unfriendly and aggressive Arabs there. Not a good atmosphere.",
          "We spent 3 days in Riad El Moqri near Palace Faraj, the second you exit the door, there will be locals that are trying to make contact. They are following you, speaking the street is closed, don't go there. even if you are trying not to notice him, he will call next friend that",
          "We had 5 days in the M\u00e9dina overall . Temperature in Fes great in Medina in November - never above 25 in day, cool at night. Recommend getting a recommended guide from your Riad for half or full day on first day to get your orientation - but you will get a bit lost at some",
          "the best place to get lost in a medina where there are more than 9400 streets, where at the end all the streets seem the same, colorful, lively, full of fragrances ... don't forget to take a peppermint and stick it in your nose before going to the tannery",
          "The oldest and largest in Morocco, Fez' medina is also the most endlessly rewarding. Its twisting, intertwining passageways are always fascinating, in whatever direction one chooses to wander. Unique among the country's traditional centers, the Fez medina still preserves some of",
          "We visited the M\u00e9dina on a rainy November morning which added to the ambiance of the old city. If you start up on the hill at the Blue Gate, you can walk down hill and exit at the bottom of the city. It\u2019s a lot easier walking down hill! You also walk back in time as the city",
          "The best place to lose your way completely. Medina is one huge market place with narrow paths between the stalls, going in all directions. It is a good idea to have a guide or just walk straight forward and back. If not, there is no telling where you will come out of this chaos.",
          "Walk around, get lost, try the street-food (sausage sandwiches, snails in broth, broad bean soup) and stop around to visit the mosques in this wonderful medina, which despite some tourist feels extremely authentic. We walked all over the place during the day and always felt",
          "Narrow streets, smelly but colourful, as this was the first medina I have ever visited, was a bit of cultural shock. But it's a must see, as it really gives the feeling of Morocco. Visit the leather and carpets shops, talk and nagotiate with sellers, touch the old walls, and",
          "If you're visiting Morocco, it's not because there are a lot of attractions such as monuments, churches, museums, the pyramids etc. to see. Roman ruins in the country are limited (although Volubilis and Chellah measure up) and you can't even go into the mosques unless you are",
          "Again this Medina is so different from Marakesh and somewhat crazy. Alleys are narrower and can get lost easily even with a tour guide and small bus party! So very interesting and what photos I got just showing the locals everyday life. Fab.",
          "If you roam freely you'll probably get lost. Is that a bad thing? Not really, unless you don't like leaving your confort zone. The movement of people, the tiny streets, the smells, the animals, everything comes together in this place to make for a crazy experience.",
          "soooo much less tourist-y than marrakech medina, and i enjoyed it much better because of that. i would say it's much more confusing to navigate in some ways as well, but for me that was part of what i loved. NO motorbikes to dodge either! :)",
          "Great place to visit and see local handicrafts. Leatherwork, textiles, metal work, food ect. It is fascinating to see how some of the techniques have not changed over hundreds of years and how skilful these craftsman. Worth a look before all skills like this are list.",
          "The medina is a concentrated experience for all things Morocco, foot and moped traffic, donkey carts, shoulder-to-shoulder humanity, and anything you might want to eat or buy. The tour guides seem intent to frighten you and make you fear the vendors, but we found everyone",
          "Much cleaner as Marrakech and friendly. Souvenirs are cheaper too. We liked to wander through the different Souks. Don\u2019t miss the tanneries.",
          "Informative demonstrations of various hand crafts. Ceramics was The best. Leather tanning, copper work and textiles.",
          "One cannot go to Fes and not spend a day here. Hire a private guide rather than getting lost by yourself (guaranteed!) or joining a conga-line group experience. Get a feel for the items to buy and go back later or the ne t day to bargain and possibly buy. Being here is akin",
          "I was a little nervous as a solo traveller visiting Fes Medina. On my first day in Fes I took a Full day tour of the Medina. I was so pleased I did because it gave me a general layout of where to go. Fes Medina is ok as long as you go with the mindset that the sole purpose (in",
          "Worth to visit. You can spend a day here to experience the old town and local market . Is less crowded compare to Marrakesh.",
          "Dirty, smells very bad. really not for me. Avoid it if you can, it's really not worth it. Better see the nature.",
          "The old medina of fes was a perfect getaway. Or was a Step back in Time. A complete return to the mideval era",
          "We walked through the Medina for 2 days, sometimes we got lost but we did not care, it was amazing, beautiful and filled with history, culture and interesting people, small eateries and interesting artisans. We skipped the trip adviser guides and got our Riad to organise a local",
          "First of all, the people. Fes is the education capital of Morocco and this was borne out by our personal interactions. If you're not a timid traveler and don't mind a little confusion (there's always Google maps), the Medina is the place to get the true flavor of history,",
          "A little on the nose to be expected, however it is a fact of life that if you like leather shoes and clothing this is wear it comes from. Enjoyed the experience but felt sorry for the men that worked there.",
          "We did a guided tour with the company that organize a whole tour for us(10 days from casablanca and end back to Casablanc), this company offer a guided tour in Fes and the guide \"Hassan\" was very nice guy and give us so so much informations about this city and it real history",
          "Omar, our guide was great.... pleasant and very knowledgeable. Our tour was on Friday, which is the quietest day in the Medina, as the locals were preparing for the 2nd prayers.",
          "This was a nice M\u00e9dina to walk through without hundreds of motorbikes of Marrakech. Lots of sights to see within.",
          "Having been to several Medina's in Morocco, I found the Fez Medina to be overcrowded with people, animals, and carts. It was very difficult to get around because of the locals and the tourist. While it had many interesting old buildings for example the Caravansary (travel",

You can find anything in this M\u00e9dina, as you walk through timeless alleys and streets( too small to call streets really). Don\u2019t try",
          "This Medina was outstanding to me due to the variety of things to see. I really enjoyed walking through winding old residential \"streets\" that were barely shoulder width. The souks were extensive but more orderly than others such as Marrakesh, where I had to resist rolling",
          "The Medinas of Fez are fascinating. They provide a glimpse into life as it has been lived by the Berber people of Morocco for centuries. It is an incredible maze of narrow streets, connected by even narrower streets and tunnels. Vendors line the main streets. Because the streets",
          "You will definitely get lost without a local guide who will show you all the palaces to visit in one day!! A fantastic way to spend the day discovering a small section of the 9,400 + streets that exist in Fes! We also ventured bravely on our own the next day on Friday to see a",
          "Probably the highlight of our Moroccan tour discovering & exploring this Madina complex of streets & markets.We had a guide front & back as it is so easy to get lost. We observed others trying to extricate themselves from this maze using an APP on their phone without success.",
          "Fascinating, labyrinthine medina - the oldest if Morocco, and also home to the world\u2019s oldest university, as well as homes, shops, and restaurants of all sorts. Although I never felt unsafe here, you will be wise to carry only the money/valuables you need, and keep your bags",
          "If you go into the Medina, best have a guide, its a bit of a warren and you can easily get lost. Lots to see and smell, well worth the time",
          "Stopped in fes before starting my Sahara tour ending in marrakech. We opted for a guided tour from Airbnb experiences and I'm glad we did. You can easily get lost in this maze called the medina. You'll find things here that you won't find in marrakech so if you can buy",
          "We went here a couple days ago. This medina was full of great shops selling all kinds of stuff. I'd recommend the argon oil products. The people were really friendly. Many/most spoke English.",
          "The cultural experience of the M\u00e9dina left we wanting more! The food and culture of the M\u00e9dina gives you a first hand taste and experience of the richness ancient traditions in our modern day! I will return time and again.",
          "This was a lot of fun. It\u2019s exactly what you would expect. So many streets, very easy to get lost. Use Google maps to help, though it can still be tricky! Don\u2019t recommend it at night. We ate late in the Medina one night and the two entrances we used were blocked off as they",

          "Four days visit in Fes . Fascinated and colorful vibrant ancient city still exists today in our modern world !",
          "This is a great place to experience. We visited on a Friday so there were some shops not open which made it a little less crowded. There was still a lot of people around and it is a great place to visit. I would recommend a guide as it can be deceptive and there are SO many",
          "I decided to come to Fes and wanted to visit the Madina. Its one dirty S#@t hole full of scammers and people telling yes this was and leading you in the wrong direction, i got a bit lost one night as google maps is not the greatest for navergating in the Madina and before i knew",

If I had it to do over again, I would hire an experienced guide who would take",

          "It was very cool to see the tannery, to watch people workin inside colors it was a wonderful place,it's a historic place and more touristic",
          "Wow. That is how I would describe the Fez M\u00e9dina. A bit like traveling back in time. I\u2019m really glad we had a local guide to help us navigate the over 9,000 narrow pathways. I particularly loved people watching, especially the traditional market area where people were selling",
          "A bustling market with pretty much anything you could want to buy. Enjoyed walking through and made a few fun purchases.",
          "The medina in Fez is well set out, grouping things together in logical order. So that you have the tannery, metalwork, carpets, food etc grouped together rather than a random display. It is a feast for the eyes to walk through the lanes and watch the inhabitants of Fez go about",
          "Fes medina is beautiful but full of scams that leave a privileged person feeling pretty silly at best, bad about colonialism at worst. From the guys selling scarves made in China like they have on Canal Street in NY for 8$ and telling you they are 350 dirham (35$) and (fake)",
          "Wild and busy medina! Without a guide, we would have surely gotten lost. The streets are narrow and turn and it is very easy to lose your sense of direction. The shops were pretty much all the same. Leather, Silver, pottery. That is pretty much it. The hawkers followed us",
          "We are adventurous travelers and were skeptical about the advice not to walk around the medina alone, but it truly is a labyrinth. You can easily walk a few blocks from your hotel, but go for more than five minutes and you will get lost. Moroccans are extremely friendly and will",
          "Medina of Fez has an intricate Alleys and Labyrinths that you will get lost easily, if you're not guided by a local Tour Guide. Some alleys leads to a main road or smaller but distant alleys that takes you to a different place such as a market, food stalls, leather tanneries",
          "To get the most out of this experience you\u2019ll need a guide. We weren\u2019t in a group so arranged a local private guide which was fantastic because we were able to tailor our adventure to suit our pace. Plus the guides know the hidden gems. Oh yes it\u2019s likely that there\u2019s a bit of",
          "Love Fez - it\u2019s a charming rambling place with authenticity oozing out of every alley you pass. Very little hassle, many great options for food and the tanneries are well worth the trip. Beats Marrakesh on every front if you are looking to experience Morocco",
          "Like most M\u00e9dinas it is very easy to get lost here. Needless to say lots of people willing to tell you which way to go for a fee. If no pay then get ready to be sent the wrong way \ud83d\ude03 Loads of stalls with all the usual brick a brick on offer.",
          "Very nice M\u00e9dina and lots to see and do. Like all M\u00e9dina\u2019s do your bidding especially for spices. No your pricing and grams. They do not listen and pour more then needed and overcharge. Great restaurants around to pick from. I would recommend doing your shopping in Fez compared",
          "Old medina in Fes swallow you back in time. let yourself lost in this maze of narrow alleys and discover the rich history. make sure to visit Qairawan mosque and university and stop be close Tannery (don't buy leather products from stores on top of the tannery, very crazy",

          "Loved the M\u00e9dina but you have to be willing to get lost and just enjoy the experience. If not - be sure to get a reputable guide. We recommend Jamal - also recommended by Trip Advisor.",
          "We stayed two nights in Fes and it was great! I think two nights are enough if your main aim is to cover the medina. However, if you want to visit the new city then maybe you should add a day to that. Fes is rich with culture and bustling with street vendors. There are so many",
          "There are 9000 \"streets\" meaning walkways in medina and none take you where you want to go. However, every manor child who can see you trying to use google maps (which is worthless) will come to your assistance(at a price). Use them or not? Once they make contact if you go in",
          "The Medina of Fez is amazing. We found it to be far more calmer and cleaner compared to the Medina of Marrakesh due to the lack of motorbikes and bicycles since the Medina of Fez is adhering to stricter rules as a UNESCO heritage site. There are several renovated and restored",
          "This amazing M\u00e9dina should be seen with a competent guide. The narrow streets and the spiderwebbed layout make this an impossible place to visit by oneself. The cacophonous atmosphere, the tumultuous crowds and the visual display make this a worthwhile visit. Again, not for the",
          "A busy thriving place to visit, made more pleasurable by the lack of traffic in the narrow streets. The street map isn't very useful as not many names in existence, so in ways, if you want to go somewhere specific you do need a guide. There are plenty of locals who will 'guide'",
          "Medina and souks of Fes is a must see sight. It's a cob web. Enjoy the food, culture, tannaries, riads",
          "My goodness. Thank God we had a tour guide with us otherwise we would have gotten lost. Alley ways are small & intertwined. Lots & lots to buy from fruit & veggies to shoes to lovely lady and. Be careful of pick pockets so make sure you have items secured & be careful when",
          "I give it 5 stars for being the most interesting place I've seen. I give it 1 star for cleanliness. Much of it is filthy. Cats everywhere, garbage not picked up, wet slippery passageways, flies on raw meat and the shop owner fanning them away etc. I'm on a tour and one lady had",

          "We had the opportunity to visit this place and the overall experience was very good. The people appeared to be friendly. You can get lost very easily in the Medina it has hundreds and hundreds of alleys that a person can easily get lost if you don't pay attention. Some parts",
          "A bubbly old Medina full of life in the evenings till early hours of the morning! Narrow merchants streets full of merchants selling all kinds of goods. Main attraction was the cleaning and dying of animal skins in natural ways (apart from the stringent smell!).",
          "All the fun of the Marrakech medina without the motor scooters. Much calmer. Less hassle from tours too.",
          "We visited all there was to visit while in Fes but unless you do excursions, the Medina mostly what there us to see. We ventured outside to see the Jewish district and walked around the palace gardens and parks but it was not worth it. The Medina is really large. The Tanneries",
          "A noisy place, far from Asilah's medina tranquillity. Generally great architecture and monuments, but hactic and dirty. Must be seen, but can't call it pleasant.",
          "The medina of Fes is huge! And you will most likely loose track of time and route in there, but that's alright. Don't look to lost though, because young men always want to show you the way and then expect money for it. You can navigate quite good with google maps or something",
          "Wish we had more time to have seen more of Fez, as we were mainly in the main market area all the time and I am sure there was a lot more to see. Lovely shopping opportunities, stunning Riads, excellent food. Meandering through all the lanes, one never knows what is around the",
          "Our hotel is in the heart of Media and we were targeted by locals as soon as we stepped outside the front door. They tend to say \u2018the road is closed\u2019 to make you turnaround (some do this more cleverly where it does seem the road is a dead end, some will do it on the Main Street",
          "Absolutely amazing this is the largest Medina in the world with between 9-12000 streets and alley ways. It is like you have stepped back in time with its ancient buildings . You should take a guide even the guide I had got lost.No cars only donkeys for transport as the streets",

          "Where do I start? This is not a four star hotel!!! We were originally placed in a recently painted room with strong fumes. Upon complaining, our next option had a broken door jamb lock. Third attempt, with intervention by an older woman, moved us to a \u2018suite\u2019. The \u2018suite\u2019:",

          "Fez medina is just an over load on the mind with its narrow streets, amazing sight/smell,and crazy people. To really see this place l would highly recommend seeking out a good guide. I paid for a half day tour for about \u00a360.00 from a morrocan tour company, the guide was helpful",
          "How to put it? I usually like people, their culture and their ways of life. I prefer to live the streets of a city than its museums. But in Fez it was the first time in the world (and I have been in a few countries all around the world already) that I got really annoyed by",
          "Awesome and so informative- we loved it! A guide helps you to see all amazing things that Fez offers her visitors! In our opinion the best city of Morocco with no traffic and very clean and super friendly people! Don\u2019t miss out this nice city!",
          "Small roads. Lots of alleys. Shops gathered by what they sell, historical traditions in tanning and copper and food, walking through the Medina was amazing. We had a guide, which I was thankful for for two reasons. We didn\u2019t get lost and we got some local information . And 2 the",
          "Get a guide. Then enjoy. Take your time, talk to the vendors. They are lovely. Ask questions, they love giving feed back. Smile, as they don\u2019t smile much. Eye opener for the kids of today. Take them. Best experience you could give them. Grab some herbs, from the locals. They are",
          "We came to fes and stay there for three daysthe day tour with Hanan and she was an excellent guide! It was about five-six hours, taking us to a ceramics factory, the tannieries, around the Medina include the madrasas and other touristic locations. She also took us to the markers",

          "Even though the medina has its own magic and it is an experience, most of the locals are trying to manipulate the tourists by trying to get them more lost in the medina. This is one of the oldest medinas in the world with over 9000 narrow streets. We were walking during night",
          "The locals boast coming from the largest old city in north Africa. The lovely narrow souq offers a unique and authentic feel to Morocco.",
          "What an experience to visit such a maze. Make sure you have a guide or you will get lost. So many different merchants (seafood, spices, meat, fruits, clothes, leather, etc). Watch out however if you go to the carpet shop: they pressure you into buying a carpet.",

I tired of the little &$@%*#s who kept telling me \u201cthis street is closed\u201d, \u201cthis street is for Muslims only\u201d. Do people believe this? Do you run them off? There is absolutely NO reason to visit Fes. Read about it",
          "I have really complicated feelings about the Fez Medina. The Medina itself is a wonder to behold. Fez has some of the most beautiful interior design that I have ever seen. There are an abundance of goods to buy. The hustle and bustle of the streets is very exciting. However..",
          "Very interesting place, we took a guide for 3.5 hours and saw so much, my teenager was happier with that and we did learn a lot too. Every one seemed quite friendly to tourists, and no hassle a quick jo thank you and we were left alone. Amazing labyrinth of streets and shops",
          "Throw yourselves into the maelstrom that is the Medina. Beware of the taxis of the Medina (donkeys)! Beware of pushy young men who want to \"help\". Most of all, though, beware of being TOO timid. This is a great place to explore.",

          "The Medina of Fez is one of my favorite places I have ever visited. Once you step through those gates, you feel as if transported back in time. We stayed in the Medina of Fez, near Batha, with a host family for 4 nights and it was such an amazing experience. Make sure to not",
          "Our Cosmos tour took us on a guided tour of the Medina and it is like a rabbits warren with narrow streets and is very easy to get lost. We found the meat shops and the spice shops the most interesting and the leather factory is something like out of a Raiders of The Lost Ark",
          "If you go to Morocco, you must go to Fez! The Medina IS Fez. I loved everything here. Exploring everywhere. The tannery,carpetmaking, the Jewish Quarter, the Wood Museum, the Blue Gate, the Other Gate, the Shopping, yes, the Shopping...need I go on? Read my reviews on",
          "Having thoroughly enjoyed my first few days in Morocco, I had hoped that Fes would be another pleasant experience. The Riad we booked was awesome. Our guide was also great. But the medina itself? Nope, not particularly enjoyable. Full of con and scam artists waiting to fleece",
          "Old meet new the new city of fez with its cleen tree lined streets has a very osmopolitan feel. Big stores and newer hotels a great place to stop for a day or to and pick up thing if you need before continuing on your trip around Morrocco. The royal palace here is hudge with",
          "Since Fes is the craft capital of Morocco you can see everything here! The tannery, embroidery, dress making, carpets, making the traditional bronze pots, and dying clothes. The streets are narrow and bustling with donkeys and people. I would recommend a reputed guide to really",
          "We visited in May with a tour group. We had a guide that took us through the winding streets in the Medina. We were shown a very large Tannery which produced some top notch leather goods. A little pushy to make sales, just know your prices and don't feel obligated. FEZ leather",
          "What a cool way to be taken back in time! The old city is full of culture and character. Great for photography and a good time. You'll get lost, but that's part of the experience. Embrace it. We have an eighteenth month old that we toured the Medina with. It was a bit tough",
          "Our advice is take a 3 hour tour if it\u2019s your first visit to a Medina. This gives some framework to how it goes together - we were not excited about just wandering and getting lost, and after this we were confident to go exploring on our own. Fez Medina isn\u2019t that huge and has a",
          "Fez Medina is a labyrinth of narrow, dirty and dark passages connecting houses built in 12th century. The exterior is old and ugly, bt the interiors are incredible with very nicely decorated carvings.",
          "You climb up a few flights of stairs to get to the terrace and view the activity below and the site itself. You get an explanation from the local guide and you see people working like in the old days in this UNESCO site. It is very photogenic and interesting. They work skins of",

          "Our bus pulled to an overlook where we could look down on the walled city of Fes and the largest medieval Medina in the world. We would soon be experiencing the cacophony of vendors and shopkeepers in the narrow streets and alley's that add to the confusion. I could never",
          "In the medina we had a local guide, otherwise we would definitely get lost :) Anyway, you must visit and explore this city.",
          "The medina in Fes is a magical experience. The small narrow roads and markets are in abundance. You can find anything you would need from jewelry, gold, handmade clothing, pots, scarves, spices and more. It is quite an experience. When in the medina be sure to go to the",
          "Fes is like you turn time-machine 500 years back From modern part of Fes you come directly to past. You must take at least 5 hours and good local guide. You like to see famous tenneries? Men still work in tradizional way. You like to see the oldest universe in westeren world?",
          "My first bit of advise is to arrange a guide to focus on the artisans (leather, metal, silk, embroidery, etc.) that are scattered throughout the Medina while taking in all of the history around you. After that, exploring on your own is fun but be prepared to get lost and cell",
          "There are no street signs in the Medina of Fes, so getting lost is almost a given. So is the search for smaller denominations of money. Make sure you have smaller notes, because friendly locals will help you find your way back to your Riad, but they also expect to be",
          "A pretty area tainted by locals trying to scam. Don\u2019t ask/accept directions as they will insist on a tip. Whereas the souk of Marrakesh is easy to navigate this souk is difficult and intimidating, would recommend a guided tour to learn about the history.",
          "The Medina is why you come to Fes. It doesnt dissappoint.one of the more interesting places in Morocco.",
          "A labyrinth of alleys and laneways filled to the brim with shops selling everything possible. Loved the colours and sounds of everyday life such a must see place in Morocco",
          "Navigated the narrow streets. Went to the mosaic factory, the carpet \"factory\" with hand made rugs and the leather tannery.",
          "Everywhere I go in Morocco I end up asking \u00ab so is this the best medina? \u00bb! I can confidently say that Fes is one of them if not the best! Absolutely beautiful ! Authentic and clean. What is really amazing and unique is the silence!! The only medina with no cars or scooters. You",
          "With apparently over 9,000 alleys and 40,000 dead ends, how does one not love this medina? The endless possibilities are just awesome. And the souks in the medina have no equal. They are noisy, uniquely perfumed, frantic, and definitely chaotic. Like no other, it is just one",
          "The medina of Fes with almost 1100 tiny walking only streets is a medieval tangle. There are virtually no street signs, so a guide is absolutely essential to get the most from the medina. The medina is home to a UNESCO world heritage site, the leather tanneries of Fes. For those",
          "Lots of cool things to see and experience in the medina. But many people and confusion not too mention to few signs so hire a local guide through your hotel to make the most out of your experience. Even if you don't want to shop, the various heritage sites within the medina",
          "We finished our stay with 2 days planned in Fez. We had to leave ealier than expected, people was so agressive to get money all the time. What a pity when we have met some kind and caring people all along our trip. I had to mention that I have visited various cities in different",
          "We spent the better part of an afternoon walking through the largest market place in Morocco. The lanes are very narrow and feature artisans of many crafts, food staples, spices, etc. We also saw pottery makers, a tannery, herbalist production, weavers and carpetmakers, ornate",
          "Chaotic, noisy and busy and so easy to get lost especially in the souks...we loved exploring the Medina. Guaranteed to get lost, but that part of the fun. So much to see, and so many narrow alleyways to explore. We did hire a guide for a morning to get us orientated, but then",
          "...and it includes the tannery (do NOT decline the sprig of mint). It exposes the issue of medinas, which is that there is a lot of sameness, and a lot of them are taken over by shops, but still, you don't want to miss it.",
          "just get lost, even if you have a trail your following and you will stumble upon the weirdest streets, buildings and alleys. its beautiful to just stroll around",
          "One of the best Medinas amongst the rest in Morocco. Be sure to get your Tagine pots here, the origins where it begun. Two long stretches of main alleys filled with stalls after stalls and options aplenty. You\u2019ll be stocked to know all you need is here. Very colourful, vibrant",
          "A unique experience, the M\u00e9dina is hectic and noisy, with the local children playing amid the tourists and the local merchants! Makes you feel that you were dropped in a medieval town",
          "A reason to visit fez. A place we haven't found somewhere else and it is very interesting to see the process of painting.",
          "The medina of Fes is big and rightly famous. Small streets across the medina, difficult to orient as no street names. Overall, very exotic, impressive and worth the trip. But you must have a stable stomach if the sometimes penetrating odors.",
          "What fun. I would only do this with a guide. Chaos. Lots of vendors hawking everything and the maze is impenetrable",
          "You need to have a strong stomach due to the smell, but if you want great photographs, find a guide that can get you into the vat area and get close to the workers. The shops around the vats provide for some great photography as well--lined up shoes, bags.",
          "Fez has a separated Old town and New town, preserving the heritage of the Medina. The medina is typical but accommodation can vary markedly",
          "Our tour guide led us through narrow passage after narrow passage through Medina of Fes, and it was quite an eye-opening experience! It's hard to imagine how people keep track of the twists and turns throughout, but there is so much in this cramped but fascinating place. We saw",
          "Thank goodness we had an experienced guide to take us through the Medina especially the souks. Colors and scents were awesome as were the many foods we tasted.",
          "Love Fes... coolest place I've ever been. Tannery, carpets, pottery, people are lovely! Felt safe and welcome at all times!",
          "Everybody suggested that is good to have a guide if you do not want to lost yourself. But the Medina itself has good signs, so it is possible to visit it by yourself. Just a suggestion...star at upper part-Blue gates",
          "It is a city that people still live a life that was hundreds of years ago. The city itself is packed with thousands of narrow roads. You do need a guide because you'll get lost in the city (thought I did not try but I don't think GPS work there). They use donkeys as means of",
          "A tough impact in many ways and challenging to navigate but definitely lively a real! An experience that can't be missed on both human and cultural side. Each and every city/village in Morocco have a Medina or some sort of but in our experience Fes' Medina was absolutely 'the",
          "Historic with a million things to see and buy. Donkeys as transportation for goods, and live chickens that they prepare in front of you--if you wish. Camel brains to eat. And anything to buy. What could be bad?",
          "This is a must see, but take a guide. The area is very tight and there are no discernible exits to be found. The market is crowded and there are donkeys passing by regularly. It is a beautiful way to see how people buy their food and other products. The people are polite",
          "The medina certainly lived up to my expectations, a jumble of shops selling everything - colours, noise, people, alleyways,... just what I thought it would be.Love the leather dying area. Had lunch in a tourist restaurant, which was fine but not typical. We went with a guide,",
          "The Fez/Fes medina is an absolute labyrinth of a place, apparently designed to completely confuse any enemy who entered. Alleys are very narrow, some are dark and only one person wide. They were thronged with locals and tourists with areas specialising in things like bronze,",
          "Went here and loved it! The tannery is so cool (smelly but cool) and so many things has to see. Please watch your phones/wallet etc. We had 2 ladies in our group get their phones stolen ( they were careless but still). One was returned within minutes by an undercover police",
          "It would take a lifetime to explore all the alleys, shops, herboristes, to look at the food available, and to people-watch.",
          "Very interesting place, a maze of little streets with amazing shops. Very narrow so you need to dodge fully laden carts, donkey but jumping out of the way to shops. However most impressive is the view of the leather dying pools and manufacture of fabric from agave plants.",
          "We went with a tour guide who knew the entire M\u00e9dina. It was really winding roads and sold everything one can buy. There was even a mosque inside. Unsure if I would have gone inside without our guide but got to see carpets and tanneries etc.",
          "typical bustling and chaotic place. Only concern is the constant bikers speeding through the narrow alleys with a loud noise, and danger of being run over",
          "The entire Medina is fascinating. Time stands still. Every sense is on high alert, especially sight, smell and taste. The Medina is very busy and full of energy. Watch out for scammers and for junk posing as authentic Moroccan artifacts. Always haggle low and just walk away.",
          "and obviously everyone should go. So much to see! Amazing way of life with great hustle and bustle. Easy to get lost in the 9000 alleys.",
          "This is a massive place and should be seen from above to appreciate its size before descending into the old city and the souk. And, you should have a guide as it is that massive and confusing with twists and turns throughout. You will see everything imaginable for sale or",
          "Fez medina is a fascinating place with labyrinths, souks and people. There is a tiny place in the medina close to the Riad Taha where an old couple prepare the most tasty soup Harrira in he evening. you can see that sometimes people queue up to have a bowl of soup served with",
          "What history! What amazing, tiny alley ways into a wonder of sights, smells and sounds. Step back in time. Be on guard though!",
          "The maze was Amazing! Must have a guide with you otherwise you will be lost in the maze. Bargain for the goods start off with half off with what they ask for at least",
          "We spent about five hours in the Medina and covered very little of it. There is so much to see I think if you like markets then you could easily spend a few days wondering around. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "It was my 3rd visit to Fes. First time wasnt to good experience as i got lost in narrow lanes of huge old city late evening, and some guys wanted to show me the way out for money which really makes me angry, but i have no other option than to agree...since then i visited 2nd",
          "Medina of Fez was one of my favorite highlights of our Morocco trip. The sights, smells, and people were amazing. Our guide was phenomenal - Kamal - who was arranged through Morocco Dreams Tours.",
          "My friend and I were followed and harresssed by local men in the medina on twice in a few hours. I have no idea what they wanted and when they got agitated we were worried that they would be violent. I have heard from other female travelers that this is common in fes but that",
          "we enjoyed great time in Fes it's a beautiful city with small street, it's laether city, but it's difecult to find your hotel if you don't call the owners",
          "Another city, another fascinating Medina. Because it is steep, it's best to start from the top and work your way down. Great items and photo ops",
          "It is pretty hard to find your way in the medina of Fes, but it is a beautiful Medina with all the shops you can think of. And especially the tanneries are amazing!",
          "Fez is the most authentic city among Casablanca and Marrakesh. The city is a maze and you will probably need some sort of guide to get one place or another, as there are no street names. Local kids will guide you for a nominal sum (which you might wish to negotiate before",
          "Quite a experience. The smell is quite strong, but the whole picture is great, looking at people working the things you see on the souk and the techniques used to paint the leathers with different ingredients is culture per se.",
          "Opposite to Marrakesh, in Medina of Fez there are no scooters and motorcycles, so it is easier to walk. Buy yourself a 10 euro morrocan sim card with 10 GB and put it in your smartphone (we took one extra just for it) and follow the google map. You will not get lost and you will",
          "Probably one of the best I enjoyed. So many sectors to look for spots of interest. A great feadt for the eyes.",
          "Still thriving after 1000 years, the ancient city of Fez will take you back in time to the hussel and bussel of a different era. There are many spots to explore and one can easily get lost so definitely hire a local guide. There are mosques, souks, bakeries and all to see.",
          "This impressive labyrinth full of dead end streets, alleyways and shops will provide the visitor a memorable experience of what life must have been centuries ago. Since the buildings are built so closely together, most of the time you\u2019ll feel quite fresh even in the hottest",
          "If possible, take your time to walk the Medina and appreciate the sites, smells, noise, and energy. Each Medina has its own personality and the Medin in Fez is no different.",
          "If you are looking for a different experience,please go inside the M\u00e9dina,you are going to see the real life of maroc and his people.",
          "We found the Fes Medina to be somewhat less chaotic than the one in Marrakech. Generally speaking, there are items of higher quality available as well (at least this was my impression). Highly recommend that if you are going to be doing some serious shopping -- bronze lamps,",
          "Great place to visit but the hassling by people trying to sell you stuff is non stop and makes the experience a little daunting",
          "Like all medinas, you'll wander down alleyways and find stores selling anything and everything. You'll go back and forth on price and see and smell some wonderful sights and smells.",
          "For those who have traveled to the Marrakesh Medina, the Fes Medina is more organized and less chance of getting lost. We hired a guide to a 3 hour morning tour and were given good insight in the the cultural, family and business aspects of the Medina. I would recommend a",

          "The M\u00e9dina of Fes (old city) was so interesting. I come from Canada, where, if we are lucky, a building is 200 years old. The Riad we stayed in was built in 1135AD. The smells and sounds in Medina were exciting. Would recommend to everyone who are mobile. The streets are",
          "Unfortunately we went on a Friday, and most places were closed. It was interesting to walk around just to see the architecture of the alley ways and what an incredible labyrinth it is. Some lanes were so tight any one over weight would not have been able to fit through some of",
          "By far, the most amazing medina in Morocco. It has everything (including a camel's head posted at one butcher shop to show it is fresh!). But be warned, despite what the guide books may say, it is impossible to get around without a guide. And even if you have a photographic",
          "I think you would need a guide to take around in the maze. Unless you speak the local language and a map handy. Too many touts will follow you everywhere asking to buy their products. But the tannery is a must see.",
          "We got a guide for the medina to make sure we found the largest souks. He showed us the copper workers, wood workers, leather works, mosques and neighborhoods. It was worth the money to see it all or nearly all. The leather works were as promised. We could have stayed all day",
          "Of all the cities that were visited, this Medina is the best of all of them. Long winding roads that seemingly lead to nowhere is what makes this Medina a must see. First place to visit in Fes.",
          "It was like stepping back in Moroccan history. The Medina was so much fun, the sellers were friendly. I would go back in a heartbeat. We ate at a restaurant named The Clock, it was delightful with authentic Moroccan food.",
          "BE AWARE! We bought some ceramics in Fez Medina. Some of it had 3 signs, some two (with 3 signs considered to be of a better quality). Back in Germany we tested it with leadcheck. All ceramics we tested contain lead. In the photo attached pink means containing lead.",
          "We toured the Medina with a \"professor\" who ended up being very friendly and informative. This was booked through the front desk of our Riad. We would highly recommend using such a guide... However... Some of the stops (such as the tannery and pottery school) may have exorbitant",

          "This location is a UNESCO world heritage site. To me going here was an amazing experience, yes it has its share of tourist stuff and persistent but polte street salesman but you are also walking through the heart of a town within a city. You should engage a guide just to keep",

          "First, do not even think about exploring the Fes Medina without a guide. You will get lost. It's an amazing experience exploring the small twisting alleys and byways. There are souks devoted to all sorts of trades and handcrafts. It's worth about 4 hours minimum, probably",

          "If you have never been to a Medina or a market if this kind like in Mexico etc then worth a visit. Seeing a camel butcher, the tannery etc and narrow streets. Do it with a guide and go early wear shoes that are easy to walk with, but also you don\u2019t mind getting blood, poop etc",

That\u2019s all I have to say, this place is where my heart is at, walking around the 14th (300 hectors) and 18th centuries Medina\u2019s was something else, very different but very beautiful.

A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish ethnicity, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. During his reign, Saladin has been described as the de facto Caliph of Islam and at the height of his power, his empire included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa.\nHe was originally sent to Fatimid Egypt in 1164 alongside his uncle Shirkuh, a general of the Zengid army, on the orders of their lord Nur ad-Din to help restore Shawar as vizier of the teenage Fatimid caliph al-Adid. A power struggle ensued between Shirkuh and Shawar after the latter was reinstated. Saladin, meanwhile, climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government by virtue of his military successes against Crusader assaults against its territory and his personal closeness to al-Adid. After Shawar was assassinated and Shirkuh died in 1169, al-Adid appointed Saladin vizier, a rare nomination of a Sunni Muslim to such an important position in the Isma'ili Shia caliphate. During his tenure as vizier, Saladin began to undermine the Fatimid establishment and, following al-Adid's death in 1171, he abolished the Fatimid Caliphate and realigned the country's allegiance with the Sunni, Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate.\nIn the following years, he led forays against the Crusaders in Palestine, commissioned the successful conquest of Yemen, and staved off pro-Fatimid rebellions in Upper Egypt. Not long after Nur ad-Din's death in 1174, Saladin launched his conquest of Syria, peacefully entering Damascus at the request of its governor. By mid-1175, Saladin had conquered Hama and Homs, inviting the animosity of other Zengid lords, the official rulers of Syria's various regions. Soon after, he defeated the Zengid army at the Battle of the Horns of Hama and was thereafter proclaimed the \"Sultan of Egypt and Syria\" by the Abbasid caliph al-Mustadi. Saladin made further conquests in northern Syria and Jazira, escaping two attempts on his life by Assassins, before returning to Egypt in 1177 to address issues there. By 1182, Saladin had completed the conquest of Muslim Syria after capturing Aleppo, but ultimately failed to take over the Zengid stronghold of Mosul.Under Saladin's command, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at the decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187, and thereafter wrested control of Palestine\u2014including the city of Jerusalem\u2014from the Crusaders, who had conquered the area 88 years earlier. Although the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem continued to exist until the late 13th century, its defeat at Hattin marked a turning point in its conflict with the Muslim powers of the region. Saladin died in Damascus in 1193, having given away much of his personal wealth to his subjects. He is buried in a mausoleum adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque. Saladin has become a prominent figure in Muslim, Arab, Turkish and Kurdish culture, and he has often been described as being the most famous Kurd in history.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSaladin was born in Tikrit in modern-day Iraq. His personal name was \"Yusuf\"; \"Salah ad-Din\" is a laqab, an honorific epithet, meaning \"Righteousness of the Faith\". His family was most likely of Kurdish ancestry, and had originated from the village of Ajdanakan near the city of Dvin in central Armenia. The Rawadiya tribe he hailed from had been partially assimilated into the Arabic-speaking world by this time. In 1132, the defeated army of Imad ad-Din Zengi, the ruler of Mosul, found their retreat blocked by the Tigris River opposite the fortress of Tikrit, where Saladin's father, Najm ad-Din Ayyub served as the warden. Ayyub provided ferries for the army and gave them refuge in Tikrit. Mujahed al-Din Bihruz, a former Greek slave who had been appointed as the military governor of northern Mesopotamia for his service to the Seljuks, reprimanded Ayyub for giving Zengi refuge and in 1137 banished Ayyub from Tikrit after his brother Asad al-Din Shirkuh killed a friend of Bihruz. According to Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, Saladin was born on the same night that his family left Tikrit. In 1139, Ayyub and his family moved to Mosul, where Imad ad-Din Zengi acknowledged his debt and appointed Ayyub commander of his fortress in Baalbek. After the death of Zengi in 1146, his son, Nur ad-Din, became the regent of Aleppo and the leader of the Zengids.Saladin, who now lived in Damascus, was reported to have a particular fondness for the city, but information on his early childhood is scarce. About education, Saladin wrote \"children are brought up in the way in which their elders were brought up\". According to his biographers, Anne-Marie Edd\u00e9 and al-Wahrani, Saladin was able to answer questions on Euclid, the Almagest, arithmetic, and law, but this was an academic ideal and it was study of the Qur'an and the \"sciences of religion\" that linked him to his contemporaries. Several sources claim that during his studies he was more interested in religious studies than joining the military. Another factor which may have affected his interest in religion was that, during the First Crusade, Jerusalem was taken by the Christians. In addition to Islam, Saladin had a knowledge of the genealogies, biographies, and histories of the Arabs, as well as the bloodlines of Arabian horses. More significantly, he knew the Hamasah of Abu Tammam by heart. He spoke Kurdish and Arabic.\n\n\n== Early expeditions ==\n\nSaladin's military career began under the tutelage of his uncle Asad al-Din Shirkuh, a prominent military commander under Nur ad-Din, the Zengid emir of Damascus and Aleppo and the most influential teacher of Saladin. In 1163, the vizier to the Fatimid caliph al-Adid, Shawar, had been driven out of Egypt by his rival Dirgham, a member of the powerful Banu Ruzzaik tribe. He asked for military backing from Nur ad-Din, who complied and, in 1164, sent Shirkuh to aid Shawar in his expedition against Dirgham. Saladin, at age 26, went along with them. After Shawar was successfully reinstated as vizier, he demanded that Shirkuh withdraw his army from Egypt for a sum of 30,000 gold dinars, but he refused, insisting it was Nur ad-Din's will that he remain. Saladin's role in this expedition was minor, and it is known that he was ordered by Shirkuh to collect stores from Bilbais prior to its siege by a combined force of Crusaders and Shawar's troops.After the sacking of Bilbais, the Crusader-Egyptian force and Shirkuh's army were to engage in the  Battle of al-Babein on the desert border of the Nile, just west of Giza. Saladin played a major role, commanding the right wing of the Zengid army, while a force of Kurds commanded the left, and Shirkuh was stationed in the center. Muslim sources at the time, however, put Saladin in the \"baggage of the centre\" with orders to lure the enemy into a trap by staging a feigned retreat. The Crusader force enjoyed early success against Shirkuh's troops, but the terrain was too steep and sandy for their horses, and commander Hugh of Caesarea was captured while attacking Saladin's unit. After scattered fighting in little valleys to the south of the main position, the Zengid central force returned to the offensive; Saladin joined in from the rear.The battle ended in a Zengid victory, and Saladin is credited with having helped Shirkuh in one of the \"most remarkable victories in recorded history\", according to Ibn al-Athir, although more of Shirkuh's men were killed and the battle is considered by most sources as not a total victory. Saladin and Shirkuh moved towards Alexandria where they were welcomed, given money, arms and provided a base. Faced by a superior Crusader-Egyptian force attempting to besiege the city, Shirkuh split his army. He and the bulk of his force withdrew from Alexandria, while Saladin was left with the task of guarding the city.\n\n\n== In Egypt ==\n\n\n=== Vizier of Egypt ===\n\nShirkuh was in a power struggle over Egypt with Shawar and Amalric I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, in which Shawar requested Amalric's assistance. In 1169, Shawar was reportedly assassinated by Saladin, and Shirkuh died later that year. Nur ad-Din chose a successor for Shirkuh, but al-Adid appointed Saladin to replace Shawar as vizier.The reasoning behind the Shia caliph al-Adid's selection of Saladin, a Sunni, varies. Ibn al-Athir claims that the caliph chose him after being told by his advisers that \"there is no one weaker or younger\" than Saladin, and \"not one of the emirs [commanders] obeyed him or served him\". However, according to this version, after some bargaining, he was eventually accepted by the majority of the emirs. Al-Adid's advisers were also suspected of promoting Saladin in an attempt to split the Syria-based Zengids. Al-Wahrani wrote that Saladin was selected because of the reputation of his family in their \"generosity and military prowess\". Imad ad-Din wrote that after the brief mourning period for Shirkuh, during which \"opinions differed\", the Zengid emirs decided upon Saladin and forced the caliph to \"invest him as vizier\". Although positions were complicated by rival Muslim leaders, the bulk of the Syrian commanders supported Saladin because of his role in the Egyptian expedition, in which he gained a record of military qualifications.Inaugurated as vizier on 26 March, Saladin repented \"wine-drinking and turned from frivolity to assume the dress of religion\", according to Arabic sources of the time. Having gained more power and independence than ever before in his career, he still faced the issue of ultimate loyalty between al-Adid and Nur ad-Din. Later in the year, a group of Egyptian soldiers and emirs attempted to assassinate Saladin, but having already known of their intentions thanks to his intelligence chief Ali ibn Safyan, he had the chief conspirator, Naji, Mu'tamin al-Khilafa\u2014the civilian controller of the Fatimid Palace\u2014arrested and killed. The day after, 50,000 Black African soldiers from the regiments of the Fatimid army opposed to Saladin's rule, along with a number of Egyptian emirs and commoners, staged a revolt. By 23 August, Saladin had decisively quelled the uprising, and never again had to face a military challenge from Cairo.Towards the end of 1169, Saladin, with reinforcements from Nur ad-Din, defeated a massive Crusader-Byzantine force near Damietta. Afterward, in the spring of 1170, Nur ad-Din sent Saladin's father to Egypt in compliance with Saladin's request, as well as encouragement from the Baghdad-based Abbasid caliph, al-Mustanjid, who aimed to pressure Saladin in deposing his rival caliph, al-Adid. Saladin himself had been strengthening his hold on Egypt and widening his support base there. He began granting his family members high-ranking positions in the region; he ordered the construction of a college for the Maliki branch of Sunni Islam in the city, as well as one for the Shafi'i denomination to which he belonged in al-Fustat.After establishing himself in Egypt, Saladin launched a campaign against the Crusaders, besieging Darum in 1170. Amalric withdrew his Templar garrison from Gaza to assist him in defending Darum, but Saladin evaded their force and captured Gaza in 1187. In 1191 Saladin destroyed the fortifications in Gaza build by King Baldwin III for the Knights Templar. It is unclear exactly when, but during that same year, he attacked and captured the Crusader castle of Eilat, built on an island off the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. It did not pose a threat to the passage of the Muslim navy, but could harass smaller parties of Muslim ships and Saladin decided to clear it from his path.\n\n\n=== Sultan of Egypt ===\n\nAccording to Imad ad-Din, Nur ad-Din wrote to Saladin in June 1171, telling him to reestablish the Abbasid caliphate in Egypt, which Saladin coordinated two months later after additional encouragement by Najm ad-Din al-Khabushani, the Shafi'i faqih, who vehemently opposed Shia rule in the country. Several Egyptian emirs were thus killed, but al-Adid was told that they were killed for rebelling against him. He then fell ill, or was poisoned according to one account. While ill, he asked Saladin to pay him a visit to request that he take care of his young children, but Saladin refused, fearing treachery against the Abbasids, and is said to have regretted his action after realizing what al-Adid had wanted. He died on 13 September, and five days later, the Abbasid khutba was pronounced in Cairo and al-Fustat, proclaiming al-Mustadi as caliph.On 25 September, Saladin left Cairo to take part in a joint attack on Kerak and Montreal, the desert castles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, with Nur ad-Din who would attack from Syria. Prior to arriving at Montreal, Saladin however withdrew back to Cairo as he received the reports that in his absence the Crusader leaders had increased their support to the traitors inside Egypt to attack Saladin from within and lessen his power especially the Fatimid who started plotting to restore their past glory. Because of this, Nur ad-Din went on alone.During the summer of 1173, a Nubian army along with a contingent of Armenian refugees were reported on the Egyptian border, preparing for a siege against Aswan. The emir of the city had requested Saladin's assistance and was given reinforcements under Turan-Shah, Saladin's brother. Consequently, the Nubians departed; but returned in 1173 and were again driven off. This time, Egyptian forces advanced from Aswan and captured the Nubian town of Ibrim. Saladin sent a gift to Nur ad-Din, who had been his friend and teacher, 60,000 dinars, \"wonderful manufactured goods\", some jewels, and an elephant. While transporting these goods to Damascus, Saladin took the opportunity to ravage the Crusader countryside. He did not press an attack against the desert castles, but attempted to drive out the Muslim Bedouins who lived in Crusader territory with the aim of depriving the Franks of guides.On 31 July 1173, Saladin's father Ayyub was wounded in a horse-riding accident, ultimately causing his death on 9 August. In 1174, Saladin sent Turan-Shah to conquer Yemen to allocate it and its port Aden to the territories of the Ayyubid Dynasty.\n\n\n== Conquest of Syria ==\n\n\n=== Conquest of Damascus ===\nIn the early summer of 1174, Nur ad-Din was mustering an army, sending summons to Mosul, Diyar Bakr, and the Jazira in an apparent preparation of attack against Saladin's Egypt. The Ayyubids held a council upon the revelation of these preparations to discuss the possible threat and Saladin collected his own troops outside Cairo. On 15 May, Nur ad-Din died after falling ill the previous week and his power was handed to his eleven-year-old son as-Salih Ismail al-Malik. His death left Saladin with political independence and in a letter to as-Salih, he promised to \"act as a sword\" against his enemies and referred to the death of his father as an \"earthquake shock\".In the wake of Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin faced a difficult decision; he could move his army against the Crusaders from Egypt or wait until invited by as-Salih in Syria to come to his aid and launch a war from there. He could also take it upon himself to annex Syria before it could possibly fall into the hands of a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master\u2014forbidden in the Islamic principles in which he believed\u2014could portray him as hypocritical, thus making him unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders. Saladin saw that in order to acquire Syria, he either needed an invitation from as-Salih, or to warn him that potential anarchy could give rise to danger from the Crusaders.When as-Salih was removed to Aleppo in August, Gumushtigin, the emir of the city and a captain of Nur ad-Din's veterans, assumed the guardianship over him. The emir prepared to unseat all his rivals in Syria and the Jazira, beginning with Damascus. In this emergency, the emir of Damascus appealed to Saif al-Din of Mosul (a cousin of Gumushtigin) for assistance against Aleppo, but he refused, forcing the Syrians to request the aid of Saladin, who complied. Saladin rode across the desert with 700 picked horsemen, passing through al-Kerak then reaching Bosra. According to his own account, was joined by \"emirs, soldiers, and Bedouins\u2014the emotions of their hearts to be seen on their faces.\" On 23 November, he arrived in Damascus amid general acclamation and rested at his father's old home there, until the gates of the Citadel of Damascus, whose commander Raihan initially refused to surrender, were opened to Saladin four days later, after a brief siege by his brother Tughtakin ibn Ayyub. He installed himself in the castle and received the homage and salutations of the inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Further conquests in Syria ===\n\nLeaving his brother Tughtakin ibn Ayyub as Governor of Damascus, Saladin proceeded to reduce other cities that had belonged to Nur al-Din, but were now practically independent. His army conquered Hama with relative ease, but avoided attacking Homs because of the strength of its citadel. Saladin moved north towards Aleppo, besieging it on 30 December after Gumushtigin refused to abdicate his throne. As-Salih, fearing capture by Saladin, came out of his palace and appealed to the inhabitants not to surrender him and the city to the invading force. One of Saladin's chroniclers claimed \"the people came under his spell\".Gumushtigin requested Rashid ad-Din Sinan, chief da'i of the Assassins of Syria, who were already at odds with Saladin since he replaced the Fatimids of Egypt, to assassinate Saladin in his camp. On 11 May 1175, a group of thirteen Assassins easily gained admission into Saladin's camp, but were detected immediately before they carried out their attack by Nasih al-Din Khumartekin of Abu Qubays. One was killed by one of Saladin's generals and the others were slain while trying to escape. To deter Saladin's progress, Raymond of Tripoli gathered his forces by Nahr al-Kabir, where they were well placed for an attack on Muslim territory. Saladin later moved toward Homs instead, but retreated after being told a relief force was being sent to the city by Saif al-Din.Meanwhile, Saladin's rivals in Syria and Jazira waged a propaganda war against him, claiming he had \"forgotten his own condition [servant of Nur ad-Din]\" and showed no gratitude for his old master by besieging his son, rising \"in rebellion against his Lord\". Saladin aimed to counter this propaganda by ending the siege, claiming that he was defending Islam from the Crusaders; his army returned to Hama to engage a Crusader force there. The Crusaders withdrew beforehand and Saladin proclaimed it \"a victory opening the gates of men's hearts\". Soon after, Saladin entered Homs and captured its citadel in March 1175, after stubborn resistance from its defenders.Saladin's successes alarmed Saif al-Din. As head of the Zengids, including Gumushtigin, he regarded Syria and Mesopotamia as his family estate and was angered when Saladin attempted to usurp his dynasty's holdings. Saif al-Din mustered a large army and dispatched it to Aleppo, whose defenders anxiously had awaited them. The combined forces of Mosul and Aleppo marched against Saladin in Hama. Heavily outnumbered, Saladin initially attempted to make terms with the Zengids by abandoning all conquests north of the Damascus province, but they refused, insisting he return to Egypt. Seeing that confrontation was unavoidable, Saladin prepared for battle, taking up a superior position at the Horns of Hama, hills by the gorge of the Orontes River. On 13 April 1175, the Zengid troops marched to attack his forces, but soon found themselves surrounded by Saladin's Ayyubid veterans, who crushed them. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Saladin, who pursued the Zengid fugitives to the gates of Aleppo, forcing as-Salih's advisers to recognize Saladin's control of the provinces of Damascus, Homs and Hama, as well as a number of towns outside Aleppo such as Ma'arat al-Numan.After his victory against the Zengids, Saladin proclaimed himself king and suppressed the name of as-Salih in Friday prayers and Islamic coinage. From then on, he ordered prayers in all the mosques of Syria and Egypt as the sovereign king and he issued at the Cairo mint gold coins bearing his official title\u2014al-Malik an-Nasir Yusuf Ayyub, ala ghaya \"the King Strong to Aid, Joseph son of Job; exalted be the standard.\" The Abbasid caliph in Baghdad graciously welcomed Saladin's assumption of power and declared him \"Sultan of Egypt and Syria\". The Battle of Hama did not end the contest for power between the Ayyubids and the Zengids, with the final confrontation occurring in the spring of 1176. Saladin had gathered massive reinforcements from Egypt while Saif al-Din was levying troops among the minor states of Diyarbakir and al-Jazira. When Saladin crossed the Orontes, leaving Hama, the sun was eclipsed. He viewed this as an omen, but he continued his march north. He reached the Sultan's Mound, roughly 25 km (16 mi) from Aleppo, where his forces encountered Saif al-Din's army. A hand-to-hand fight ensued and the Zengids managed to plow Saladin's left wing, driving it before him, when Saladin himself charged at the head of the Zengid guard. The Zengid forces panicked and most of Saif al-Din's officers ended up being killed or captured\u2014Saif al-Din narrowly escaped. The Zengid army's camp, horses, baggage, tents and stores were seized by the Ayyubids. The Zengid prisoners of war, however, were given gifts and freed. All of the booty from the Ayyubid victory was accorded to the army, Saladin not keeping anything himself.He continued towards Aleppo, which still closed its gates to him, halting before the city. On the way, his army took Buza'a, then captured Manbij. From there, they headed west to besiege the fortress of A'zaz on 15 May. Several days later, while Saladin was resting in one of his captain's tents, an Assassin rushed forward at him and struck at his head with a knife. The cap of his head armour was not penetrated and he managed to grip the Assassin's hand\u2014the dagger only slashing his gambeson\u2014and the assailant was soon killed. Saladin was unnerved at the attempt on his life, which he accused Gumushtugin and the Assassins of plotting, and so increased his efforts in the siege.A'zaz capitulated on 21 June, and Saladin then hurried his forces to Aleppo to punish Gumushtigin. His assaults were again resisted, but he managed to secure not only a truce, but a mutual alliance with Aleppo, in which Gumushtigin and as-Salih were allowed to continue their hold on the city and in return, they recognized Saladin as the sovereign over all of the dominions he conquered. The emirs of Mardin and Keyfa, the Muslim allies of Aleppo, also recognised Saladin as the King of Syria. When the treaty was concluded, the younger sister of as-Salih came to Saladin and requested the return of the Fortress of A'zaz; he complied and escorted her back to the gates of Aleppo with numerous presents.\n\n\n=== Campaign against the Assassins ===\n\nSaladin had by now agreed truces with his Zengid rivals and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (the latter occurred in the summer of 1175), but faced a threat from the Isma'ili sect known as the Assassins, led by Rashid ad-Din Sinan. Based in the an-Nusayriyah Mountains, they commanded nine fortresses, all built on high elevations. As soon as he dispatched the bulk of his troops to Egypt, Saladin led his army into the an-Nusayriyah range in August 1176. He retreated the same month, after laying waste to the countryside, but failing to conquer any of the forts. Most Muslim historians claim that Saladin's uncle, the governor of Hama, mediated a peace agreement between him and Sinan.Saladin had his guards supplied with link lights and had chalk and cinders strewed around his tent outside Masyaf\u2014which he was besieging\u2014to detect any footsteps by the Assassins. According to this version, one night Saladin's guards noticed a spark glowing down the hill of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents. Presently, Saladin awoke to find a figure leaving the tent. He saw that the lamps were displaced and beside his bed laid hot scones of the shape peculiar to the Assassins with a note at the top pinned by a poisoned dagger. The note threatened that he would be killed if he did not withdraw from his assault. Saladin gave a loud cry, exclaiming that Sinan himself was the figure that had left the tent.Another version claims that Saladin hastily withdrew his troops from Masyaf because they were urgently needed to fend off a Crusader force in the vicinity of Mount Lebanon. In reality, Saladin sought to form an alliance with Sinan and his Assassins, consequently depriving the Crusaders of a potent ally against him. Viewing the expulsion of the Crusaders as a mutual benefit and priority, Saladin and Sinan maintained cooperative relations afterwards, the latter dispatching contingents of his forces to bolster Saladin's army in a number of decisive subsequent battlefronts.\n\n\n== Return to Cairo and forays in Palestine ==\n\nAfter leaving the an-Nusayriyah Mountains, Saladin returned to Damascus and had his Syrian soldiers return home. He left Turan Shah in command of Syria and left for Egypt with only his personal followers, reaching Cairo on 22 September. Having been absent roughly two years, he had much to organize and supervise in Egypt, namely fortifying and reconstructing Cairo. The city walls were repaired and their extensions laid out, while the construction of the Cairo Citadel was commenced. The 280 feet (85 m) deep Bir Yusuf (\"Joseph's Well\") was built on Saladin's orders. The chief public work he commissioned outside of Cairo was the large bridge at Giza, which was intended to form an outwork of defense against a potential Moorish invasion.Saladin remained in Cairo supervising its improvements, building colleges such as the Madrasa of the Sword Makers and ordering the internal administration of the country. In November 1177, he set out upon a raid into Palestine; the Crusaders had recently forayed into the territory of Damascus, so Saladin saw the truce as no longer worth preserving. The Christians sent a large portion of their army to besiege the fortress of Harim north of Aleppo, so southern Palestine bore few defenders. Saladin found the situation ripe and marched to Ascalon, which he referred to as the \"Bride of Syria\". William of Tyre recorded that the Ayyubid army consisted of 26,000 soldiers, of which 8,000 were elite forces and 18,000 were black soldiers from Sudan. This army proceeded to raid the countryside, sack Ramla and Lod, and dispersed themselves as far as the Gates of Jerusalem.\n\n\n=== Battles and truce with Baldwin ===\nThe Ayyubids allowed Baldwin IV of Jerusalem to enter Ascalon with his Gaza-based Knights Templar without taking any precautions against a sudden attack. Although the Crusader force consisted of only 375 knights, Saladin hesitated to ambush them because of the presence of highly skilled generals. On 25 November, while the greater part of the Ayyubid army was absent, Saladin and his men were surprised near Ramla in the battle of Montgisard. Before they could form up, the Templar force hacked the Ayyubid army down. Initially, Saladin attempted to organize his men into battle order, but as his bodyguards were being killed, he saw that defeat was inevitable and so with a small remnant of his troops mounted a swift camel, riding all the way to the territories of Egypt.Not discouraged by his defeat at Tell Jezer, Saladin was prepared to fight the Crusaders once again. In the spring of 1178, he was encamped under the walls of Homs, and a few skirmishes occurred between his generals and the Crusader army. His forces in Hama won a victory over their enemy and brought the spoils, together with many prisoners of war, to Saladin who ordered the captives to be beheaded for \"plundering and laying waste the lands of the Faithful\". He spent the rest of the year in Syria without a confrontation with his enemies.\n\nSaladin's intelligence services reported to him that the Crusaders were planning a raid into Syria. He ordered one of his generals, Farrukh-Shah, to guard the Damascus frontier with a thousand of his men to watch for an attack, then to retire, avoiding battle, and to light warning beacons on the hills, after which Saladin would march out. In April 1179, the Crusaders led by King Baldwin expected no resistance and waited to launch a surprise attack on Muslim herders grazing their herds and flocks east of the Golan Heights. Baldwin advanced too rashly in pursuit of Farrukh-Shah's force, which was concentrated southeast of Quneitra and was subsequently defeated by the Ayyubids. With this victory, Saladin decided to call in more troops from Egypt; he requested al-Adil to dispatch 1,500 horsemen.In the summer of 1179, King Baldwin had set up an outpost on the road to Damascus and aimed to fortify a passage over the Jordan River, known as Jacob's Ford, that commanded the approach to the Banias plain (the plain was divided by the Muslims and the Christians). Saladin had offered 100,000 gold pieces to Baldwin to abandon the project, which was particularly offensive to the Muslims, but to no avail. He then resolved to destroy the fortress, called Chastellet and manned by the Templars, moving his headquarters to Banias. As the Crusaders hurried down to attack the Muslim forces, they fell into disorder, with the infantry falling behind. Despite early success, they pursued the Muslims far enough to become scattered, and Saladin took advantage by rallying his troops and charged at the Crusaders. The engagement ended in a decisive Ayyubid victory, and many high-ranking knights were captured. Saladin then moved to besiege the fortress, which fell on 30 August 1179.In the spring of 1180, while Saladin was in the area of Safad, anxious to commence a vigorous campaign against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, King Baldwin sent messengers to him with proposals of peace. Because droughts and bad harvests hampered his commissariat, Saladin agreed to a truce. Raymond of Tripoli denounced the truce but was compelled to accept after an Ayyubid raid on his territory in May and upon the appearance of Saladin's naval fleet off the port of Tartus.\n\n\n== Domestic affairs ==\nIn June 1180, Saladin hosted a reception for Nur al-Din Muhammad, the Artuqid emir of Keyfa, at Geuk Su, in which he presented him and his brother Abu Bakr with gifts, valued at over 100,000 dinars according to Imad al-Din. This was intended to cement an alliance with the Artuqids and to impress other emirs in Mesopotamia and Anatolia. Previously, Saladin offered to mediate relations between Nur al-Din and Kilij Arslan II\u2014the Seljuk sultan of R\u00fbm\u2014after the two came into conflict. The latter demanded that Nur al-Din return the lands given to him as a dowry for marrying his daughter when he received reports that she was being abused and used to gain Seljuk territory. Nur al-Din asked Saladin to mediate the issue, but Arslan refused.After Nur al-Din and Saladin met at Geuk Su, the top Seljuk emir, Ikhtiyar al-Din al-Hasan, confirmed Arslan's submission, after which an agreement was drawn up. Saladin was later enraged when he received a message from Arslan accusing Nur al-Din of more abuses against his daughter. He threatened to attack the city of Malatya, saying, \"it is two days march for me and I shall not dismount [my horse] until I am in the city.\" Alarmed at the threat, the Seljuks pushed for negotiations. Saladin felt that Arslan was correct to care for his daughter, but Nur al-Din had taken refuge with him, and therefore he could not betray his trust. It was finally agreed that Arslan's daughter would be sent away for a year and if Nur al-Din failed to comply, Saladin would move to abandon his support for him.Leaving Farrukh-Shah in charge of Syria, Saladin returned to Cairo at the beginning of 1181. According to Abu Shama, he intended to spend the fast of Ramadan in Egypt and then make the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in the summer. For an unknown reason he apparently changed his plans regarding the pilgrimage and was seen inspecting the Nile River banks in June. He was again embroiled with the Bedouin; he removed two-thirds of their fiefs to use as compensation for the fief-holders at Fayyum. The Bedouin were also accused of trading with the Crusaders and, consequently, their grain was confiscated and they were forced to migrate westward. Later, Ayyubid warships were waged against Bedouin river pirates, who were plundering the shores of Lake Tanis.In the summer of 1181, Saladin's former palace administrator Qara-Qush led a force to arrest Majd al-Din\u2014a former deputy of Turan-Shah in the Yemeni town of Zabid\u2014while he was entertaining Imad ad-Din at his estate in Cairo. Saladin's intimates accused Majd al-Din of misappropriating the revenues of Zabid, but Saladin himself believed there was no evidence to back the allegations. He had Majd al-Din released in return for a payment of 80,000 dinars. In addition, other sums were to be paid to Saladin's brothers al-Adil and Taj al-Muluk Buri. The controversial detainment of Majd al-Din was a part of the larger discontent associated with the aftermath of Turan-Shah's departure from Yemen. Although his deputies continued to send him revenues from the province, centralized authority was lacking and internal quarrel arose between Izz al-Din Uthman of Aden and Hittan of Zabid. Saladin wrote in a letter to al-Adil: \"this Yemen is a treasure house ... We conquered it, but up to this day we have had no return and no advantage from it. There have been only innumerable expenses, the sending out of troops ... and expectations which did not produce what was hoped for in the end.\"\n\n\n== Imperial expansions ==\n\n\n=== Conquest of Mesopotamian hinterland ===\n\nSaif al-Din had died earlier in June 1181 and his brother Izz al-Din inherited leadership of Mosul. On 4 December, the crown-prince of the Zengids, as-Salih, died in Aleppo. Prior to his death, he had his chief officers swear an oath of loyalty to Izz al-Din, as he was the only Zengid ruler strong enough to oppose Saladin. Izz al-Din was welcomed in Aleppo, but possessing it and Mosul put too great of a strain on his abilities. He thus, handed Aleppo to his brother Imad al-Din Zangi, in exchange for Sinjar. Saladin offered no opposition to these transactions in order to respect the treaty he previously made with the Zengids.On 11 May 1182, Saladin, along with half of the Egyptian Ayyubid army and numerous non-combatants, left Cairo for Syria. On the evening before he departed, he sat with his companions and the tutor of one of his sons quoted a line of poetry: \"enjoy the scent of the ox-eye plant of Najd, for after this evening it will come no more\". Saladin took this as an evil omen and he never saw Egypt again. Knowing that Crusader forces were massed upon the frontier to intercept him, he took the desert route across the Sinai Peninsula to Ailah at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. Meeting no opposition, Saladin ravaged the countryside of Montreal, whilst Baldwin's forces watched on, refusing to intervene. He arrived in Damascus in June to learn that Farrukh-Shah had attacked the Galilee, sacking Daburiyya and capturing Habis Jaldek, a fortress of great importance to the Crusaders. In July, Saladin dispatched Farrukh-Shah to attack Kawkab al-Hawa. Later, in August, the Ayyubids launched a naval and ground assault to capture Beirut; Saladin led his army in the Bekaa Valley. The assault was leaning towards failure and Saladin abandoned the operation to focus on issues in Mesopotamia.Kukbary (Muzaffar ad-Din G\u00f6kb\u00f6ri), the emir of Harran, invited Saladin to occupy the Jazira region, making up northern Mesopotamia. He complied and the truce between him and the Zengids officially ended in September 1182. Prior to his march to Jazira, tensions had grown between the Zengid rulers of the region, primarily concerning their unwillingness to pay deference to Mosul. Before he crossed the Euphrates, Saladin besieged Aleppo for three days, signaling that the truce was over.Once he reached Bira, near the river, he was joined by Kukbary and Nur al-Din of Hisn Kayfa and the combined forces captured the cities of Jazira, one after the other. First, Edessa fell, followed by Saruj, then Raqqa, Qirqesiya and Nusaybin. Raqqa was an important crossing point and held by Qutb al-Din Inal, who had lost Manbij to Saladin in 1176. Upon seeing the large size of Saladin's army, he made little effort to resist and surrendered on the condition that he would retain his property. Saladin promptly impressed the inhabitants of the town by publishing a decree that ordered a number of taxes to be canceled and erased all mention of them from treasury records, stating \"the most miserable rulers are those whose purses are fat and their people thin\". From Raqqa, he moved to conquer al-Fudain, al-Husain, Maksim, Durain, 'Araban, and Khabur\u2014all of which swore allegiance to him.Saladin proceeded to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin was not of great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied \"Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; when we come back, we shall have all the more strength to fight them.\" Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the emir of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities to the north and east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.\n\n\n=== Possession of Aleppo ===\n\nSaladin turned his attention from Mosul to Aleppo, sending his brother Taj al-Muluk Buri to capture Tell Khalid, 130 km northeast of the city. A siege was set, but the governor of Tell Khalid surrendered upon the arrival of Saladin himself on 17 May before a siege could take place. According to Imad ad-Din, after Tell Khalid, Saladin took a detour northwards to Aintab, but he gained possession of it when his army turned towards it, allowing to quickly move backward another c. 100 km towards Aleppo. On 21 May, he camped outside the city, positioning himself east of the Citadel of Aleppo, while his forces encircles the suburb of Banaqusa to the northeast and Bab Janan to the west. He stationed his men dangerously close to the city, hoping for an early success.Zangi did not offer long resistance. He was unpopular with his subjects and wished to return to his Sinjar, the city he governed previously. An exchange was negotiated where Zangi would hand over Aleppo to Saladin in return for the restoration of his control of Sinjar, Nusaybin, and Raqqa. Zangi would hold these territories as Saladin's vassals on terms of military service. On 12 June, Aleppo was formally placed in Ayyubid hands. The people of Aleppo had not known about these negotiations and were taken by surprise when Saladin's standard was hoisted over the citadel. Two emirs, including an old friend of Saladin, Izz al-Din Jurduk, welcomed and pledged their service to him. Saladin replaced the Hanafi courts with Shafi'i administration, despite a promise he would not interfere in the religious leadership of the city. Although he was short of money, Saladin also allowed the departing Zangi to take all the stores of the citadel that he could travel with and to sell the remainder\u2014which Saladin purchased himself. In spite of his earlier hesitation to go through with the exchange, he had no doubts about his success, stating that Aleppo was \"the key to the lands\" and \"this city is the eye of Syria and the citadel is its pupil\". For Saladin, the capture of the city marked the end of over eight years of waiting since he told Farrukh-Shah that \"we have only to do the milking and Aleppo will be ours\".After spending one night in Aleppo's citadel, Saladin marched to Harim, near the Crusader-held Antioch. The city was held by Surhak, a \"minor mamluk\". Saladin offered him the city of Busra and property in Damascus in exchange for Harim, but when Surhak asked for more, his own garrison in Harim forced him out. He was arrested by Saladin's deputy Taqi al-Din on allegations that he was planning to cede Harim to Bohemond III of Antioch. When Saladin received its surrender, he proceeded to arrange the defense of Harim from the Crusaders. He reported to the caliph and his own subordinates in Yemen and Baalbek that was going to attack the Armenians. Before he could move, however, there were a number of administrative details to be settled. Saladin agreed to a truce with Bohemond in return for Muslim prisoners being held by him and then he gave A'zaz to Alam ad-Din Suleiman and Aleppo to Saif al-Din al-Yazkuj\u2014the former was an emir of Aleppo who joined Saladin and the latter was a former mamluk of Shirkuh who helped rescue him from the assassination attempt at A'zaz.\n\n\n=== Fight for Mosul ===\n\nAs Saladin approached Mosul, he faced the issue of taking over a large city and justifying the action. The Zengids of Mosul appealed to an-Nasir, the Abbasid caliph at Baghdad whose vizier favored them. An-Nasir sent Badr al-Badr (a high-ranking religious figure) to mediate between the two sides. Saladin arrived at the city on 10 November 1182. Izz al-Din would not accept his terms because he considered them disingenuous and extensive, and Saladin immediately laid siege to the heavily fortified city.After several minor skirmishes and a stalemate in the siege that was initiated by the caliph, Saladin intended to find a way to withdraw without damage to his reputation while still keeping up some military pressure. He decided to attack Sinjar, which was held by Izz al-Din's brother Sharaf al-Din. It fell after a 15-day siege on 30 December. Saladin's soldiers broke their discipline, plundering the city; Saladin only managed to protect the governor and his officers by sending them to Mosul. After establishing a garrison at Sinjar, he awaited a coalition assembled by Izz al-Din consisting of his forces, those from Aleppo, Mardin, and Armenia. Saladin and his army met the coalition at Harran in February 1183, but on hearing of his approach, the latter sent messengers to Saladin asking for peace. Each force returned to their cities and al-Fadil wrote: \"They [Izz al-Din's coalition] advanced like men, like women they vanished.\"On 2 March, al-Adil from Egypt wrote to Saladin that the Crusaders had struck the \"heart of Islam\". Raynald de Ch\u00e2tillon had sent ships to the Gulf of Aqaba to raid towns and villages off the coast of the Red Sea. It was not an attempt to extend the Crusader influence into that sea or to capture its trade routes, but merely a piratical move. Nonetheless, Imad al-Din writes the raid was alarming to the Muslims because they were not accustomed to attacks on that sea, and Ibn al-Athir adds that the inhabitants had no experience with the Crusaders either as fighters or traders.Ibn Jubair was told that sixteen Muslim ships were burnt by the Crusaders, who then captured a pilgrim ship and caravan at Aidab. He also reported that they intended to attack Medina and remove Muhammad's body. Al-Maqrizi added to the rumor by claiming Muhammad's tomb was going to be relocated to Crusader territory so Muslims would make pilgrimages there. Al-Adil had his warships moved from Fustat and Alexandria to the Red Sea under the command of an Armenian mercenary Lu'lu. They broke the Crusader blockade, destroyed most of their ships, and pursued and captured those who anchored and fled into the desert. The surviving Crusaders, numbered at 170, were ordered to be killed by Saladin in various Muslim cities.From the point of view of Saladin, in terms of territory, the war against Mosul was going well, but he still failed to achieve his objectives and his army was shrinking; Taqi al-Din took his men back to Hama, while Nasir al-Din Muhammad and his forces had left. This encouraged Izz al-Din and his allies to take the offensive. The previous coalition regrouped at Harzam some 140 km from Harran. In early April, without waiting for Nasir al-Din, Saladin and Taqi al-Din commenced their advance against the coalition, marching eastward to Ras al-Ein unhindered. By late April, after three days of \"actual fighting\", according to Saladin, the Ayyubids had captured Amid. He handed the city to Nur al-Din Muhammad together with its stores, which consisted of 80,000 candles, a tower full of arrowheads, and 1,040,000 books. In return for a diploma granting him the city, Nur al-Din swore allegiance to Saladin, promising to follow him in every expedition in the war against the Crusaders, and repairing damage done to the city. The fall of Amid, in addition to territory, convinced Il-Ghazi of Mardin to enter the service of Saladin, weakening Izz al-Din's coalition.Saladin attempted to gain the Caliph an-Nasir's support against Izz al-Din by sending him a letter requesting a document that would give him legal justification for taking over Mosul and its territories. Saladin aimed to persuade the caliph claiming that while he conquered Egypt and Yemen under the flag of the Abbasids, the Zengids of Mosul openly supported the Seljuks (rivals of the caliphate) and only came to the caliph when in need. He also accused Izz al-Din's forces of disrupting the Muslim \"Holy War\" against the Crusaders, stating \"they are not content not to fight, but they prevent those who can\". Saladin defended his own conduct claiming that he had come to Syria to fight the Crusaders, end the heresy of the Assassins, and stop the wrong-doing of the Muslims. He also promised that if Mosul was given to him, it would lead to the capture of Jerusalem, Constantinople, Georgia, and the lands of the Almohads in the Maghreb, \"until the word of God is supreme and the Abbasid caliphate has wiped the world clean, turning the churches into mosques\". Saladin stressed that all this would happen by the will of God, and instead of asking for financial or military support from the caliph, he would capture and give the caliph the territories of Tikrit, Daquq, Khuzestan, Kish Island, and Oman.\n\n\n== Wars against Crusaders ==\n\nOn 29 September 1182, Saladin crossed the Jordan River to attack Beisan, which was found to be empty. The next day his forces sacked and burned the town and moved westwards. They intercepted Crusader reinforcements from Karak and Shaubak along the Nablus road and took a number of prisoners. Meanwhile, the main Crusader force under Guy of Lusignan moved from Sepphoris to al-Fula. Saladin sent out 500 skirmishers to harass their forces, and he himself marched to Ain Jalut. When the Crusader force\u2014reckoned to be the largest the kingdom ever produced from its own resources, but still outmatched by the Muslims\u2014advanced, the Ayyubids unexpectedly moved down the stream of Ain Jalut. After a few Ayyubid raids\u2014including attacks on Zir'in, Forbelet, and Mount Tabor\u2014the Crusaders still were not tempted to attack their main force, and Saladin led his men back across the river once provisions and supplies ran low.Crusader attacks provoked further responses by Saladin. Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon, in particular, harassed Muslim trading and pilgrimage routes with a fleet on the Red Sea, a water route that Saladin needed to keep open. In response, Saladin built a fleet of 30 galleys to attack Beirut in 1182. Raynald threatened to attack the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. In retaliation, Saladin twice besieged Kerak, Raynald's fortress in Oultrejordain, in 1183 and 1184. Raynald responded by looting a caravan of pilgrims on the Hajj in 1185. According to the later 13th-century Old French Continuation of William of Tyre, Raynald captured Saladin's sister in a raid on a caravan; this claim is not attested in contemporary sources, Muslim or Frankish, however, instead stating that Raynald had attacked a preceding caravan, and Saladin set guards to ensure the safety of his sister and her son, who came to no harm.Following the failure of his Kerak sieges, Saladin temporarily turned his attention back to another long-term project and resumed attacks on the territory of \u02bbIzz ad-D\u012bn (Mas\u02bb\u016bd ibn Mawd\u016bd ibn Zangi), around Mosul, which he had begun with some success in 1182. However, since then, Mas\u02bb\u016bd had allied himself with the powerful governor of Azerbaijan and Jibal, who in 1185 began moving his troops across the Zagros Mountains, causing Saladin to hesitate in his attacks. The defenders of Mosul, when they became aware that help was on the way, increased their efforts, and Saladin subsequently fell ill, so in March 1186 a peace treaty was signed.In July 1187, Saladin captured most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On 4 July 1187, at the Battle of Hattin, he faced the combined forces of Guy of Lusignan, King Consort of Jerusalem, and Raymond III of Tripoli. In this battle alone the Crusader force was largely annihilated by Saladin's determined army. It was a major disaster for the Crusaders and a turning point in the history of the Crusades. Saladin captured Raynald and was personally responsible for his execution in retaliation for his attacks against Muslim caravans. The members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the Muslims and the Crusaders, but Raynald ignored this and insulted the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, before murdering and torturing a number of them. Upon hearing this, Saladin swore an oath to personally execute Raynald. Guy of Lusignan was also captured. Seeing the execution of Raynald, he feared he would be next. However, his life was spared by Saladin, who said of Raynald, \"[i]t is not the wont of kings, to kill kings; but that man had transgressed all bounds, and therefore did I treat him thus.\"\n\n\n=== Capture of Jerusalem ===\nSaladin had captured almost every Crusader city. Saladin preferred to take Jerusalem without bloodshed and offered generous terms, but those inside refused to leave their holy city, vowing to destroy it in a fight to the death rather than see it handed over peacefully. Jerusalem capitulated to his forces on Friday, 2 October 1187, after a siege. When the siege had started, Saladin was unwilling to promise terms of quarter to the Frankish inhabitants of Jerusalem. Balian of Ibelin threatened to kill every Muslim hostage, estimated at 5,000, and to destroy Islam's holy shrines of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque if such quarter were not provided. Saladin consulted his council and the terms were accepted. The agreement was read out through the streets of Jerusalem so that everyone might within forty days provide for himself and pay to Saladin the agreed tribute for his freedom. An unusually low ransom for the times (around US$50 today) was to be paid for each Frank in the city, whether man, woman, or child, but Saladin, against the wishes of his treasurers, allowed many families who could not afford the ransom to leave. Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem organised and contributed to a collection that paid the ransoms for about 18,000 of the poorer citizens, leaving another 15,000 to be enslaved. Saladin's brother al-Adil \"asked Saladin for a thousand of them for his own use and then released them on the spot.\" Most of the foot soldiers were sold into slavery. Upon the capture of Jerusalem, Saladin summoned the Jews and permitted them to resettle in the city. In particular, the residents of Ashkelon, a large Jewish settlement, responded to his request. The subject ordered the churches repurposed as horse stables and the church towers destroyed.Tyre, on the coast of modern-day Lebanon, was the last major Crusader city that was not captured by Muslim forces. Strategically, it would have made more sense for Saladin to capture Tyre before Jerusalem; Saladin, however, chose to pursue Jerusalem first because of the importance of the city to Islam. Tyre was commanded by Conrad of Montferrat, who strengthened its defences and withstood two sieges by Saladin. In 1188, at Tortosa, Saladin released Guy of Lusignan and returned him to his wife, Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem. They went first to Tripoli, then to Antioch. In 1189, they sought to reclaim Tyre for their kingdom but were refused admission by Conrad, who did not recognize Guy as king. Guy then set about besieging Acre.Saladin was on friendly terms with Queen Tamar of Georgia. Saladin's biographer Bah\u0101' ad-D\u012bn ibn \u0160add\u0101d reports that, after Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem, the Georgian Queen sent envoys to the sultan to request the return of confiscated possessions of the Georgian monasteries in Jerusalem. Saladin's response is not recorded, but the queen's efforts seem to have been successful as Jacques de Vitry, the Bishop of Acre, reports the Georgians were, in contrast to the other Christian pilgrims, allowed a free passage into the city with their banners unfurled. Ibn \u0160add\u0101d furthermore claims that Queen Tamar outbid the Byzantine emperor in her efforts to obtain the relics of the True Cross, offering 200,000 gold pieces to Saladin who had taken the relics as booty at the battle of Hattin, but to no avail.\n\n\n=== Third Crusade ===\n\nHattin and the fall of Jerusalem prompted the Third Crusade (1189\u20131192), financed in England by a special \"Saladin tithe\". Richard the Lionheart, King of England led Guy's siege of Acre, conquered the city and executed 3,000 Muslim prisoners, including women and children. Bah\u0101' ad-D\u012bn wrote:The motives of this massacre are differently told; according to some, the captives were slain by way of reprisal for the death of those Christians whom the Musulmans had slain. Others again say that the king of England, on deciding to attempt the conquest of Ascalon, thought it unwise to leave so many prisoners in the town after his departure. God alone knows what the real reason was.\nThe armies of Saladin engaged in combat with the army of King Richard at the Battle of Arsuf on 7 September 1191, at which Saladin's forces suffered heavy losses and were forced to withdraw. After the battle of Arsuf, Richard occupied Jaffa, restoring the city's fortifications. Meanwhile, Saladin moved south, where he dismantled the fortifications of Ascalon to prevent this strategically important city, which lay at the junction between Egypt and Palestine, from falling into Crusader hands.In October 1191, Richard began restoring the inland castles on the coastal plain beyond Jaffa in preparation for an advance on Jerusalem. During this period, Richard and Saladin passed envoys back and forth, negotiating the possibility of a truce. Richard proposed that his sister, Joan of England, Queen of Sicily, should marry Saladin's brother and that Jerusalem could be their wedding gift. However, Saladin rejected this idea when Richard insisted that Saladin's brother convert to Christianity. Richard suggested that his niece Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany be the bride instead, an idea that Saladin also rejected.In January 1192, Richard's army occupied Beit Nuba, just twelve miles from Jerusalem, but withdrew without attacking the Holy City. Instead, Richard advanced south on Ascalon, where he restored the fortifications. In July 1192, Saladin tried to threaten Richard's command of the coast by attacking Jaffa. The city was besieged, and Saladin very nearly captured it; however, Richard arrived a few days later and defeated Saladin's army in a battle outside the city.The Battle of Jaffa (1192) proved to be the last military engagement of the Third Crusade. After Richard reoccupied Jaffa and restored its fortifications, he and Saladin again discussed terms. At last Richard agreed to demolish the fortifications of Ascalon, while Saladin agreed to recognize Crusader control of the Palestinian coast from Tyre to Jaffa. The Christians would be allowed to travel as unarmed pilgrims to Jerusalem, and Saladin's kingdom would be at peace with the Crusader states for the following three years.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nSaladin died of a fever on 4 March 1193, at Damascus, not long after King Richard's departure. In Saladin\u2019s possession at the time of his death were one piece of gold and forty pieces of silver. He had given away his great wealth to his poor subjects, leaving nothing to pay for his funeral. He was buried in a mausoleum in the garden outside the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. Originally the tomb was part of a complex which also included a school, Madrassah al-Aziziah, of which little remains except a few columns and an internal arch. Seven centuries later, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany donated a new marble sarcophagus to the mausoleum. However, the original sarcophagus was not replaced; instead, the mausoleum, which is open to visitors, now has two sarcophagi: the marble one placed on the side and the original wooden one, which covers Saladin's tomb. (Muslims are buried in a simple shroud, so if there are any sarcophagi present, they are usually used for covering the top of the Islamic burials.)\n\n\n== Family ==\nImad ad-Din al-Isfahani compiled a list of Saladin's sons along with their dates of birth, according to information provided by Saladin late in his reign. They were:\n\nal-Af\u1e0dal Nur al-Din Ali, emir of Damascus (b. 1 Shawwal 565 AH (c.\u200925 June 1170) in Egypt)\nal-\u2018Az\u012bz Imad al-Din Abu al-Fath Uthman, sultan of Egypt (b. 8 Jumada I 567 AH (c.\u200914 January 1172) in Egypt)\nal-\u1e92\u0101fir Muzaffar al-Din Abu al-Abbas Khidr (b. 5 Sha'ban 568 AH (c.\u200929March 1173) in Egypt)\nal-\u1e92\u0101hir Ghiyath al-Din Abu Mansur Ghazi, emir of Aleppo (b. mid-Ramadan 568 AH (May 1173) in Egypt)\nal-Mu\u2018izz Fath al-Din Abu Ya'qub Ishaq (b.

According to Abu Hamah, Imad missed two sons who were born to slave-women: Imad al-Din Shadhi and Nusrat al-Din Marwan. As for Saladin's daughter, she was Mu'nisah Khatun; she married her cousin al-Kamil Muhammad ibn Adil. Saladin also had other children who died before him, such as al-Mansur Hasan and Ahmad. Al-Zahir Dawud, whom Imad listed eighth, is recorded as being his twelfth son in a letter written by Saladin's minister.Not much is known of Saladin's wives or slave-women. He married Ismat al-Din Khatun, the widow of Nur al-Din Zengi, in 1176. She did not have children. One of his wives, Shamsah, is buried with her son al-Aziz in the tomb of al-Shafi'i.\n\n\n== Recognition and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Western world ===\n\nSaladin eventually achieved a great reputation in Europe as a chivalrous knight, due to his fierce struggle against the crusaders and his generosity. In The Divine Comedy he is mentioned as one of the virtuous non-Christians in limbo, and he is also depicted favorably in Boccaccio's The Decameron. Although Saladin faded into history after the Middle Ages, he appears in a sympathetic light in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play Nathan the Wise (1779) and in Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman (1825). The modern view of Saladin originates mainly from these texts. According to Jonathan Riley-Smith, Scott's portrayal of Saladin was that of a \"modern [19th-century] liberal European gentlemen, beside whom medieval Westerners would always have made a poor showing\". Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army, as long as they were able to pay the aforementioned ransom (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders).\nNotwithstanding the differences in beliefs, the Muslim Saladin was respected by Christian lords, Richard especially. Richard once praised Saladin as a great prince, saying that he was without doubt the greatest and most powerful leader in the Islamic world. Saladin in turn stated that there was not a more honorable Christian lord than Richard. After the treaty, Saladin and Richard sent each other many gifts as tokens of respect but never met face to face. In April 1191, a Frankish woman's three-month-old baby had been stolen from her camp and sold on the market. The Franks urged her to approach Saladin herself with her grievance. According to Bah\u0101' al-D\u012bn, Saladin used his own money to buy the child back:\n\nHe gave it to the mother and she took it; with tears streaming down her face, and hugged the baby to her chest. The people were watching her and weeping and I (Ibn Shaddad) was standing amongst them. She suckled it for some time and then Saladin ordered a horse to be fetched for her and she went back to camp. \n\n\n=== Muslim world ===\n\nIn 1898, German Emperor Wilhelm II visited Saladin's tomb to pay his respects. The visit, coupled with anti-imperialist sentiments, led nationalist Arabs to reinvent the image of Saladin and portray him as a hero of the struggle against the West. The image of Saladin they used was the romantic one created by Walter Scott and other Europeans in the West at the time. It replaced Saladin's reputation as a figure who had been largely forgotten in the Muslim world, eclipsed by more successful figures, such as Baybars of Egypt.Modern Arab states have sought to commemorate Saladin through various measures, often based on the image created of him in the 19th-century west. A governorate centered around Tikrit and Samarra in modern-day Iraq, Saladin Governorate, is named after him, as is Salahaddin University in Erbil, the largest city of Iraqi Kurdistan. A suburban community of Erbil, Masif Salahaddin, is also named after him.\nFew structures associated with Saladin survive within modern cities. Saladin first fortified the Citadel of Cairo (1175\u20131183), which had been a domed pleasure pavilion with a fine view in more peaceful times. In Syria, even the smallest city is centred on a defensible citadel, and Saladin introduced this essential feature to Egypt.\nAlthough the Ayyubid dynasty that he founded would only outlive him by 57 years, the legacy of Saladin within the Arab World continues to this day. With the rise of Arab nationalism in the 20th Century, particularly with regard to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, Saladin's heroism and leadership gained a new significance. Saladin's recapture of Palestine from the European Crusaders is considered an inspiration for modern-day Arabs' opposition to Zionism. Moreover, the glory and comparative unity of the Arab World under Saladin was seen as the perfect symbol for the new unity sought by Arab nationalists, such as Gamal Abdel Nasser. For this reason, the Eagle of Saladin became the symbol of revolutionary Egypt, and was subsequently adopted by several other Arab states (the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Libya, the State of Palestine, and Yemen).\nAmong Egyptian Shias, Saladin is dubbed as \"Kharab al-Din\", the destroyer of religion\u2014a derisive play on the name \"Saladin.\"\n\n\n== Cultural depictions of Saladin ==\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nThe Book of Saladin \u2013 A novel based on Saladin's life.\n\n\n=== Film, television and animation ===\nSaladin the Victorious \u2013 a 1963 Egyptian war drama film.

        "wiki": "Medina Lake is a reservoir on the Medina River in the Texas Hill Country of the United States.  It is operated by the Bexar/Medina/Atascosa County Agricultural District.  Medina Dam was completed in 1913 in a privately financed project, creating the lake to supply irrigation water for local agricultural use.  Lake Medina is in northeastern Medina County, and southeastern Bandera County, about 40 miles (64 km) northwest of San Antonio.\nIt is a crescent-shaped reservoir running west to east.  It is 18 miles (29 km) long and 3 miles (5 km) wide at its broadest point. It is contained by the Medina Dam at the lake's south end. At the time of the dam's construction, it was the largest concrete dam in the country and the fourth largest dam overall. The dam is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe lake is fed by and discharges back into the Medina River, and serves both recreational and irrigation uses.  Communities located along the lake are Mico, Lake Medina Shores and Lakehills.\nThere is also a Lake Medina east of Medina, Ohio, which recently was made a county park.\n\n\n== Fish populations ==\nMedina Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the reservoir for recreational fishing.  Fish in Medina Lake include largemouth bass, white bass, hybrid striped bass, catfish, and carp. Due to drought conditions lasting up until July 2015, recreational fish species had disappeared. Plans to restock the lake once levels reach viable levels were put in place. These plans were realized when the lake did reach these levels, which as of October 2, 2016, is 96.6% full.\n\n\n== Future and state of the lake ==\nAs part of the 2010\u201313 Southern United States drought, the lake water levels dropped below 5% capacity. Many cracks, oil drums and a Jeep are visible as a result of low water. Only one public boat ramp remains, located at Red Cove in Mico. A few showers in the Summer of 2013 helped the lake rise to 5.2%, but the dam was reopened in September as many people in the South Side of San Antonio use the lake for a water source. Many businesses have closed in the area, many residents have left and Lakehills has become somewhat of a ghost town.Heavy rainfall in the region as of May, 2015 brought the levels above 46% capacity. At that time, Medina Lake was about 28 feet low, down from 90 feet low mere months before.Due to heavy rains on the Medina River basin & the lake itself in May 2016, Medina Lake is 100% full and 1.5 feet above its conservation pool as of June 1, 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",
        "brit": "Park,  large area of ground set aside for recreation. The earliest parks were those of the Persian kings, who dedicated many square miles to the sport of hunting; by natural progression such reserves became artificially shaped by the creation of riding paths and shelters until the decorative possibilities became an inherent part of their character. A second type of park derived from such open-air public meeting places as those in ancient Athens, where the functions of an exercising ground, a social concourse, and an athletes\u2019 training ground were combined with elements of a sculpture gallery and religious centre.Boston Public GardenBoston Public Garden.Rick Harris (www.flickr.com/rickharris)In the parks of post-Renaissance times, there were extensive woods, rectilinear all\u00e9es stretching between one vantage point and another, raised galleries, and, in many cases, elaborate aviaries and cages for wild beasts, attesting to the hunting proclivities of the lords. Later the concept of the public park was somewhat domesticated. An area devoted simply to green landscape, a salubrious and attractive breathing space as a relief from the densely populated and industrialized city of the mid-19th century, became important. Examples of this type of park include Birkenhead Park in England, designed by Sir Joseph Paxton; Jean Charles Alphand\u2019s Bois de Boulogne, outside Paris; Central Park in New York City, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux; the Botanic Gardens in Melbourne, Australia; and Akashi Park in K\u014dbe, Japan. The design was generally romantic in character. The primary purpose was to provide for passive recreation\u2014walking and taking the air in agreeable surroundings reminiscent of the unspoiled country.What primarily differentiates modern parks is their accommodation for active recreation. Park areas differ considerably from country to country, and their designs reflect differences in climate, cultural attitudes, social habits, and pastimes. In the gardens of the Generalife, a Spanish family may enjoy its holiday outing in a shaded bosque near a cool fountain. On an evening in Venice, a procession with banners and torches may sweep into one of the little piazzas. In the Buttes-Chaumont in Paris, children may reach out from wooden horses on the merry-go-round to seize a brass ring. During the bright summer weekends in Stockholm, residents cultivate vegetables in allotment gardens that are leased to them by the park department. In Israel, Iran, and Pakistan, basketball, football (soccer), and kabadei (a game like rugby) are played in parks; in Japan, volleyball, tennis, and sumo (wrestling) may be seen. Almost universally, there is recognition of the creative possibilities of leisure and of community responsibility to provide space and facilities for recreation.The facilities include outdoor theatres, zoos, concert shells, historical exhibits, concessions for dining and dancing, amusement areas, boating, and areas for sports of all kinds, such as fly-casting pools and skating rinks. There is always the danger that the original reason for creating the park\u2014i.e., to bring a part of nature within reach of the city dweller\u2014will be sacrificed to its specific recreational functions. It is difficult to keep the balance, because the tempo of urban life has mounted and with it the requirements for intensive use.Gehry, Frank: Jay Pritzker PavilionJay Pritzker Pavilion, designed by Gehry Partners, 2004; as seen from the Great Lawn, Millennium Park, Chicago, Illinois.\u00a9 Chicago Architecture Foundation (A Britannica Publishing Partner)\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nAnother danger to the public park is the automobile. With the tremendous growth in automobile traffic and, consequently, increasing pressure from traffic authorities for more land, there has been hardly a major city that has not lost sections of its parks to highways. There has been a growing awareness, particularly in Europe, that large-scale urban planning should be carried out in such a way that traffic functions are clearly separate and do not encroach on other spheres. In the United States, there have been victories for the park user against the automobile; in San Francisco, the state freeway was halted at the city limits, and, in New York City, Washington Square was closed to traffic.It is unfortunate that the word park has come to connote almost exclusively the \u201cromantic\u201d style park or English garden of the 19th century. In truth, there are other traditions whose influence has been equally vital. How different from the Parisian Buttes-Chaumont, for instance, are the Tuileries across the river. These were laid out under the supervision of Marie de M\u00e9dicis in the style of the Boboli Gardens in Florence. Also the parks of Versailles, the Belvedere Park in Vienna, the Vatican Gardens in Rome, Hellbrun in Salzburg, Blenheim in England, Drottningsholm in Sweden, and Peterhof (Petrodvorets) in Russia are all parks that were planned in the Italian Baroque tradition. They were intended not to be a foil or escape from the oppressive city but rather to be its central dramatic focus\u2014a display for the opulence of rulers, a piazza for the moving of great crowds, from the tournament and guild ceremonies of Florence in the 17th century to the formal pageantry of the court. It was in the Baroque park that the handling, control, and stimulation of crowds in the open air developed as one of the great arts of the urban designer.Another park tradition that has had worldwide influence is that of Islam. In Tehran, Marrakech, Sevilla (Seville), Lahore, and Delhi, this tradition is the dominant one and, as with all parks, developed according to the climate, social custom, and religious ethos. The original Muslim idea was to think of the garden as a paradise, a symbol of the afterlife as an oasis of beauty blooming in the earthly desert. Water and the cypress are the two main elements. Within the park, then, are water, the symbol of purity, in the four-way river of paradise, and trees (above all the cypress, symbolizing life), surrounded by high walls to keep out the dry wind. Everywhere, in keeping with Muslim belief, the design pattern is abstract rather than figurative. The fundamental idea creates its own specific technical skills; nowhere is there more artful use of irrigation for plants, of jets of water to cool the air, of orchards for shade, of colour to break up the sun\u2019s glare, or of the use of masonry patterns than in these Islamic gardens.The Taj Mahal in India dates from the 17th century, when by the testament of Shah Jahan this area of 20 acres (8 hectares) was to be maintained as a public grounds in perpetuity, where the poor could walk and pick fruit. In China and Japan, a similar opening of the royal precinct for public enjoyment, as with the Winter Palace or the Katsura Imperial Villa Gardens in Ky\u014dto, has been a more recent development. The great religious shrines, however, have always resembled Western parks. The Horimonji temple in Tokyo, the Mimeguri shrine, the great Buddhist temple at Ise, and the Inner (Shint\u014d) shrine at Mieshima are examples of an age-old garden tradition in which humanity is but \u201cone of a thousand things\u201d and where nature is presented in an idealized and symbolic way as an object for contemplation and spiritual enjoyment. In their techniques of horticulture and in their use of stones, water, and surface textures, the gardens of East Asia are of a high level. This Eastern tradition had its effect on European park design in the 18th century and again in the 20th century, as in the grounds for the UNESCO building in Paris, designed by Isamu Noguchi.

        "wiki": "Medina, officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0629\u200e, romanized: al-Madinat al-Munawwarah, lit. 'The Enlightened City'), commonly simplified as Mad\u012bnah or Madinah, is one of the three holiest cities in Islam and the capital of the Medina Region of Saudi Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782, making it the fourth-most populous city in the country. Located at the core of the Madinah Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293 km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys, agricultural spaces, older dormant volcanoes and the Nafud desert.\nThe city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in Islamic tradition, the other two being Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory. The original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib and it is referred to by the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab (The Confederates). It was renamed Mad\u012bnat an-Nab\u012b (City of the Prophet or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (The Enlightened City), before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in English as Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah al-Munawwarah interchangeably.The city is known to have existed for over 1500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca, otherwise known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), composed of the citizens of Madinah, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun, collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.Much like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short existence. The region is known to have been controlled by Arabian Jewish tribes (up to the 5th century CE), the 'Aws and Khazraj (up to Muhammad's arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622\u2013660 CE), Umayyads (660\u2013749 CE), Abbasids (749\u20131254 CE), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254\u20131517 CE), the Ottomans (1517\u20131805 CE), the First Saudi State (1805\u20131811 CE), Muhammad Ali Pasha (1811\u20131840 CE), the Ottomans for a second time (1840\u20131918), the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca (1918\u20131925 CE) and finally is in the hands of the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1925\u2013present CE).In addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi' cemetery and the Seven Mosques among others. Recently, after the Saudi conquest, the Saudis carried out a demolition of several tombs and domes in and around the region fearing these might become sites of association of others in worship beside Allah (shirk).\n\n\n== History ==\nMedina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n\n==== Yathrib ====\nBefore the advent of Islam, the city was known as Yathrib (pronounced [\u02c8ja\u03b8r\u026ab]; \u064a\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0628). The word Yathrib has been recorded in \u0100yah (verse) 13 of Surah (chapter) 33 of the Qur'an.[Quran 33:13] and is thus known to have been the name of the city up to the Battle of the Trench. Muhammad later forbade calling the city by this name.\n\n\n==== Taybah and Tabah ====\nSometime after the battle, the Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah (the Kind or the Good) ([\u02c8t\u02e4ajba]; \u0637\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629) and Tabah (Arabic: \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e\u0629\u200e) which is of similar meaning. This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, \"Ya Taybah!\" (O Taybah!). The two names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the Kind).\n\n\n==== Madinah ====\nThe city has also been called Madinah in some ahadith. The names al-Mad\u012bnah an-Nabawiyyah (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629) and Mad\u012bnat un-Nab\u012b (both meaning \"City of the Prophet\" or \"The Prophet's City\") and al-Mad\u012bnat ul-Munawwarah (\"The Enlightened City\") are all derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in official documents and road signage, along with Madinah.\n\n\n=== Early history and Jewish control ===\nMedina is known to have been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BC. By the fourth century CE, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish tribes that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Qurayza, and Banu Nadir. Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian Empire's domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the Persian Shah.The situation changed after the arrival of two new Arab tribes, the 'Aws or Banu 'Aws and the Khazraj, also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but later revolted and became independent.\n\n\n=== Under the 'Aws and Khazraj ===\nToward the end of the 5th century, the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the 'Aws and the Khazraj. However, according to Scottish scholar, William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.Early Muslim chronicler Ibn Ishaq tells of an ancient conflict between the last Yemenite king of the Himyarite Kingdom and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognised the Ka'bah as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.Eventually the Banu 'Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's Hijrah (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the 'Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj. They fought a total of four wars.Their last and bloodiest known battle was the Battle of Bu'ath, fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad. The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. He was the most respected inhabitant of the city prior to Muhammad's arrival. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of Yathrib met secretly with Muhammad in 'Aqaba, a place outside Mecca, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to the city, where Muhammad could serve a mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n\n=== Under Muhammad and the Rashidun ===\n\nIn 622 CE (1 AH), Muhammad and an estimated 70 Meccan Muhajirun left Mecca over a period of a few months for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced the new religion of Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as the leader of the city. The natives of Yathrib who had converted to Islam of any background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called the Ansar (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the Zakat tax.\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, all parties in the area agreed to the Constitution of Medina, which committed all parties to mutual cooperation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess. In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as Kit\u0101b Dimmat al-Nabi, written in the 17th year of the Hijra (638 CE), and which gave express liberty to Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks. In return, they were to pay the jizya annually for protection by their patrons.\n\n\n==== Battle of Uhud ====\n\nIn the year 625 CE (3 AH), Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a senior chieftain of Mecca who later converted to Islam, led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the Qurayshi army with an estimated 1,000 troops, but just as the army approached the battlefield, 300 men under 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew, dealing a severe blow to the Muslim army's morale. Muhammad continued marching with his now 700-strong force and ordered a group of 50 archers to climb a small hill, now called Jabal ar-Rummaah (The Archers' Hill) to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry and to provide protection to the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to retreat. The frontline was pushed further and further away from the archers and foreseeing the battle to have be a victory for the Muslims, the archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading the rest to not disobey their Muhammad's orders.\nSeeing that the archers were starting to descend from the hill, Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded his unit to ambush the hill and his cavalry unit pursued the descending archers were systematically slain by being caught in the plain ahead of the hill and the frontline, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill who were shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but with little to no effect. However, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Madanis (people of Medina) suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.\n\n\n==== Battle of the Trench ====\n\nIn 627 CE (5 AH), Abu Sufyan led another force toward Medina. Knowing of his intentions, Muhammad asked for proposals for defending the northern flank of the city, as the east and west were protected by volcanic rocks and the south was covered with palm trees. Salman al-Farsi, a Persian Sahabi who was familiar with Sasanian war tactics recommended digging a trench to protect the city and the Prophet accepted it. The subsequent siege came to be became known as the Battle of the Trench and the Battle of the Confederates. After a month-long siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again due to the harsh winter.\nDuring the siege, Abu Sufyan contacted the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the Muslim defenders and effectively encircle the defenders. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Aws negotiated on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to appoint one of their chiefs who had converted to Islam, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason in the Book of Deutoronomy. This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The French historian Robert Mantran proposes that from this point of view it was successful\u2014from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.In the ten years following the hijra, Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he marched on Mecca, entering it without battle in 630 CE or 8 AH. Despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca, the growing importance of Mecca in Islam, the significance of the Ka'bah as the center of the Islamic world, as the direction of prayer (Qibla), and in the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the base of operations of the early Rashidun Caliphate.The city is presumed to have been renamed Madinat al-Nabi (\"City of the Prophet\" in Arabic) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and the city being the site of his burial. Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the Aramaic word Medinta, which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.\nUnder the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the reign of 'Uthman ibn al-Affan, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at some of his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE and assassinated him in his own home. Ali, the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in Iraq for being in a more strategic location. Since then, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power. Medina witnessed little to no economic growth during and after Ali's reign.\n\n\n=== Under subsequent Islamic regimes ===\n\n\n==== Umayyad Caliphate ====\nAfter al-Hasan, the son of 'Ali, ceded power to Mu'awiyah I, son of Abu Sufyan, Mu'awiyah marched into Kufa, Ali's capital, and received the allegiance of the local 'Iraqis. This is considered to be the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. Mu'awiyah's governors took special care of Medina and dug the 'Ayn az-Zarqa'a (\"Blue Spring\") spring along with a project that included the creation of underground ducts for the purposes of irrigation. Dams were built in some of the wadis and the subsequent agricultural boom led to the strengthening of the economy.\n\nFollowing a period of unrest during the Second Fitna in 679 CE (60 AH), Husayn ibn 'Ali was martyred at Karbala and Yazid assumed unchecked control for the next three years. In 682 CE (63 AH), Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself Caliph of Mecca and the people of Medina swore allegiance to him. This led to an eight-year-long period of economic distress for the city. In 692 CE (73 AH), the Umayyads regained power and Medina experienced its second period of huge economic growth. Trade improved and more people moved into the city. The banks of Wadi al-'Aqiq were now lush with greenery. This period of peace and prosperity coincided with the rule of 'Umar ibn Abdulaziz, who many consider to be the fifth of the Rashidun.\n\n\n==== Abbasid Caliphate ====\nAbdulbasit A. Badr, in his book, Madinah, The Enlightened City: History and Landmarks, divides this period into three distinct phases:\n\nBadr describes the period between 749\u2013974 CE (132\u2013363 AH) as a push-and-pull between peace and political turmoil, while Medina continued to pay allegiance to the Abbasids. From 974\u20131151 CE (363\u2013546 AH), Medina was in a liaison with the Fatimids, even though the political stand between the two remained turbulent and did not exceed the normal allegiance. From 1151 CE (546 AH) onwards, Medina paid allegiance to the Zengids, and the Emir Nuruddin Zangi took care of the roads used by pilgrims and funded the fixing of the water sources and streets. When he visited Medina in 1162 CE (557 AH), he ordered the construction of a new wall that encompassed the new urban areas outside the old city wall. Zangi was succeeded by Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, who supported Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Governor of Medina, and greatly funded the growth of the city while slashing taxes paid by the pilgrims. He also funded the Bedouins who lived on the routes used by pilgrims to protect them on their journeys. The later Abbasids also continued to fund the expenses of the city. While Medina was formally allied with the Abbasids during this period, they maintained closer relations with the Zengids and Ayyubids. The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2 m) high, dating from this period, and was flanked with towers. Of its four gates, the Bab al-Salam (\"The Gate of Peace\"), was remarked for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, the west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations.\n\n\n==== Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo ====\nAfter a brutal long conflict with the Abbasids, the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo took over the Egyptian governorate and effectively gained control of Medina. In 1256 CE (Rajab 654 AH), Medina was threatened by lava from the Harrat Rahat volcanic region but was narrowly saved from being burnt after the lava turned northward. During Mamluk reign, the Masjid an-Nabawi caught fire twice. Once in 1256 CE (654 AH), when the storage caught fire, burning the entire mosque, and the other time in 1481 CE (886 AH), when the masjid was struck by lightning. This period also coincided with an increase in scholarly activity in Medina, with scholars such as Ibn Farhun, Al-Hafiz Zain al-Din al-'Iraqi, Al Sakhawi and others settling in the city. The striking iconic Green Dome also found its beginnings as a cupola built under Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun as-Salihi in 1297 CE (678 AH).\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\n\n==== First Ottoman period ====\nIn 1517 CE (923 AH), the first Ottoman period began with Selim I's conquest of Mamluk Egypt. This added Medina to their territory and they continued the tradition of showering Medina with money and aid. In 1532 CE (939 AH), Suleiman the Magnificent built a secure fortress around the city and constructed a strong castle armed by an Ottoman battalion to protect the city. This is also the period in which many of the Prophet's Mosque's modern features were built even though it wasn't painted green yet. These suburbs also had walls and gates. The Ottoman sultans took a keen interest in the Prophet's Mosque and redesigned it over and over to suit their preferences.\n\n\n==== First Saudi insurgency ====\nAs the Ottomans' hold over their domains broke loose, the Madanis pledged alliance to Saud bin Abdulaziz, founder of the First Saudi state in 1805 CE (1220 AH), who quickly took over the city. In 1811 CE (1226 AH), Muhammad Ali Pasha, Ottoman commander and Wali of Egypt, commanded two armies under each of his two sons to seize Medina, the first one, under the elder Towson Pasha, failed to take Medina. But the second one, a larger army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, succeeded after battling a fierce resistance movement.\n\n\n==== Muhammad Ali Pasha's era ====\nAfter defeating his Saudi foes, Muhammad Ali Pasha took over governance of Medina and although he did not formally declare independence, his governance took on more of a semi-autonomous style. Muhammad's sons, Towson and Ibrahim, alternated in the governance of the city. Ibrahim renovated the city's walls and the Prophet's Mosque. He established a grand provision distribution center (taqiyya) to distribute food and alms to the needy and Medina lived a period of security and peace, In 1840 CE (1256 AH), Muhammad moved his troops out of the city and officially handed the city to the central Ottoman command.\n\n\n==== Second Ottoman period ====\n\nFour years in 1844 CE (1260 AH), after Muhammad Ali Pasha's departure, Davud Pasha was given the position of governor of Egypt under the Ottoman sultan. Davud was responsible for renovating the Prophet's mosque on Sultan Abdulmejid I's orders. When Abdul Hamid II assumed power, he made Medina stand out of the desert with a number of modern marvels, including a radio communication station, an power plant for the Prophet's Mosque and its immediate vicinity, a telegraph line between Medina and Istanbul, and the Hejaz railway which ran from Damascus to Medina with a planned extension to Mecca. Within one decade, the population of the city multiplied by leaps and bounds and reached 80,000. Around this time, Medina started falling prey to a new threat, the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca in the south. Medina witnessed the longest siege in its history during and after World War I.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\n\n==== Sharifate of Mecca and Saudi conquest ====\nThe Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, first attacked Medina on 6 June 1916 CE or 4 Sha'aban 1334 AH, in the middle of World War I. Four days later, Husayn held Medina in a bitter 3-year siege, during which the people faced food shortages, widespread disease and mass emigration. Fakhri Pasha, governor of Medina, tenaciously held on during the Siege of Medina from 10 June 1916 and refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the Armistice of Moudros, until he was arrested by his own men and the city was taken over by the Sharifate on 10 January 1919. Husayn largely won the war due to his alliance with the British. In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly dispatched the Sacred Relics of Muhammad to the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. As of 1920, the British described Medina as \"much more self-supporting than Mecca.\" After the Great War, the Sharif of Mecca, Sayyid Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, the people of Medina secretly entered an agreement with Ibn Saud in 1924, and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz conquered Medina as part of the Saudi conquest of Hejaz on 5 December 1925 (19 Jumada I 1344 AH) which gave way to the whole of the Hejaz being incorporated into the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n==== Under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ====\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focused more on the expansion of the city and the demolition of former sites that violated Islamic principles and Islamic law such as the tombs at al-Baqi. Nowadays, the city mostly only holds religious significance and as such, just like Mecca, has given rise to a number of hotels surrounding the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, which unlike the Masjid Al-\u1e24ar\u0101m, is equipped with an underground parking. The old city's walls have been destroyed and replaced with the three ring roads that encircle Medina today, named in order of length, King Faisal Road, King Abdullah Road and King Khalid Road. Medina's ring roads generally see less traffic overall compared to the four ring roads of Mecca.\n\nAn international airport, named the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport, now serves the city and is located on Highway 340, known locally as the Old Qassim Road. The city now sits at the crossroads of two major Saudi Arabian highways, Highway 60, known as the Qassim\u2013Medina Highway, and Highway 15 which connects the city to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk in the north and onward, known as the Al Hijrah Highway or Al Hijrah Road, after Muhammad's journey. The old Ottoman railway system was shutdown after their departure from the region and the old railway station has now been converted into a museum. The city has recently seen another connection and mode of transport between it and Mecca, the Haramain high-speed railway line connects the two cities via King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh, King Abdulaziz International Airport and the city of Jeddah in under 3 hours.\nThough the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, the Haram area of Medina itself is much smaller than that of Mecca and Medina has recently seen an increase in the number of Muslim and Non-Muslim expatriate workers of other nationalities, most commonly South Asian peoples and people from other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded al-Masjid an-Nabawi.\n\n\n==== Destruction of heritage ====\n\nSaudi Arabia is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to shirk (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old. Critics have described this as \"Saudi vandalism\" and claim that 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost in Medina and Mecca over the last 50 years. The most famous example of this is the demolition of al-Baqi.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMedina is located in the Hejaz region which is a 200 km (124 mi) wide strip between the Nafud desert and the Red Sea. Located approximately 720 km (447 mi) northwest of Riyadh which is at the center of the Saudi desert, the city is 250 km (155 mi) away from the west coast of Saudi Arabia and at an elevation of approximately 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. It lies at 39\u00ba36' longitude east and 24\u00ba28' latitude north. It covers an area of about 589 square kilometres (227 square miles). The city has been divided into twelve (12) districts, 7 of which have been categorised as urban districts, while the other 5 have been categorised as suburban.\n\n\n=== Elevation ===\nLike most cities in the Hejaz region, Medina is situated at a very high elevation. Almost three times as high as Mecca, the city is situated at 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Mount Uhud is the highest peak in Medina and is 1,077 meters (3,533 feet) tall.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains and volcanic hills. The soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly basalt, while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era.  It is surrounded by a number of famous mountains, most notably Jabal Al-Hujjaj (The Pilgrims' Mountain) to the west, Sal'aa Mountain to the north-west, Jabal al-'Ir or Caravan Mountain to the south and Mount Uhud to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the tripoint of the three valleys (wadis) of Wadi al 'Aql, Wadi al 'Aqiq, and Wadi al Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry deserted mountainous region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Medina falls in a hot desert climate region (BWh). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about 43 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) with nights about 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F). Temperatures above 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) at night to 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May. In summer, the wind is north-western, while in the spring and winters, is south-western.\n\n\n== Significance in Islam ==\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of two mosques, Masjid Quba'a and al-Masjid an-Nabawi. Both of these mosques were built by Muhammad himself. Islamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times in the Quran, two examples are Surah At-Tawbah. verse 101 and Al-Hashr. verse 8. Medinan suras are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts and they are also larger in number. Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in Sahih Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik said the Prophet said: \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people.\"\n\n\n=== The Prophet's Mosque (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) ===\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a prayer in The Prophet's Mosque equates to 1,000 prayers in any other mosque except the Masjid al-Haram where one prayer equates to 100,000 prayers in any other mosque. The mosque was initially just an open space for prayer with a raised and covered minbar (pulpit) built within seven months and was located beside the Prophet's rawdhah (residence, although the word literally means garden) to its side along with the houses of his wives. The mosque was expanded several times throughout history, with many of its internal features developed overtime to suit contemporary standards.\n\nThe modern Prophet's Mosque is famed for the Green Dome situated directly above the Prophet's rawdhah, which currently serves as the burial site for Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab and is used in road signage along with its signature minaret as an icon for Medina itself. The entire piazza of the mosque is shaded from the sun by 250 membrane umbrellas. \n\n\n=== Quba'a Mosque ===\n\nIt is Sunnah to perform prayer at the Quba'a Mosque. According to a hadith, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad said, \"Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\"\nand in another narration,\"Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque \u2013 meaning the Mosque of Quba\u2019 \u2013 and prays there, that will be equivalent to \u2018Umrah.\"It has been recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim that Muhammad used to go to Quba'a every Saturday to offer two rak'ahs of Sunnah prayer. The mosque at Quba'a was built by Muhammad himself upon his arrival to the old city of Medina. Quba'a and the mosque has been referred in the Qur'an indirectly in Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108.\n\n\n=== Other sites ===\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Qiblatayn ====\n\nMasjid al-Qiblatayn is another mosque historically important to Muslims. Muslims believe that Muhammad was commanded to change his direction of prayer (qibla) from praying toward Jerusalem to praying toward the Ka'bah at Mecca, as he was commanded in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 143 and 144. The mosque is currently being expanded to be able to hold more than 4,000 worshippers.\n\n\n==== Masjid al-Fath and the Seven Mosques ====\n\nThree of these historic six mosques were combined recently into the larger Masjid al-Fath with an open courtyard. Sunni sources claim that there is no hadith or any other evidence to prove that Muhammad may have said something about the virtue of these mosques.\n\n\n==== Al-Baqi' Cemetery ====\n\nAl-Baqi' is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of Muhammad, caliphs and scholars are known to have been buried.\n\n\n=== In Islamic eschatology ===\n\n\n==== End of civilization ====\nConcerning the end of civilization in Medina, Abu Hurairah is recorded to have said that Muhammad said:\"The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada'h, they will fall down on their faces dead.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 98)Sufyan ibn Abu Zuhair said Muhammad said:\"Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 99)\n\n\n==== Protection from plague and ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah) ====\n\nWith regards to Medina's protection from plague and ad-Dajjal, the following ahadith were recorded:\n\nby Abu Bakra:\"The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 103)by Abu Hurairah:\"There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.\" (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 104)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2018, the recorded population was 2,188,138, with a growth rate of 2.32%. Being a destination of Muslims from around the world, Medina witnesses illegal immigration after performing Hajj or Umrah, despite the strict rules the government has enforced. However, the Central Hajj Commissioner Prince Khalid bin Faisal stated that the numbers of illegal staying visitors dropped by 29% in 2018.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion followed by the majority of the population of Medina.\nSunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali) constitute the majority, while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the Nakhawila. Outside the haram, there are significant numbers of Non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSimilar to that of Mecca, Medina exhibits a cross-cultural environment, a city where people of many nationalities and cultures live together and interact with each other on a daily basis. This only helps the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. Established in 1985, the biggest publisher of Quran in the world, it employs around 1100 people and publishes 361 different publications in many languages.

          "I'd heard about this place from a friend who came here last year. Trying to get a taxi proved fun as different drivers made up prices as we walked down the street so do you know what.... we just carried on walking all the way. It actually made for a much more adventurous and",
          "So much of what we experienced in Cuba was cities that it was nice to get a touch of nature on this walk. As stated in other reviews it takes about 30-45 min to walk each way but it is fairly easy. The waterfall was nice but don't expect to be alone - lots of other tourists",
          "I've done this walk a couple of times as it is very close to the Trinidad town. Beautiful walk and great waterfall at the end. Swim into the bat cave by the waterfall, it's quite the experience. There's a bar at the entrance to stock up on refreshments.",

          "Firstly IF you take a taxi, negotiate a return rate and reasonable time to spend hiking/ swimming. Or dismiss the cab politely if one-way. Try to come early before tour buses. Entrance is only $10 with a special cocktail included (worth the hike). TIP: wear supportive footwear",
          "I did not expect too much from this place as it is very close to very touristic Trinidad. You have to expect to meet quite a lot of people on the way to the waterfall Salto de Javira. It is better to go early before buses and taxi cars arrive. The waterfall has nice pool to",

          "The walking to the waterfalls isn't too hard - 45 mins each direction. Take a lot of water with you, because it's hot even when it's raining. So it's very refreshing to swim in the waterfalls water eventually, even though the water is frozen. It costs 10CUC to get inside and",
          "Nice and calm place in Trinidad. Great to make a walk and rest a little bit from the hot shining sun :)",
          "Booked a cabalgata (horse trip), which went through fields and parks. The way there is very nice, we had a stop for breakfast and a stop for coffee (just a hut in the middle of a farm but the best coffee I've had in Cuba). The waterfall itself is really nice and the whole trip",
          "We drove there in our hire car. Wasn't quick, but thoroughly manageable. We did the walk late afternoon (around 4pm) and was cool, including a short rain shower. The trek is beautiful - lots to see, and some great stop offs. Swimming in the waterfall was one of the highlights of",
          "This lovely spot within a protected park consists of a farm - style restaurant that specializes in catfish, a fish farm and a 3.6km trail to the refreshing waterfall (the Huellas de la Hist\u00f3ria). You can also do horseback riding out there. If you hike to El Cubano from Trinidad,",
          "What's better than a morning hike followed by a swim under a waterfall... nothing. El Cubano is gorgeous. The hike is so lush and not intense, which is nice because the heat is full on. The waterfall is stunning and being able to jump off the side into the water was",
          "Do not go there with a rental car, as you will probably get damages to it. Best option is to take a cab. Do not wear slippers, but walking shoes. If not you will have troubles to make the trip. Go there early morning, otherwise you will have a lot of other visitors and will have",
          "we had a good local guide take us up to the falls and she pointed out a number of interesting places and things along the walk. We stopped in the farmers hut and drank the tea supplied. The guide spotted a stork along the banks but I spotted the logger headed king bird and the",

          "The place is a hidden gem just a few km from Trinidad. The road to get there can get a real stop causer, it is a dirt road. But the park is nice, a bit Cuban...",
          "This is a most see!!. great location and the best natural enjoyment any body can have. The claiming is very mile. The river is extremely clear and the water super transparent. There is a cave behind the waterfall that will leave you breathless.",
          "if you want to avoid long trips to waterfall go here. this is a waterfall near the city just 4 or 5km away.",
          "It's a very pleasant park where you can spent relaxing quite a few hours. There's about 2km walk to the waterfall which is easy ( a bit up the hill) and on the way you have river 'pools' where you can have a swim to cool yourself on a hot day. I would recomend 2-3hours there.",
          "This is a pleasant walk in the woods. Initially there are some fairly steep climbs which can seem daunting. However, it is not far to the waterfalls and the rest of the path is much easier. Pleasantly cool under the trees. Don't forget to look in at the farm house to see how",

          "This park allows for a 45min walk on relatively easy paths to a small waterfall with fresh (and cold!) water. Entrance fee to the park a bit hefty but for some quiet nature time without the ubiquitous Polo Montanez songs it was worth it!",
          "Most of the travellers have qualified and quantified this spot. It is quite a walk to the waterfalls but it's well worth it. The water is so refreshing. On the way see if you can spot the local birds especially the Tocororo (National Bird). It's not an easy walk and no",
          "The walk to the waterfall is between 20/25 and 50 minutes, depends on how fast you walk... But anyway it's worth it! It's nice and the experience to jump into it and swim in the cave behind the waterfall is refreshing, enjoyed it a lot.",

        "wiki": "The Arabian Peninsula (; Arabic: \u0634\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u200e, shibhu l-jaz\u012brati l-\u02bfarabiyyah, \"Arabian Peninsula\" or \u062c\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628, jaz\u012bratu l-\u02bfarab, \"Island of the Arabs\") is a peninsula of Western Asia, situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian Plate. The Peninsula, plus Bahrain, the Socotra Archipelago and other nearby islands form a geopolitical region called Arabia, which is the largest region in the world without any river.Arabian Peninsula is the largest peninsula in the world, at 3,237,500 km2 (1,250,000 sq mi). Arabia  consists of seven countries: Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the Red Sea between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the Red Sea to the west and southwest, the Persian Gulf to the northeast, the Levant to the north and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. The peninsula plays a critical geopolitical role in the Arab world due to its vast reserves of oil and natural gas.\nBefore the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: Red Sea Coast (Tihamah), Central Plateau (Al-Yamama), Indian Ocean Coast (Hadhramaut) and Persian Gulf Coast (Al-Bahrain). Hejaz and Najd make up most of Saudi Arabia. Southern Arabia consists of Yemen and some parts of Saudi Arabia (Najran, Jizan, Asir) and Oman (Dhofar). Eastern Arabia consists of the entire coastal strip of the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Arabian Peninsula is located in the continent of Asia and bounded by (clockwise) the Persian Gulf on the northeast, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman on the east, the Arabian Sea on the southeast, the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel and Somali Sea on the south, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait on the southwest and the Red Sea, which is located on the southwest and west. The northern portion of the peninsula merges with the Syrian Desert with no clear borderline, although the northern boundary of the peninsula is generally considered to be the northern borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.The most prominent feature of the peninsula is desert, but in the southwest, there are mountain ranges, which receive greater rainfall than the rest of the peninsula. Harrat ash Shaam is a large volcanic field that extends from northwestern Arabia into Jordan and southern Syria.\n\n\n=== Political boundaries ===\n\nThe Peninsula's constituent countries are (clockwise from north to south) Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the east, Oman on the southeast, Yemen on the south and Saudi Arabia at the center. The island country of Bahrain lies off the east coast of the Peninsula. Due to Yemen's jurisdiction over the Socotra Archipelago, the Peninsula's geopolitical outline faces the Guardafui Channel and the Somali Sea to the south.\n\nSix countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers the greater part of the Peninsula. The majority of the population of the Peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The Peninsula contains the world's largest reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are economically the wealthiest in the region. Qatar, a small peninsula in the Persian Gulf on the larger peninsula, is home to the Arabic-language television station Al Jazeera and its English-language subsidiary Al Jazeera English. Kuwait, on the border with Iraq, is an important country strategically, forming one of the main staging grounds for coalition forces mounting the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThough historically lightly populated, political Arabia is noted for a high population growth rate \u2013 as the result of both very strong inflows of migrant labor as well as sustained high birth rates. The population tends to be relatively young and heavily skewed gender ratio dominated by males. In many states, the number of South Asians exceeds that of the local citizenry. The four smallest states (by area), which have their entire coastlines on the Persian Gulf, exhibit the world's most extreme population growth, roughly tripling every 20 years. In 2014, the estimated population of the Arabian Peninsula was 77,983,936 (including expatriates). The Arabian Peninsula is known for having one of the most uneven adult sex ratios in the world with females in some regions (especially the east) constituting only a quarter of vicenarians and tricenarians.\n\n\n==== Cities ====\nThe ten most populous cities on the Arabian Peninsula are:\n\n\n=== Landscape ===\n\nGeologically, this region is perhaps more appropriately called the Arabian subcontinent because it lies on a tectonic plate of its own, the Arabian Plate, which has been moving incrementally away from the rest of Africa (forming the Red Sea) and north, toward Asia, into the Eurasian Plate (forming the Zagros Mountains). The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the Arabian-Nubian Shield near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved ophiolite on Earth, the Semail Ophiolite, lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.\nThe peninsula consists of:\n\nA central plateau, the Najd, with fertile valleys and pastures used for the grazing of sheep and other livestock\nA range of deserts: the Nefud in the north, which is stony; the Rub' al Khali or Great Arabian Desert in the south, with sand estimated to extend 600 ft (180 m) below the surface; between them, the Dahna\nMountains\nStretches of dry or marshy coastland with coral reefs on the Red Sea side (Tihamah)\nOases and marshy coast-land in Eastern Arabia on the Persian Gulf side, the most important of which are those of Al Ain (in the UAE, on the border with Oman) and Al-Hasa (in Saudi Arabia), according to one authorArabia has few lakes or permanent rivers. Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called wadis, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient aquifers exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, oases form (e.g. Al-Hasa and Qatif, two of the world's largest oases) and permit agriculture, especially palm trees, which allowed the peninsula to produce more dates than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and arid, although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\nAccording to NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a University of California, Irvine (UCI)-led study published in Water Resources Research on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the Arabian Aquifer System, upon which more than 60 million people depend for water. Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".A plateau more than 2,500 feet (760 m) high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula. The plateau slopes eastwards from the massive, rifted escarpment along the coast of the Red Sea, to the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The interior is characterised by cuestas and valleys, drained by a system of wadis. A crescent of sand and gravel deserts lies to the east.\n\n\n==== Mountains ====\n\nThere are mountains at the eastern, southern and northwestern borders of the peninsula. Broadly, the ranges can be grouped as follows:\n\nNortheast: The Hajar range, shared by the UAE and northern Oman\nSoutheast: The Dhofar Mountains of southern Oman, contiguous with the eastern Yemeni Hadhramaut\nWest: Bordering the eastern coast of the Red Sea are the Sarawat, which can be seen to include the Haraz Mountains of eastern Yemen, and the 'Asir and Hijaz Mountains of western Saudi Arabia, the latter including the Midian in northwestern Saudi Arabia\nNorthwest: Aside from the Sarawat, the northern portion of Saudi Arabia hosts the Shammar Mountains, which include the Aja and Salma subranges\nCentral: The Najd hosts the Tuwaiq Escarpment or Tuwair rangeFrom the Hejaz southwards, the mountains show a steady increase in altitude westward as they get nearer to Yemen, and the highest peaks and ranges are all located in Yemen. The highest, Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb or Jabal Hadhur of the Haraz subrange of the Sarawat range, is about 3,666 m (2.278 mi) high. By comparison, the Tuwayr, Shammar and Dhofar generally do not exceed 1,000 m (0.62 mi) in height.Not all mountains in the peninsula are visibly within ranges. Jebel Hafeet in particular, on the border of the UAE and Oman, measuring between 1,100 and 1,300 m (3,600 and 4,300 ft), is not within the Hajar range, but may be considered an outlier of that range.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Land and sea ===\n\nMost of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making irrigation and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the Persian Gulf, mostly caused by phosphate water pollution and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.The fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at 10,000 feet (3,000 m). In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and khat cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the area was known as Arabia or Aravia (Greek: \u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1). The Romans named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n\nArabia Petraea: for the area that is today southern modern Syria, Jordan, the Sinai Peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia. It was the only one that became a province, with Petra as its capital.\nArabia Deserta (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in Charles M. Doughty's Travels in Arabia Deserta (1888).\nArabia Felix (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now Yemen, which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.The Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.The Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks). The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from Cilicia, where the Euphrates river makes its descent into Syria, through Palestine, and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.The provinces of Arabia were: Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago. However, a Homo sapiens fossilized finger bone was found at Al Wusta in the Nefud Desert, which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago. Nevertheless, the stone tools from the Middle Paleolithic age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago. Acheulean tools found in Saffaqah, Riyadh Region reveal that hominins lived in the Arabian Peninsula as recently as 188,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Pre-Islamic Arabia ===\n\nThere is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to about 106,000 to 130,000 years ago. The harsh climate historically prevented much settlement in the pre-Islamic Arabian peninsula, apart from a small number of urban trading settlements, such as Mecca and Medina, located in the Hejaz in the west of the peninsula.Archaeology has revealed the existence of many civilizations in pre-Islamic Arabia (such as the Thamud), especially in South Arabia. South Arabian civilizations include the Sheba, the Himyarite Kingdom, the Kingdom of Awsan, the Kingdom of Ma'\u012bn and the Sabaean Kingdom. Central Arabia was the location of the Kingdom of Kindah in the 4th, 5th and early 6th centuries AD. Eastern Arabia was home to the Dilmun civilization. The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.The Arabian peninsula has long been accepted as the original Urheimat of the Semitic languages by a majority of scholars.\n\n\n=== Rise of Islam ===\n\nThe seventh century saw the rise of Islam as the peninsula's dominant religion. The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but migrated to Medina in 622. From there he and his companions united the tribes of Arabia under the banner of Islam and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest Indian subcontinent, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees.\nWith Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the Ridda wars, or \"Wars of Apostasy\".Following Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr became leader of the Muslims as the first Caliph. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the Ridda wars, or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the Byzantine Empire. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by Umar as caliph, followed by Uthman ibn al-Affan and Ali ibn Abi Talib. The period of these first four caliphs is known as al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn: the Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their Umayyad successors, the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the Byzantine army and destroyed the Persian Empire, conquering huge swathes of territory from the Iberian peninsula to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.Nevertheless, Mecca and Medina remained the spiritually most important places in the Muslim world. The Qur'an requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the five pillars of Islam, to make a pilgrimage, or Hajj, to Mecca during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime. The Masjid al-Haram (the Grand Mosque) in Mecca is the location of the Kaaba, Islam's holiest site, and the Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet's Mosque) in Medina is the location of Muhammad tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, Mecca and Medina became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the Islamic world.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nDespite its spiritual importance, in political terms Arabia soon became a peripheral region of the Islamic world, in which the most important medieval Islamic states were based at various times in such far away cities as Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo.\nHowever, from the 10th century (and, in fact, until the 20th century) the Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca maintained a state in the most developed part of the region, the Hejaz. Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of Mecca and Medina but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the Hejaz. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the Hejaz, they were usually subject to the suzerainty of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the Abbasids of Baghdad, and the Fatimids, Ayyubids and Mamluks of Egypt.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in Syria, which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon (Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate). It was put in charge of Syria, Cilicia, Iraq, and the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula. The Ottomans never had any control over central Arabia, also known as the Najd region.\nThe Damascus Protocol of 1914 provides an illustration of the regional relationships. Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of Hejaz, asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised Cilicia \u2013 \u0130skenderun and Mersin, Iraq with Kuwait, Syria, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Jordan, and Palestine.In the modern era, the term bilad al-Yaman came to refer specifically to the southwestern parts of the peninsula. Arab geographers started to refer to the whole peninsula as 'jazirat al-Arab', or the peninsula of the Arabs.\n\n\n==== Late Ottoman rule and the Hejaz Railway ====\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project: the construction of a railway connecting Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Islamic Caliphate, and Hejaz with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the Hajj. Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\nThe Hejaz Railway was a narrow gauge railway (1,050 km (650 mi)) that ran from Damascus to Medina, through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of Mecca, but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the Ottoman railway network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal).\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II and was built largely by the Turks, with German advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a waqf, an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.\n\n\n==== The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia ====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the Arab Revolt during World War I and the subsequent collapse and partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the Sherif Hussein ibn Ali with the aim of securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Empire and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\nThese events were followed by the foundation of Saudi Arabia under King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured Riyadh. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, Jabal Shammar, Hejaz between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis absorbed the Emirate of Asir, with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a war with Yemen. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n\n==== Oil reserves ====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of Yemen.\n\n\n==== Civil war in Yemen ====\nThe North Yemen Civil War was fought in North Yemen between royalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and factions of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a coup d'\u00e9tat carried out by the republican leader, Abdullah as-Sallal, which dethroned the newly crowned Muhammad al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border and rallied popular support.\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by Egypt and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\nBy 1970, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their Vietnam.\n\n\n==== Gulf War ====\nIn 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces led to the 1990\u201391 Gulf War. Egypt, Qatar, Syria and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called \"Damascus Declaration\" formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.\n\n\n==== Yemen Arab Spring ====\nThe Arab Spring reached Yemen in January 2011.People of Yemen took to the street demonstrating against three decades of rule by President Ali Abdullah Saleh.The demonstration lead to cracks  in the ruling General Peoples Congress (GPC) and Saleh's Sanhani  clan. Saleh used tactic of concession and violence to save his presidency.After numerous attempt Saleh accepted the Gulf Cooperation Council mediation. He eventually handed power to Vice President Hadi. He was sworn in as President of Yemen on 25 February 2012. He launched a national dialogue to address new constitution, political and social issues.\nSaudi Arabia launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015. The famine in Yemen is the direct result of the military intervention and blockade of Yemen.\n\n\n== Transport and industry ==\nThe extraction and refining of oil and gas are the major industrial activities in the Arabian Peninsula. The region also has an active construction sector, with many cities reflecting the wealth generated by the oil industry. The service sector is dominated by financial and technical institutions, which, like the construction sector, mainly serve the oil industry. Traditional handicrafts such as carpet-weaving are found in rural areas of Arabia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTravels in Arabia, 1892\nHigh resolution scan of old map of Arabia\nThe Coast of Arabia the Red Sea, and Persian Sea of Bassora Past the Straits of Hormuz to India, Gujarat and Cape Comorin from the World Digital Library, depicts a map from 1707.\nWahab, Robert Alexander; Thatcher, Griffithes Wheeler; Goeje, Michael Jan de (1911). \"Arabia\" .

        "wiki": "The Tijuca Forest (Portuguese: Floresta da Tijuca) is a tropical rainforest in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is claimed to be the world's largest urban forest, covering some 32 km\u00b2 (12.4 mi\u00b2), although there are sources assigning this title to the urban forest of Johannesburg, South Africa, where between 6 and 9.5 million trees were planted.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe forest shares its name with bairros or neighborhoods of Tijuca and Barra da Tijuca that contain its entrances. It is located in a mountainous region, which encompasses the Tijuca Massif. The word Tijuca from the Tupi language means marsh, and is a reference to the Tijuca Lagoon in the contemporary Barra da Tijuca. The forest forms a natural boundary that separates the West Zone of the city from the South, Central, and North ones, and the North Zone from the South one.\nThe park is part of the Carioca Mosaic, established in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Tijuca Forest is a man-made reclamation of land around Rio de Janeiro that had previously been cleared and developed to grow sugar and coffee. Replanting was carried out by Major Manuel Gomes Archer in the second half of the 19th century in a successful effort to protect Rio's water supply. This followed concerns made by the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II in 1861 about erosion and deforestation caused by intensive farming, as declining levels of rainfall had already begun affecting the supply of drinking water.\n\nIn 1961, Tijuca Forest was declared a national park. The Forest contains a number of attractions, most notably the colossal sculpture of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado mountain. Other attractions include the Cascatinha Waterfall; the Mayrink Chapel, with murals painted by C\u00e2ndido Portinari; the light pagoda-style gazebo at Vista Chinesa outlook; and the giant granite picnic table called the Mesa do Imperador. Among its impressive peaks is the Stone of G\u00e1vea.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe Tijuca Forest is home to hundreds of species of plants and wildlife, many threatened by extinction, and found only in the Atlantic Rainforest (Mata Atl\u00e2ntica in Portuguese). The vegetation is so dense that scientists have estimated that ambient temperatures in surrounding areas have been lowered by up to 9 \u00b0C. The forest also contains some 30 waterfalls.One favela exists in the Tijuca Forest. Its inhabitants are mainly the descendants of those who migrated to the region in the 1930s to take part in the replanting effort. Though conditions have improved recently under the Favela-Bairro Project, Mata Machado still contributes to environmental degradation in the forest.For trekking, the most common destinations are: Diamantina's waterfall, Parrot's Beak (Bico do Papagaio), Tijuca's Peak (Pico da Tijuca), Cave Circuit (Circuito das Grutas), Archer's hill (Morro do Archer), Anhanguera' hill (Morro da Anhanguera), The Excelsior's lookout (Mirante do Excelsior) and the Bat's cave (Caverna dos Morcegos). \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mammals of Tijuca National Park\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTijuca National Park, Rio de Janeiro - by the Royal Geographical Society's Hidden Journeys project\nVirtual Pic-Tour through the \"jungle\" @ The Rio de Janeiro Photo Guide",

          "Overview You\u2019ll find historical spots, spectacular views, a beautiful waterfall, a small chapel and unusual trees in this dense, tropical national park, probably best explored by jeep tour. Suggested Duration:More than 3 hours Address:\nEstrada da Cascatinha 850 Alto da Boa Vista, Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro 20531-590 BrazilMap ",
          "We had a nice jeep ride without a roof, the guide forgot to warn us that going up the temperature would be low and we were cold but it did us good because we were too hot in Rio",
          "Beautiful national park on outskirts of Rio. 4 wheel drive tour was rather windy and bumby. Lively waterfall. Some great flora and fauna. Not much to see in terms if birds/ amimals. Worth going if you are having a rio only holiday but there are better places to go further",
          "Interesting story about how the forest was formed; it was not \"natural.\" Saw lots of jackfruit trees; splendid waterfall, interesting flowering plants.",
          "lovely rainforest but very few animals. The 4x4 jeep tour made everyone feel sick, even those that don't suffer from motion sickness!",
          "Nice place to walk around, see waterfalls, take nice pictures, enjoy nature, hike and visit with your family. If you go by car is easier because you have parking inside, save your energy to star hike inside.",
          "It is a place suitable for hikes. It is not exactly a park. It is a part of a forest. Walking and relax. Small waterfalls, and exotic flowers. If you have time you can go.",
          "The forest was lush and pretty, but the road was long and bumpy, with many turns. Not comfortable in a Jeep. The Chinese View panorama was special.",
          "We went on a beautiful easy walk with an organized tour through the park. Definitely worth the 1/2 day tour.",
          "Tijuca is a vast national park located on the outskirts of Rio. It is a really stunning sanctuary in which to visit for some respite from the bustling city! There are miles and miles worth of trails to explore and all are circular routes that you can pick and choose according to",
          "Nice park in Rio. It is not overly large. You can either hike in it or drive through it on your way to Christ the Redeemer.",
          "It's really just a forest in a city, with some monkey's, waterfalls and a lot of people everywhere. As the terrain is not easy to walk, I strongly recommend to go there by a car with some tour guide (as he or she will know where to bring you as it's huge). The view of the city",
          "The park is some 39 square kilometers at the back of Rio and is a lush tropical jungle that is seen as you drive up to Christ The Redeemer . Looking back from thre monument you can see the beauty and expanse of the park., which has fortunately been retained",
          "A green tropical canopy amidst the urban jungle of Rio. You have to experience this close-up on the way to the statue of Christ the Redeemer. Note the number of jackfruit trees with fruits hanging of them, in season - this was an unusual sight in South America.",
          "Visit the forest for a small or bigger hike. We took a family hike with Jungle Me. It was great to walk a small part of a trail with a guide to tell us all about the plants and animals. We so quite a lot of wildlife, some nice waterfalls and hardly any other humans.",
          "Enjoyed a drive through the forest on the way to Christ the Redeemer. I could see great vistas through the forest canopy of the city below. I will definitely head out on a forest tour on my next visit to Rio.",
          "You need a car, or tour, the entry of the park is not super walking friendly. There's no wifi in the park or surrounding it, my partner and I had to exit the park and walk to a nearby bar to call a car. I didn't have enough time to thoroughly explore the park! We were walking",
          "We took a 4 hour trip with our guide Victor into this area on our last day in Rio. Spectacular views of the downtown area and a chance to see some wildlife, peaceful waterfalls and lots of green. Very close to the downtown so no real reason not to go if you have the time.",
          "When you think about Rio de Janeiro the beaches come to your mind, never expected to have this large forest near the city. Best if you take a guided tour from Rio de Janeiro on your way to Corcovado Christ. Do not miss the waterfalls, small but very beautiful. Many spots to stop",
          "We visited on the Jeep tour and it was one of the better tours we undertook here. Lost to look , wildlife and scenic views of the city",
          "this trip was so serene. Reasonable rates with C2Rio Tours. has hotel pick up and drop off. Friendly knowledgeable guide. Tranquil drive in this rainforest. Winding roads and beautiful views. \\saw monkeys and beautiful waterfalls.",
          "I love this place. You have many waterfalls, trails, caves, mountains, animals, rocks, Christ, Pedra da G\u00e1vea, Pedra Bonita, Pedra Branca! The best Natural Attraction inside a city in the World! My favorite place in Rio!!!",
          "I spent a day in national park and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is lots to see and some beautiful photo opportunities. The wildlife is amazing and if you are a bird-lover you won't be disappointed here. Keep your eyes peeled high for the toucans feeding and lower for the",
          "The falls are so beautiful that it is worth the time and money. The boat trip it's much too expensive though but with 70 Reali the entrance you have the bus to the falls and you can walk from there.",
          "Beautiful forest at the edge of Rio. We saw capuchin monkeys, toucans, and of course the waterfall. I am sure there is more to see, in the way of wildlife, but would probably need to do some serious hiking.",
          "Lots of hiking trails in the area around Christ the Redeemer and winding roads. Our guide said we might see monkeys and other animals but we did not see any wildlife - just lots of vegetation.",
          "This park is clean with views to see the city. It also holds Christ the Redeemer. It\u2019s well worth the visit. I would suggest going in the morning to avoid extreme heat and crowds. Bring a camera, bring a brunch and stay to enjoy Mother Nature.",
          "If you can't go to the Amazon, enjoy one of Rio's jewels, an authentic tropical forest, nicely preserved in a mountain setting, with ponds, waterfalls, and small animals like monkeys and birds.",
          "You can take some of the tours that take you with special vehicles to visit the place. It is a very nice one, otherwise, you may go on your own, for example by bike and you can go to the Chinese view, where you will have excellent views of the city. You also have places where",
          "We visited here as part of our trip to Corcovado and it was well worth it. Interesting flora everywhere, and some stunning views.",
          "We visit this park on our way to \u201cEl Corcovado\u201d. Is very nice, with beautiful vegetation. Go early if you go during summer, because is very, very hot.",
          "The national park is only a short drive out of Rio. Best to have a driver/guide who can drop you at view points and let you see the views of Rio.",
          "Beautiful break in a city that is less than beautiful. The waterfalls,clean fresh air lush vegetation and history are amazing in this congested busy city.",
          "A breath of fresh air close to the city. Great place to come and relax, enjoy cooler temperatures and close to nature. Good for biking (although steep) and for hiking in the woods. You might even see some animals.",
          "We only intended to see the Chinese view but ended up driving around the park and saw a gorgeous waterfall! This looks like a nice place for a hike or bike ride and is definitely something you should add to your list if you love nature!",
          "We trekked through many of the well-marked trails in the Tijuca rainforest. It was hard to believe the urban city of Rio was just on the other side of the forest. We spent a full day hiking and truly enjoyed the place. Bring water and bug spray.",
          "We spent some time touring the National Park as we were headed with our guide to the Christ the Redeemer Statue. Very peaceful respite in the huge city of Rio. Don't overlook this gem as yo plan your visits in Rio.",
          "There's a very nice waterfall inside the park that's great to visit. The park as a whole is very accessible from the city - great to walk or cycle around, free to enter and has multiple scenic points to get a bird's view of Rio de Janeiro",
          "Entry to the park is free. There are many locals running or cycling through the park. We took a guide and realised when we got there that it wasn't really necessary. There are signs everywhere and if you stay on the paved road you won't get lost. The tracks also have signage but",
          "The park is so large you can best see it all from the air.On the ground there is something new around every cornet",
          "This park is beautiful and rustic with large trees and lots of tropical plants. We did not explore far because of the weather but I would highly recommend it.",
          "We had a guide who took us on a quick hike, then round various points of interest, all within a morning. Worthwhile.",
          "What a great park to have in the middle of such a beautiful city. We hired a bird guide who took us around Tijuca and we saw at least 50 species of birds most of which were new to us. We also saw coati and capuchin monkeys. If you are in Rio and like nature then this is a",
          "I took a stroll into this park and hiked up to Pico da Tijuca. If you make it to the park you have to go to the peak as it has incredible views of everything. There are many different trails and other things to see in the park to so make sure you give yourself a full day to",
          "How lucky people from Rio are to have such a great national park inside of it\u00b4s city! Rio is the most beautiful city I ve ever been!",
          "We enjoyed a hiking tour to the 1000 meter height mountain called \u201ePico de Tijuca\u201c. we needed around 2 hours with start at the visitor center. great expirience!",
          "We went with my family in a jeep tour and it was incredible. It's amazing that just next to the great city you have this incredible rain forrest, full of wild nature. The jeep tour was fine, we visited the typical tourist stops (Chinese view, waterfalls, mason church, short trek",
          "Tijuca National Park is a great reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the city, and if it is a hot humid day, the cool weather in the park is a real treat. You also get good views of the city from the so-called Chinese View, but other than that, it is just a nice forest.",
          "Tijuana have waterfalls, djungle and breathtaking views, fresh cool air and a steep climb, you have to be triathlon- athletic to take a mountain bike up there. Tip! Keep your eyes open especially in the nightfall/ evening and try to get a glimpse of the rare ocelots ( like",
          "Our family really enjoined the Tijuca tour (bec of the scenic spots, the wild animals along the way, the falls, and the overlooking view of the city. Our guide Rafael Caja is a very knowleable and efficient nice guide. I will recommend him to you and my other friends.",
          "One of the largest urban forest areas in the world. enjoy the monkeys, sloths and birds. You will see some of it already when going up to see the Christ the Redeemer statue, but to do it justice, book a jungle tour through it. Amazing site!",
          "The Park is essentially a rain forest. It is beautiful, and a trip through it is worthwhile. There is a nice drive around the Park, and convenient places to stop for pictures.",
          "The lookout from here is not comparable to what we saw from the Christ statue, especially with the feeling of being in the jungle. The place is perfect to do canyoning, but there was no option, we came here by jeep. The hike was nice, Jose did an excellent job and gave us enough",
          "What an amazing place. Worth the trip 100%. Our guide spoke great English and has loads of facts about the forest. One being that you\u2019ll get 4 years in prison if cutting down a tree from the forest! Worth the journey 100%",
          "Its a forest/park in the middle of the city but there is a park in the middle of NYC too. hehe Tijuca park is really big so i would recommend going there with a tour group which will take you to Chinese viewpoint and also to the falls in the park.",
          "Such a wonderful experience to have a National Park bang in the middle of the city! We saw the water fall and the Chinese View , but more than anything driving through the park was truly lovely!",
          "Went on a local holiday so the roads were jammed. I would recommend going on a non holiday week day. Beautiful natural scenery, waterfalls places to take a dip in fressh clean water and great panoramic views.",
          "We went here with a tour. There are many steep and winding roads so I\u2019m happy to not be driving. Some roads are one-way and 2 cars were going the wrong way! I saw a toucan and blue morph butterflies. There\u2019s a waterfall that is tall but for me not impressive as we just came",
          "Don't bother trekking! Unless you have the energy and patience. It took us 6 hours up and down. We decided to do it ourselves and towards the end we were totally exhausted and desperate for a Taxi as the walk down seemed endless. Eventually after 2 hours of further waling, we",
          "Hey you must stop by here bring plenty of water for your hike,plenty to see, dress for hiking,sunscreen,bug spray, ect.",
          "Went to the park for a couple of hours on a Monday morning and we saw monkeys. The waterfall was amazing too. Definitely worth checking out if you have time in Rio.",
          "After visiting the hang gliding platform close to the parking lot, it was a pretty easy trek to the top. The views from the top were indeed BONITA, and we saw monkeys and wildlife along the way. Warning!!!! DO NOT BRING MONEY OR ANY VALUABLES ( Phones) as we were stopped on",
          "Fantastic for walks, road cycling and mountain biking. Also lots of picnic areas. The visitor centre has lots of interesting information (with many in English). Full of both locals and tourists but not overcrowded. You can spend as much or as little time here as you like",
          "This is the worlds biggest urban green space and it is amazing the plants wildlife you can see and hear it\u2019s so lovely when Rio is so busy",
          "Birding in Rio after a cruise My wife, Sheila, and I are Senior Birders from Toronto. I am the avid birder, but my wife likes to come along and see the birds and their different habitats. My Life List is over 2,250 species, having birded in many countries around the world. We",
          "The extent of the forest was huge and unexpected so close to the city. Lovely to see the locals using the falls to swim. It was good to have visited as part of a tour because the guide can point out more. Worth a visit so long as the weather is dry.",
          "Lots to see in this park including beautiful waterfalls. It was a very hot day, so we mostly saw the park from the car.",
          "Really not to be missed! There are a lot of different treks/hikes you can do in Tijuca, to suit all fitness levels and ages. Went for a little hike and ended up at an amazing lookout with views of the city and a direct aspect of Pedra Bonita. The park is amazing,",
          "A great area of natural beauty & waterfall to walk about in & relax. Away from the maddling crowds of the beaches, city and noise you will find peace & a feeling of serenity here as a change from the tourist hot spots.",
          "Visited the Tijuca Rainforest with a birdguide - it is a great place to go but unfortunately for us is did rain very heavily for most of our time there. Check the weather before you go.",
          "The Chinesse view from Tijuca is really the best view. It has it all: the ocean, the mountains, the valleys, the amazing trees, the sky, the birds, and the Ciudad Maravillosa at the bottom. What more can you expect from a view? It really is THE postcard view!!!",
          "Because of the tourism company that I used, I drove through the National Park almost everyday of my one week trip. The Park is amazing, despite it\u2019s history. I enjoyed the view from Chinese Point, and found the Emperor\u2019s Table to be pretty interesting as well.",
          "We took a Tijuca Jeep tour set up through our hotel and it was super fun. They took us for A\u00e7ai juice, and stopped at a bunch of amazing lookouts and waterfalls for pictures. My kids enjoyed it and the guides were great. Would recommend doing the Jeep tour.",
          "The trail for Pico da Tijuca is easy and felt safe to get to solo as an American with zero language skills. Beautiful jungle hike capped with a steep stairs with chains to the top. I would call this a hidden gem for foreigners. The view from the top is incredible!",
          "Loved it! Some of the views were just as impressive as from Christ the redeemer or sugarloaf. Nice place to spend some time when in Rio.",
          "Took a tour to tijuca forest. Our tour guide filipe was the best. I would recommend getting in touch with him before anyone else. Knowledgeable, funny and acommodating . Check him up at Rio off the path tours",

          "Hiked pedra de GAvea you have to enter park to do so. I felt safe even thoe I've read reviews of people saying it might be dangerous. Take bug spray and sunblock as it gets hot.",
          "Went to the Chinese view and walked to the waterfalls. I know we went by car but I don't remember from what entrance we entered. Be mindful of your belongings left in the car. Bring mosquito repellent and leave before it gets dark. Beautiful sights and felt like in the Amazon",
          "Lots of trails and Peaks to visit, but find specialized guides. Always walk in groups and avoid carrying lots of money, expensive watches ... sports suits for walks. Unfortunately political instability reflects on public safety.",
          "A beautiful experience within nature yet a little artificial. Good to see but not a must a little like the rest of the fauna of the area.",
          "If you are in RiO, must take a full morning to enjoy at all - and being fast; .. I wish I had to spend the afternoon on Botanic Garden, if you have, (3-4) enjoy and spend the other days on the \"Basic\"...",
          "The Tijuca National park is a perfect place for people who love the nature and the wild life! The park is placed right in the heart of the city of Rio and is absolut easyly to get there! You will find great waterfalls, rivers, trees, monkeys and all the experience that a day on",
          "As this is the largest urban forest in the world. A tour will show you the usual stuff like trials an waterfalls. It should be high on your list of experiences. We combined it with a trip to Santa Teresa also for safety.",
          "we were lucky enough to be taken here by our personal guide olivia Alves and upon visiting on a Monday we were the only ones here. If you like nature then its worth whilst visiting here. Serene location.",
          "We visited as part of tour and saw the waterfall and all the viewpoints. Unfortunately it was very cloudy and we couldn't make use of the great views, really need to spend the day there to go through all the trails and go for a dip in a waterfall.",
          "I rented a bike to climb the Vista Chinese, which is located in this national park. It was an amazing experience. Occasionally there was a car or another cyclist, but most of the times it was completely silent, except for some animal sounds (mostly birds and insects). Normally",
          "Tijuca is beautiful. I took the JungleMe tour to Pico de Tijuca and it was fantastic. The plants and trees were nice, the views were great, and it was all in the middle of the city. Nice waterfalls too.",

          "We did go up to this national park but the high light was see where the hang gliders take off. That was awesome. We have nice national parks in Australia so nothing new there.",
          "Visited the historic chapel (1850s) that is still used for services. Beautiful rain forest near Rio de Janerio. Lush greenery. River. Waterfalls. Hugh trees with fruit as large as watermelons.",
          "My husband and I booked a private Jeep tour though our hotel and we're so happy to have done this tour. Our tour guide was amazing! He stopped at all the major sights, we took plenty of photos, went on a hike / climb where at the top we entered a cave and stopped at the Chinese",
          "The park is beautiful and has great views from the top and other levels. You can see all of Rio including the beaches and favelas. Christ the Redeemer is at the top. I took a tour that offered early access being the first group up to the statue. It was really cloudy and we",
          "This National Park is easily accessible and hosts a variety of trees, plants, animals and birds. The views from lookouts such as the Vista Chinesa is lovely.",
          "Our tour guide Manu Peclat (See my review of him) took us here on our tour thru Rio. It is really a beautiful place with a lot of great photo opportunities. I highly recommend.",
          "We booked a jungle tour for half a day. Experiencing the jungle is nice, the guide 's English was very good, and the trip was very informative, but we were mostly in the jeep and just had a small walk through close to the main road. We saw no animals. So it was hardly a jungle",
          "Amazing natural beauty, waterfalls, monkeys, turtles and fresh clean air. Amazing day and highly recommended",
          "A very unique forest, with a story to tell. Peaceful and calm views. A contrast to the city below. Beautiful scenery , fresh and green.",
          "If you have an extra few hours during your visit, I would recommend a visit to the Park. Important that you have a good guide and a tour company that specializes in Tijuca National Park. The vegetation gives you a sense for the various kinds of flora and fauna present in a",
          "A few waterfalls, small museum, and lots of flora. But if it's at all cloudy, you'll miss the the views of Rio. It's a long drive up and back from the city so you should allow at least 3-4 hours for a tour.",
          "We did this as part of the Big Dude Tour and saw enough to satisfy our curiosity. The park is beautiful and if we were coming back to Rio, I would plan to spend more time here. Easy to do on your own if you have transportation.",
          "This tropical park starts in the city of Rio de Janeiro and spreads out over Gavea high up. Dont miss the Vista Chinesa. If you are in shape do it by bike, stunning views",
          "Lovely to see but the roads are very twisty. was busy when we were there but and enjoyable visit if u have extra time",
          "With monkeys roaming freely, many scenic view points, including the Chinese vista, and an abundance of flora and fauna, this park seems so far removed from the city of Rio.",
          "Took an amazing train ride up to the tope and back down. Very beautiful scenery. Weather was obviously a little cooler as we went up the mountain. I recommend using a guide as it can be hard to get tickets.",
          "Very fun and picturesque. I enjoyed seeing the park from many vantage points. I saw some great overlooks, the waterfall of course right by the road, and more. Serene and picturesque. More tropical than what I am of course used to in Colorado where I live, still a great chance",
          "This forest is Rio's secret treasure. A great place to visit to escape the city. Do ensure you visit \"The Chinese Vista\" for the very best photo of Rio. here you can capture Christ the Redeemer, Sugar Loaf Mountain, The city, The Favelas, The beaches all in one photo.",

          "Another must see location in the city, or at least the hills surrounding it. Promoted as the largest urban rain forest park in the world and it is as distant in feelfrom the city as you could imagine, a place of tranquility. Plenty of wildlife to be seen and experienced.",
          "Went tracking with the boys . Was a easy way up even got my special needs child . Boys had so much fun and we showered at one of the waterfalls which was a exotic experience.",
          "Wow. This is an incredible park in the middle of a large city. The drive through it was beautiful. We were sorry we could not spend more time and enjoy a hike or two or picnic.",
          "Very nice natural jungle park near the Rio city. Possible to feel and see jungle environment. Climate is similar to tropical jungle climate.",
          "We visited this place to give our skin some much needed rest from the sun. We decided to forgo a guided tour and check out the park on our own. The drive with the taxi to the visitor's center from Copacabana cost about 65 reais. At the center you can get a map of the trails",
          "The park is located waiting the limits of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The vegetation is quite thick and offers a bit of respite from the heat of the lower elevation. The park claims there is much to see with it's fauna and flora. I was somewhat disappointed. I did not see an",
          "A national park in the middle of a city is a nice diversion, both relaxing and beautiful. But it also can be a bit of an afterthought after you've seen the Amazon rainforests or others like it. You may be lucky enough to see a few colorful birds or even some monkeys but you've",
          "Don't miss this tour because we have an Atlantic forest fully recovered within the urban area of the city of Rio de Janeiro. There are several attractions such as natural springs, trails, climbing, gardens, picnic areas, waterfalls, lakes and a fauna and flora exuberant and with",
          "Amazing nature with clean hiking trails. It is close to the city and a great escape from dirty and hot Rio. You can hear birds and see waterfalls. The restaurant inside was closed in the middle of the day. The people at the tourist info do nor speak English, or any other",
          "If you'd like to escape from the hustle and bustle of Rio de janeiro for a while without leaving the city, I recommend Tijuca National Park, or as it's better known here, a Floresta de Tijuca. Various busroutes leaving the center of the city will take you here and you can walk",
          "Totally a must see place, every one should go there, by car, by bike, by foot...Trails, waterfalls, caves, jungle, animals and much more!!",
          "This park is very close to Rio and about 30 min ride from the city. It is one of the biggest national park so close. Trails are good and nicely marked. Worth spending little time for nature lovers",
          "Lots of hiking opportunities, but our time limited us to a tour by car. Lots to see, including the \"Chinese view\" and a high waterfall. Others report seeing troops of monkeys, but our wildlife was limited to witnessing a coati rooting through trash bins.",
          "A must see. A quiet forest with giant trees and capuchin monkeys, with splashing waterfalls and viewpoints that will take your breath away. Engage a guide who will drive you there and show you the best spots. I recommend Rio Active Tours guide (details on Tripadvisor).",
          "A must for rio. just rent a car and get lost in the winding strees and enjoy the lush vegetation everywhere. A paradise !",
          "We booked with Rio Maximo and had a great experience with Adriano. He is knowledgeable about the flora and fauna in the park and went above and beyond to ensure that all guests enjoyed the experience to the utmost. It is refreshing when a tour guide NEVER makes even the",
          "We took a taxi to Vista Chinesa and then hiked upwards following the Yellow Boot to Mesa do Imperador, where we were followed by a clan of aggressive and hungry monkeys. We gave them some bananas in exchange for photos... fair trade. From there we went up higher to Morro do",
          "a part in a city! stunning and amazing. if you are only a short time in Rio then see it on the way the statue of Christ. if you manage to stay longer in the city, spend a whole day there. relaxing but stunning.",
          "There are not many cities in the world than can have a tropical forest within their city limits and Rio has it. The forest itself is a pleasant visit but as it leads to Christ the redentor it makes it a must do visit. If you can spend some time it is great",
          "A \"must-see\" place due to the great views of Rio. Best to go with a guide who can tell you about the history of the place. Be sure to go on a clear day, on a cloudy day you'll miss the view",
          "From any part of the city you see the mountains that are part of the National Park. Good for running, riding bikes, or walking. You can take children with you, if they can walk for at least 40 minutes going up. It's possible to enter the forest with cars, but I would recommend",
          "We drove here with a guide that lives in the area and although it has some beautiful vista's it was not what we expected. We did do one short trail but it seemed that the best way to see the park is to just drive on the road. There was little to see in the way of wildlife,",
          "Enjoyed visitng Tijuca National park while in Rio.It is a peaceful and tranquil place right in the city.There are many species of plants ,birds etc to view.The view of Rio from chinese pavellion is great.We went in a car to different vewing areas but can hike also .",
          "Took an organised Jeep tour via hotel and it was worth it. Amazing to learn the history of the area. Great tour guide engaged us all. Stunning waterfalls and such clean air.",
          "One of my favorite tours in Rio. The biggest urban forest in the world offers the visitors a time of peaceful and breathtaking view of the wonderful city.",
          "Tijuca National Park is also a must place while you're in Rio de Janeiro. The park keeps a large variety of exotic plants and many of them are from the Brazil Imperial Era.",
          "We booked a half-day rainforest tour with Grayline tours through Viator. The pick up details were a little vague so we asked our hotel to ring to confirm these. Our guide David was excellent, very enthusiastic and knowledgable. The tour included a stop at the Chinese View, a",
          "In Rio there is so much to do and seeing the Tijuca forest is a must. The forest is filled with native plants even though it was reforested in the 1860's",
          "Very green and untouched, although so close to the city. The trees drown out all signs of the city being so near. The park is well worth the trip away from the beached for the day.",
          "Just beatifull. A paradise within a huge but beautifull city. Enjoy the tropical nature. Do not muss it if you have more than three days n Rio",
          "Beautiful park in the city. Take the train up through the forest to see the statue of Christ. Incredible!!",
          "we went with Amigo Tours for our Tijuca Natl Park visit and we saw more than what we expected. we visited the waterfalls first. we also saw and took pictures at the pink chapel. we stopped by the lonely bridge too. it was very minimal walking; our tour guide drove us between the",
          "Floresta da Tijuca is the largest urban jungle in he world. Hundreds of species and endless greenery lie within and the views perched above Rio are spectacular.",
          "The largest urban forest in the world - it's incredible. So extensive and properly 'jungly', it's hard to believe you're still in the city. On a good day the views are amazing from the Vista Chinesa. A must for cyclists too.",
          "I was so looking forward to visiting this park after hearing about the rainforest and waterfalls. I've visited rainforests elsewhere and maybe if you haven't seen them before this park would be fine. I tend to compare rainforests and waterfalls with the best I've seen so far,",
          "I have been through a couple of times. The last was with a guide for photography. This area is not remote South America !! It is your middle to upper class Local Rio resident cycling, walking area... Very busy on the weekends. Worth a stroll to be with nature. Did see Toucans",
          "This was beautiful, but a little disappointed that there were no birds. Our Guide Gabriel and Driver Maria were very patient while we took lots of photographs",
          "This urban rainforest, Parque Nacional da Tijuca, is the world's largest urban park covering 15 square miles and containing countless species of plants and animals, waterfalls and springs, trails , walks and the magestic Corcovado mountain topped by the iconic Cristo Redentor",
          "We took a taxi to the tijuca in search of the waterfalls that we had seen and read about however the first one was as you entered but the guard told us we couldn't stop in the taxi so we proceeded to drive around only having to do a loop and go back there again this time we were",
          "This is a nice cool ride up the Tijuca Rain Forest mountain: my ears popped twice! It was the rainy season (August 2016, during the Olympics), I had on sweater, and I needed it. Our guide pointed out monkeys playing & sleeping in the trees. On the way up, we stopped at",
          "You can see this from SugarLoaf and from the Christ, but you should also take a car ride through the forest. See the Chinese Pagoda view and if a lot of people are stopped by the side of the road, they are probably watching some monkeys. Stop and take pictures, but don't try",
          "Visited the park with our guide Carlos Brandt (great guide by the way!) and walked through the paths briefly and saw this lovely waterfall.",
          "When we went there did not seem to be many tourists - we did see a monkey in the park and some waterfalls, which were very pretty",
          "A fantastic wild bush forest in the centre of Rio. There are slightly crappy maps at the entrances to the park- but the routes I've walked were both well way marked. Check other local hiking websites to bolster your knowledge before heading out. If you're making for the fab",
          "Unfortunately most Brazilians don't care too much about nature, but if you have time, take a car or taxi up the hill and do one of the trails. In the weekends it's a bit more busy, but during the week it's mostly nice and quiet, you can spot all sorts of animals if you are quiet",
          "Went into this area when visiting Christ the redeemer. Wish we had time to bike tours. Great Forrest and lots of water falls. Lots of trails and walks available. Definitely worth a visit",
          "A beautiful urban park with waterfalls, interesting wildlife and some historic houses. We did it with a guide who was very knowledgable about its history and features, which I suspect is much better than doing it on one's own.",
          "Picked up in Copacabama by the guide. Metro then bus ride, interesting adventure in itself. Gentle stroll for nearly three hours and 5 miles. Wildlife a bit scarce but very quiet compared with Rio. We thought we'd booked a jeep ride but the selections are a bit confused on the",
          "Tired of the crowds and heat? The Tijuca National Park is the best place to get away from all of that. Hiking to the top of the Pico da Tijuca is a must! For those who rock climb, there are some great vias here to explore. Be sure that you are traveling in a group and I",
          "A quick and easy get away in the city. Lots of people walk up to the Chinese vista. It's green and cool, with a phenomenal view of the city at the top. And, monkeys!!",
          "One of my absolute favourite things about Rio de Janeiro is the sheer amount of contrast you get between urban city and beautiful nature and scenery. Took a tour with a couple of friends in which we got a bus to Tijuca National Park and then did a short hike lasting",
          "If you have enough time in your trip to spend half day walking, this is the right option. Wild nature just beside a crowded city. Lot of things to see.",
          "Grab the shuttle from Copacabana beach and ride straight up. The shuttles are new and the experience is memorable. Highly recommended.",
          "Dense jungle (reforested efforts a decade or more ago- 19k sq miles- the largest in an urban area). We didn't see any monkeys but allegedly possible. The falls even during the dry winter season was flowing nicely. The Tauney falls is next to the parking lot so easy walk for",
          "We visited the park as part of a tour and it was amazing! Such beauty in the middle of a large city. We stopped at a trail and took a small hike which was fun and then of course stopped at the waterfall. On the way out, we saw a little monkey high in a tree. Don't go expecting",
          "If you love hiking, exploring and experiencing nature then this for you. Peaceful, lush plant life and see capuchin monkeys in their natural habit in the treetops. Always cooler under the canopy so a welcome break from the heat. Be sure to wear decent footwear to cope with the",
          "This was a refreshing getaway and because of the altitude and foliage its actually cooler in the park than it is in the city. Very beautiful- make sure to have a guide to explain the process of how they preserved this park and what types of plants and animals inhibit the park.",
          "Much like Central Park in New York, this is the perfect place to escape for those of us who crave nature. We took a 30 minute walk to a beautiful waterfall. There's much more to do here, but for us, it was a little pitstop between Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf.",
          "It is impressive how nature is included in the city life of Rio. In half an hour we were standing in the middle of a forest. We saw some monkeys and special birds and got to swim near a waterfall. Rio de Janeiro is just an amazing city.",
          "We were fortunate to join a group hiking. Tijuca is it's own little oasis of peacefulness. For adventuresome people, there are also caves to hike through. If you have time, it's great for a half day adventure.",
          "We incorporated a visit to the forest (planted by humans) as part of a day trip to Corcovado. Best way to see/experience it is on the tramway through the forest to the top. If you are visiting Corcovada include this forest experience.",
          "Tijuca forest is wonderful. It has a little bit of everything you would find in the jungle, including wonderful waterfalls. There is also a restaurant, Os Esquilos, that serves rather good food. A very interesting place to visit even though you don't eat there.",
          "Enjoy the park with a guided tour by Jungle Me - it was a fun way to experience the park and get some exercise too.",
          "Make sure you have plenty of time to see this. Unlike some of the other locations this place requires at least half of a day to really see it.",
          "We did a jeep tour with this one. It was absolutely awful. We drove around for several hours and never even got out of the truck.... Make sure you find a tour where you actually get to hike or walk around. This one was a waste of our day....",
          "Travelling with two kids, we love spending some time walking in the forest and watching local wildlife... you can go by car, park inside the national park, and stop at some spots to have a walk... what a shame that the restaurants were closed :-(",
          "We went looking for sloths, but did not find any. However, the waterfall was beautiful and the flowers and vines enormous.",
          "Fantastic park. Can you imagine a tropical forest within 10 minutes from your hotel? That's all about this park. Lots of trails with different difficulty levels are available. Definitely a must visit place during your days in Rio.",
          "One of the best place in Rio de Janeiro. Amazing rain forest, waterfalls, lakes, areas for pic nic and many other things to do with your family or your friends or for couples.",
          "We took an uber by ourselves and walked on one of the trails- spent about 5 hours walking. Enjoyed it so much- you MUST GO!\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Only had time to drive up through the forest. Areas to pull over and enjoy the view of the city. Found a monkey eating a strawberry adorable. Bikers everywhere on the mountain, be careful driving!",
          "Did a driving tour through the forest. Stopped at waterfalls, Chinese Overlook, saw some coati, butterflies, marmosets (I think that's what they were - they were fast). We stopped a few times for the scenic overlook. Took about two hours through and would have liked to stayed",
          "Went here as part of a tour. it was ok. Maybe there was not enough time but it was just average. I have seen better rain forests. There just was not much to it really",
          "For some paths no guide is needed (following the road) others light or moderate should be guided by experienced guides. I usually go with Trilhas do Rio de Janeiro.",
          "Tijuca National Park is free to the public, and has several different trails for people to walk on, with information at various points. There are several car parks and there is a designated place for a barbecue or picnic. The sights at the top are beautiful and although",
          "We went with a jeep tour on one raining day. We saw the rainforest and a waterfall but no animals were sighted. Near the end of the trip, we saw a Chinese pavilion.",
          "One of the most exuberant forests I've ever seen, with hundreds of forest species, all kind of animals and an astonishing type of butterflies with blue cobalt wings...",
          "It's not everywhere in the world you can visit a huge city with a national park. It is actually the biggest urban park in the world. As it is peculiar in Rio de Janeiro, there are many mountains. So, if you are the athletic type, you can choose within the many options for",
          "We went on a rainforest tour. Due to the time of year we didn't get to see hardly any wildlife (only 2 monkeys). It was chilly during this month (65-70 degrees) so definitely take a jacket. The views of the city and waterfalls were beautiful.",
          "One of the amazing things of Rio is its nature. The beaches, the lagoons, the hill, and as well its rainforest. We went by ourselves and walked for more than 2 hours through the park. Really brilliant.",
          "Excellent experience. We visited the Parque Florestal portion of the park and hiked to the top of Pico da Tijuca and in my opinion, this was the best view of Rio. It was even better than the views from Sugarloaf and Christ the Redeemer. The hike up was easy and beautiful as",
          "Great driving around and seeing the multiple views. The waterfall was cool. We dropped from there to the beaches were the para sailers landed so was cool watching them jump and land.",
          "We booked to do a combo tour with Rio adventure company. Our tour guide took us into the heart of the park and stopped along the way for all the photo opportunities. We were not warned we would be hiking up the hill until we actually started. Although the trek was hard work the",
          "On September 8, 2015, I had the pleasure of birding the tropical forests close to downtown Rio. My guide was Ricardo Barbosa who speaks excellent English and is very familiar with the birdlife of the Park, including the calls and songs of the birds, since that is how he found",
          "Let's start saying this is a moderate intensity hiking experience that last about 3.5-4 hours.... Definitely not for beginners... You don't need any tour guide to hike to the Pico da Tijuca... Everything is well signaled on your way up, you won't get lost. Plus, there are",
          "Very enjoyable hike on the trail. Excellent views at the summit of Pedro Bonita. Some areas can be quite steep.",
          "We took a jeep tour into the park and appreciated the lack of a roof. The forest is tropical but we did not see many birds or animals, even during a couple of walks into it. The Taunay waterfall was beautiful and also provided most of the wildlife viewing: coatis and a",
          "There is so much to do in the forest. We did a whole day tour, hiked up the Pedra Bonita, stopped at the Chinese Vista and also took a dip in one of the waterfalls. An excellent day.",
          "We took Jeep Tour for this. It was great. did some trekking, saw nice fall that sort of like the one in Puerto Rico rain forest.",
          "Great day trip trek in Tijuca (go with a guide) there are also jeep tours to Tijuca Floresta waterfalls and amazing views of Rio de Janeiro",
          "Took a private van tour of the forest. It is amazing this area has been kept natural in this overly crowded city so it was a great escape for the day. Wish people would not throw trash in the woods and the streams or write graffiti on the walls.",
          "We took a guided tour in an open jeep. The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent english. He took us inside some and took us on hike on some trails which most tours do not do. It was a very quiet and peaceful experience. Its great to see preservation of this green",
          "The day we went started out nicely, but we got caught in a huge thunderstorm when we were almost at the top. But the park itself is very impressive. We got a cab there and just walked. And walked. And walked. Amazing plants, birds and butterflies, but unfortunately we didn't see",
          "Incredible view. Amazing nature. Ideal for a walk or a biking tour. Breathtaking. Cant miss this spot when you visit Rio.",
          "This was a fantastic way to see the park with a guide. We saw major vistas and waterfalls, and walked along a hiking path. It was the right amount of time spent for a young family.",
          "This is a beautiful park not far from the beaches of Rio. It is a beautiful sanctuary in the midst of a big city.",
          "This is a must see and do while in Brasil. Definitely take a tour, I would recommend our guide Jose Neto. Chines view is amazing. Bustling attraction. People walking, jogging and biking.",
          "One of the rare 'Atlantic rain forest' is a jewel of south brazil. Distinct flora and fauna, rare parrot and parakeet species, dense vegetation and high mountains are few specialties. close proximity to city of Rio is a plus",
          "We visited parts of the national park on a guided tour and came here after having visited a more hectic farvela. The park is not extraordinary but we enjoyed the calme and tranquillity of the rain forrest and also saw a few small monkeys.",
          "Free access to this national park but we are at hiking tour to Pedra de Gavea. Lots of tropical plants, fruit trees and birds. There is a little falls in the park and see lot of persons coming for it.",
          "This rain Forrest is just beautyfull. You will see very colourfull butterflys, birds etc. You just need to take more time than the time the Jeep tours want to spent with you there. The view from the Chinese Pavillion is not to be missed.",
          "The views, the greenery, the walks and the history of the place are all remarkable. It is a contrast to and a relief from busy bustling Rio. If you are not going into a real Brasilian forest then you must do at least this",
          "I went by bus to this parque. I missed the stop outside the entrance with lack of Portuguese but it was good exercise to walk up to the entrance and then walk as far as the waterfall. I'm a kiwi and thought the waterfall was worth visiting even though many of our waterfalls are",
          "Waterfalls, chinese vista point, dense shrubbery and trees. Very green and nice. Not exceptional but beautiful.",
          "Tijuca National Park is a stunning rainforrest in the middle of Rio, popular to hikers, bicyclists and family daytrippers. With a huge variety of animal and plant species, you really get to experience some real nature - even this close to a major city. We saw birds, butterflies,",

          "Such an amazing diversion to peace and tranqility from the busy city. Much cooler temps as well. Be sure to get up to the Falls!",
          "We drove a long, winding road through the mountains going from Tijuca back to the heart of Rio. It's hard to believe you are surrounded by civilization - dense forest, wildlife - except when you come to a view point, from which there beaches are spread out below you.",
          "Enjoyed our time in Tijuca National Park. Beautiful waterfalls and vegetation and a few surprises here and there including the Chinese lookout.",
          "Absolutely beautiful and breath taking, good take on a rainforest. The animals are cute and don't seem to be completely afraid of you, as you can feed them some fruits.",
          "Quite incredible how this huge rainforest is bang slap around the city and offers a variety of roads to visit different viewpoints, picnic areas and waterfall. You see capucine monkeys, toucans, black vultures and other wildlife plus an abundance of massive trees with jungle",
          "After running around the congested tourist attractions like Sugarloaf and Corcovado, a visit to the Tijuca National Park was a pleasant change of pace. It was cool in there with all the trees and greenery. Our tour turned out to be a private and our guide, Rejane Reis, was",
          "If you are looking for wildlife, this, besides the botanical gardens is one of the best places to spot them. If you are looking for some great views of the city, make an active hike, take a shower under a waterfall(just a few are allowed), or simply want a totaly quiet place in",
          "A beautiful retreat right in the city of Rio. The Park is relaxing, the waterfall beautiful. A lovely place to relax and \"take a break\" from sightseeing.",

          "Wonderful park. we went mainly for the birds ... not quite as many as we were hoping for and didn't see a Toucan but the forest and waterfalls etc were beautiful and incredible that this park is so close to Rio. you almost need a car otherwise there is a lot of walking to",

          "What a great day we spent taking a jeep tour through Tijuca National Park! The jeeps picked us up in front of our hotel and delivered us back afterward. The forest was beautiful and cool. We stopped at various places to get out and walk around and see the view. The best view of",
          "We wanted to get away from all of carnival events and get some hiking in and this forest was beautiful and breathtaking views. I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind hiking a little. AMAZING!!!",
          "Beautiful and so close to everything in the city. There are tours you can take ... but it's not prob doing it yourself. A true treaure",
          "The first stop within the park was the pagoda at the Chinese View. The view of Rio was fantastic! You can clearly see Sugarloaf, Corcovado and Dos Hermanos mountains. The walk through the rainforest was level and the guide's explanation of the flora was interesting. This was",

          "I took a tour with a guide all over the forest, it is very big and really long hikes if you walk it all. Try to get a car or taxi to take you along the route. The Chinese view up top is really great you see everything plus christ the redeemer on the left and sugar loaf to the",
          "Nice waterfall in forestry but an anti climax if you have already seen Iguassu Falls. Full of beautiful big butterfly's and other interesting animals!",
          "A wonderful place to train , very fresh. If will run, there you can make about 14 km easy. And every sunday mornig there are people running so you can find a company too. Dont forget a repellent. When fineshed drink coconut water and go to the beach!!!",
          "A friend suggested this visit to us and it turned into the mega highlight of our stay in Rio. From Santa Theresa we took s bus to Central station then the metro to the final station at Avenida Uruguai. Take exit to Rua do Bonfim. From there you take a bus or taxi to Alto da Boa",
          "If you want to enjoy your visit to the Tijuca rain forest, don't be satisfied with a car ride through the forest. Park your car( in a designated area ) and walk on a trail( There are few trails available) in order to get the feeling of a rain forest. Please remember that in a",
          "It is quite amazing to walk in this urban forest, the largest in the world and think that it results from a human decision in the second half of the nineteenth century, where 100,000 trees have been planted by 6 people only. Remember to take a guide if you want to discover more",
          "Nice place to go on a hot afternoon and enjoy the forest and the cool air. The falls are very pretty too.",
          "Great walks through the forests with lots of trails for all levels of walkers. Car or bus up the hill and make sure you bring drinking water. Great views for camera.",
          "It's surreal and so beautiful. .. the waterfall is majestic and saw huge spiders too... so not for squeamish people. .. The forest keeps the temperatures comfortable.",
          "I did a cave tour - and it was great! Great guide, cool group and wonderful national park. I can recomend it",
          "We did a 4 hour jeep tour and the forest was a very welcome relief from Rio's heat, noise and pre-carnival nonsense. Lovely forest with waterfalls and some small wildlife. The jeep tour does offer an accessible option.",
          "Being in the rain forest was magical. The plants and trees were magnificent. There is also a water fall midway in that is lovely and great for photos!",
          "Did an afternoon trip. Was nice but nothing spectacular. Guidewas very informative although there is not a lot to tell apart from photos by the waterfall, not many more worth taking. To be done as part of Rio stay!",
          "A welcome relief to the hustle and bustle of Rio. Wonderful wildlife sounds, and exotic flora. Go early to avoid the crowds.",
          "We drove to this park wanting to climb to the top of Pico da Tijuca. What a surprising find. It was a day with light rain, but walking through the trees was very nice and not as hot as it could be on a sunny day. Definitely stop at the visitor center to see the three",
          "Like this review, it was a quick tour but well worth it. Took a driving tour with plenty of stops. Lots to see! but busy in parts.",
          "We visited the rainforest through a tour with Rio Adventures. As a preface, I think it would be challenging to navigate without a tour guide. The forest was beautiful. We went on a rainy winter day, but it was still awesome. We didn't see a lot of mammals, but the birds, plants,",
          "A fantastic park that cross several swatches of Rio. Native and planted botanical species. Lots of monkeys and birds. Take a bike ride to the Vista Chinesa (very challenging!!). Outstanding hiking trails. I've been to different spots several times, and every visit is more",
          "In the middle of the city you can find a place looking like the jungle. It's a great place where you can go by car or by feet. If you wanna go arround both sides you better take the car, but to see the nice places you sometimes need to walk a lot. There are many hiking tracks",
          "Enjoyed visiting this inner city oasis. Agree with other reviewers and suggest going there by car. Enjoyed the waterfalls and walking trails.",
          "Not something you have to do whilst in Rio but a nice to do. Best to have a guide take you through by car.",
          "Beautiful place, great views but don't go with Viator. I booked the jeep tour and they were almost an hour late picking me up and the tour was much shorter than advertised. There are busses and taxis from the city centre, go on your own.",
          "Biggest urban forest park in the world. It would be a travesty if you do not see this!! We saw this on the way to our Hang-gliding (must-do!!) and it's a lovely sight to behold!",
          "This was a beautiful day! Do not go on a day it is rainy or cloudy, you will not see a thing. Check out the sights and spend some time! It is well worth the drive and the views and paths are amazing. Bring lots of water and comfortable clothes.",
          "We took the jeep tour to Tijuca. The sights are beautiful (overlook, waterfall) but after we did that, tour guide drove us out of park to get acai to drink (not included in tour price), whereas I would have preferred to spend more time in the park. Tijuca is well worth the",
          "We drove through in an open-topped jeep from Sugarloaf to Cristo Redeemer. It's so peaceful and wonderful. The air was clean, cool and humid. We saw a few monkeys too!",
          "We took a drive through tour of this park on our way and I wouldn't recommend it, unless it's on your way. Nothing great. But if you are a hiker, it might be a different story. We didn't hike, so can't comment. Shouldn't be a priority on your trip.",
          "The park is a short ride from Christ the redeemer,Full of monkeys sloths and birds.Its hard to think you are surrounded by the city.We took a jeep tour,with a very good guide( ceasar).",
          "Was a great site if you do not have time to visit the amazon like us, we took one afternoon and visited the park, hikes were interesting, fauna and flora very abundant. We enjoyed walking around.",
          "The hike is quite easy on a dry day, it's really nice and lasts around 1.5 hours to reach the top. We had bad luck with the weather and couldn't see anything when we reached the top",
          "I had a lovely day wandering around the forest by myself. I took the 301 bus from a small terminal very near to Rodoviaria Novo Rio and got off at Alto Da Boa Vista where the entrance to the park is. The trails are pretty well signposted and I just followed the red arrows around",
          "This place is a good place for an easy hike. The path are developed and tends to be a bit slippery in wet season. Nice views from the top. A good number of flora and fauna (if you are lucky).",
          "I normally hike but not a hardcore hiker, our guide took us to Tijuca Peak during our visit in Rio and it was just awesome to be up there. The pacing was a little fast so i felt a little light headed so make sure you let your guide know if you need to stop to catch your breath.",
          "The Tijuca National Park made for a nice, half-day visit. Catch the waterfall (really beautiful) and the small chapel (both are lovely). Just walking around or driving around is beautiful. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We went as part of an organised trip to sugar loaf but I don't think we got to see the best of it by any stretch. It is a beautiful area and if I were to go back then I think I would either hire a car or go on a trip which was specifically to see the park, rather than just pass",
          "Not too bad, you get some great views of Rio, and with luick you will see some native wildlife Monkeys etc. There are some longer walks in the forest that are will laid out if you are on you own. There is an interpritation centre within the park that has a history of the area.",
          "This was our least favorite trip to be honest. Don't think your going to see like super duper rain forest wild life. Well we sure didn't see anything that amazing. I did see a monkey from a distance but it was when driving thru the mountain. The waterfall is pretty but that was",
          "My girlfriend and I (both 24) visited the park on a last minute decision and therefore didn't go on a tour. This review will say why the park was so fantastic and why not to bother paying for a tour. The park is free to enter, but is well kept and laid out. The visitor centre",
          "Its a tropical forest in the city,nice views small cascades,places for picknick and playground,you have the \"smell\" of the tropics, so full of different trees,we also saw birds,and flowers and tropical fruits",
          "Such a pretty drive in Tijuca. We were in an open Jeep so we really got to look around and see all the beautiful scenery. There are some very nice lookout points. It does get a little chilly when you are up higher so bring a light sweater or jacket even if it's warm down by the",
          "We were fortunate enough to check this place out on a bike tour with Bike in Rio tours and saw some amazing parts of this forest. This is the best way to explore this forest!",
          "A must see. There is a very calm and \"developed\" path in the park park if you don't want to go off road. If you want to go off road, there are monkey and snake filled routes for you thrill seeking iron men and women, in fact, all Iron People. But go prepared with proper hiking",
          "Visited the park with the jeeptourwith guide Ian and trainee Sacha. Both were kind and knowledgible. But during our morningtour the mountains, and so the park, were surrounded with clouds and therefor there was \u00e0 constant light drizzle. Because of the clouds we missed the",
          "Do t!he open air Jeep Tour, excellent guide from a bit of history of the forest to the 30 minute hike.",
          "Very nice park! It's soo big! A lot of monkeys and intersting animals, you feel like in real jungles there. It's really cool to spend day there and walk around",
          "Arrived here on a jeep tour, our guide was very knowledgeable, saw some monkeys , so made my day, the waterfalls were truly special.",
          "We visited Tijuca and it was fantastic. All the beautiful forest and the air...oh you just have to go there. It is so relaxing and beautiful.",
          "The perfect hangout in Rio Spend an afternoon traveling there (car required), quite and natural environment, and great views form Rio from the woods",
          "We took a jeep tour to the top where we did a mini hike through the rainforest! If you go in the summer, you'll see a lot more animals but it's still beautiful! Pack warm clothes! It gets chilly up there!",
          "Suggestion - take your car and drive around, promise it is worth the drive! Beautiful landscapes, far from the craziness of the city",
          "My husband and I had hired Rafael Torres Lopes (Tour Guide) brazilrafario@gmail.com for a one-day private tour. As part of the tour we visited Tijuca National Park. What a beautiful park to have right next to the city of Rio. Take a camera and enjoy. Might not be the top sight",
          "We hired a driver to explore Tijuca, but I don't think we had any idea how long a drive it would be! Not recommended to those with car sickness. The forest and views are beautiful though, and worth a visit if you have the time. Only saw two monkeys. :(",
          "The national tijuca park is a must see in Rio, but due to it's distance from the city center it's not a tourist place. This is the perfect place to hick and you will find one of the most amasing views.",
          "It was one of our visits during our stay in Rio. We booked an excursion and the tour guide was superb. It was a small group of people (8) so it was almost personalized. The views from there are also wonderful. You can see, if lucky, some fauna and very exotic plants, trees, and",
          "A very nice park to visit and not too far away. Nice waterfalls. We managed to take very nice photos and went all over the places there.",
          "We took a jeep tour into the park, and it was a great way to see it. The roads are the same ones that will be used for the cycling in the olympics. Also some amazing views of the city from the Chinese Pavilion. A great waterfall as well.",
          "Amid this chaotic cosmopolitan metropolis the ride through the forest is a surprising highlight with an abundance of wildlife.",
          "Picturesque waterfall, beautiful views, luscious vegetation with easy access by car and on foot. Take the camera.",
          "Went with kids (11 & 6). It's not essential to go right to the top. There are hiking trials closer to the entrance. The kids were great as they managed to walk the entire way down. Lots of water required.",
          "Now I understand why Brazilians are so proud of their country. They tend to exaggerate or magnify their assets but now I have to admit they are absolutely right. This forest and national park is located 30 minutes away from Rio's heart. Wherever you look at you see the power of",
          "Do not take a car and zip past this national park. I suggest you hike it up to really absorb the details of the flora and fauna. There is a lot of history in here too.",
          "Being a professional guide/photographer at Rio Photo Guide, I highly recommend a visit to the Tijuca National Park. Located in the hart of Rio, a few minutes from the main districts of the city, Tijuca Forest preserves hundreds of species of flora and fauna found only in the",
          "We took a jeep tour and stopped at the Chinese View and Emporer's Table. Meh. It was late in the day. Didn't see any wildlife. Met some great people, though. Based on other reviews, I think our guides short-changed us. It was a drive up, two stops, and a drive down. I was",
          "We stopped here on our way to Christ the Redeemer. I got to see monkeys in the wild and just take in the jungle. A nice little added piece to our trip.",
          "The rainforest is only 10 minutes from the centre of Rio and couldn't be more different. We were driven in a jeep through the forest stopping to see a Chinese pagoda and The Cascatinha Falls. Part of this route is being used for the 2016 Olympic Cycling road race.",
          "Oh my God, a rainforest in a city?! Why can't every place be this beautiful. We saw a monkey on our drive through. I can cross that off my bucket list now. We took a jeep tour which I highly recommend.",
          "This is like visiting three different places in one, in one hand you can enjoy the nature and forest and in the other hand you get to see a little it of Metropolis.",
          "Great tropical rainforest so close to Rio. Worthwhile to get out of Rio for a day. We did a tour which probably didn't do it justice but a great place to visit",
          "A place to get lost in a pair of comfy sneakers, takes a whole day and offers you a dozen of perfect nature and you even can hug a monkey=)",
          "Catch a minibus from Tijuca 40 minutes up the mountain, still in the heart of the city. Hang on for the ride of your life!! Head by bus up to the Floresta da Tijuca, a dense mountain rainforest located in the heart of Rio. Our son has a gleam in his eye and suggests that instead",
          "Rain forest in the city . Interesting break away from crowded RIO The best view of Rio is from The Chinese Kiosque",
          "I'm not sure why they call it \"urban\" forest. It's VERY real forest in the middle of Rio... WEAR BATHING SUIT UNDERNEATH YOUR CLOTHES - you will come across some some GORGEOUS waterfalls you can bathe in as you trek. BRING A SANDWICH! DO NOT GO TO THE RESTAURANT ON THE TOP.",
          "Christ the Redeemer. You just drive through but I can only image what it can be to wander around for a day. When cycling up to the half way point I saw monkeys and beautiful butterflies",
          "This is a lovely park that you get to see on the trip to Corcovado, it's great to see to see a huge swathe of greenery so close to this huge city.",
          "Fun way to spend a few hours. the Scenery is great and the waterfall is the best part. Amazing what the city planners started so long ago.",
          "We really enjoyed this jeep tour. There is quite a lot of beautiful vantage points of the city of Rio. There are some lovely waterfalls and it was interesting to see the tropical rain forest. We had good weather, but it still was good to bring a jacket because it can get chilly",
          "We went to Tijuca Park buy a tour company that picked us up at 0900.The trip took 4 hours and were shown some nice sights in the National Park. To me it was a bit disappointing as I thought we would see more than just a forest. We stopped a few times to take photos . The views",
          "If you choose to take a tour of Tijuca National Park and the rainforest and opt to do it in an open air 8 passenger jeep...don't do it on a day it is pouring cats and dogs! The park is probably really lovely...and we did see some pretty waterfalls but mostly we some some",
          "Tijuca forest and National park it's in the centre of Rio! Amazing! How many cities in the world can say they have a 40sqkm of tropical forest downtown. There are many tours to the forest, and it includes the Corcovado Mountain.",
          "Great place to visit and it comes for free. We drove up the road by car. On the way there is a beautiful waterfall. Once you get on top you can park the car, and from there it took us 1h15mins to hike to the top - Pico da Tijuca. It all comes for free and was definitely worth",
          "Drove through the Tijuca National Park with a private guide, Marcos (from Rio on the Map. I highly recommend Marcos who's friendly, easygoing and a great guide!) We went on a 30minute nature walk through the park which might be the best part of my tour. It was a wonderful",
          "We did the jeep tour through the park. Our favorite place was the Chinese Overlook and the jeep ride through town was the best part. I would choose the Botanical Garden (go on the Atlantic Forest trail) over the full park visit.",
          "this is the largest urban forest on earth , lots to see but you need a car to get there lots of places to stop and rest beautiful waterfall and a lovely old chapel to visit",
          "As part of our Jeep Tour, after visiting the Botanical Gardens we visited Tijuca National Park. I was so impressed that this huge area with beautiful trees, plants, and animals was protected. The view from Chinese Viewpoint was a \"wow\" moment for sure. The jeep ride was fun too.",
          "so, there were ten of us on this little journey into the local paradise jungle of tijuca national park. the ride there was not a long distance but lots of city traffic to get out of, so , the short ride was a little longer than we expected. not that this was a bad think, just",
          "We only saw a small part of this vast and amazing jungle restoration project that is part of Rio. Its worth spending a day or two here while visiting Rio. You can get jeep day tours from central Rio but we enjoyed a full midday hike of about 4 miles into the park and to the",
          "You better hike this forest if you don't wanna miss a part of Rio. It's absolutely magical, beautiful, right in the center of Rio and in the nature at the same time. Wear pants and insect products to protect yourself from mosquito & co. Few agencies offer you tour in the forest",
          "Within the confines of the park much flora and fauna is to be found. However, the Vista Chinesa is the show stopper! Facing northeast it provides the perfect counterpoint to Sugarloaf Mountain. Please don't feed the friendly monkeys!",
          "This is a great park right near Rio that has breathtaking views of the city and beach. It is hilly and has lots of great hiking trails. There is a fun hike to the waterfalls that is so refreshing once you arrive and swim in the pool. It is a good place for walkers, runners,",
          "A wonderful find in the middle of the City. The vegetation was so rich and varied and as we climbed to the top were able to see the Sky Divers at play. A fantastic view of the City below.",
          "If you have a day extra go for a hike ......i used rio extreme excellent experience. You will need around half a day for the trip but worth every minute",
          "It's a good park with a great waterfall but it is only one. You spend most of your time driving to the waterfall area. There isn't a lot to offer, except for the possible animal here or there. Maybe there's more during the summer months. A definite go-see but definitely add it",
          "This is largest urban forest in world. It is a haven in the middle of the city offering hiking, waterfalls and incredible vistas. Saw monkeys and Toucans. Most incredible view from Chinese vista..not to be missed.",
          "I was looking forward to visiting Tijuca National Park to learn about the fauna and flora in the rain forest. So I joined a Jeep Tour on a cloudy morning. Unfortunately it began to rain, soon after we entered the park. So we saw no animals, while our jeep climbed the winding",
          "Very large forest where you can enjoy the nature and not far away from centre of Rio.

          "This place was special...we visited it on a rainy day, which made the water falls looks so unreal...I loved breathing in the fresh air all while being in the middle of RIO. this is a must stop while in rio...rent a cab, drive through and just make few stops, the cabby's will",
          "We took this tour with Julio Batista Private Tours, tourguidejulio@gmail.com. He was wonderful! He took us to a vista that will give you a view like no other found in Rio! In addition to the lovely rain forest, we also saw a HUGE snake! There are many walkable trails that one",
          "Tijuca Park was my first attraction visit in Rio. An amazing place to see and experience. For those who are visiting Rio is a must go place.",
          "Beautiful forest, most part was re-introduced by humans after it was nearly cleared out by humans. Worthy of seeing. We were lucky to see an anaconda-like python in a tree next to a road. Huge and a little scary!",
          "Went on a jeep tour through this forest. Great views and things to take pictures of. Potential to see some interesting wildlife (snakes, toucans) Would recommend going with some kind of tour guide because the history is very interesting.",
          "Very good place to practice hiking. A plant of treks, like Pico da Tijuca and Pico do Papagaio, both you can go by car until the beginnig of the trek.",
          "Tijuca National Park has a very special atmosphere, it's not only the lush green trees and plants and wild life but for me it has the smell of the jungle. A place I like to go back to every time I visit Rio de Janeiro, whether it's on a hot day or in the pouring tropical rain,",
          "Parque Nacional da Tijuca is a great surprise! There is a place called Cascatinha Taunay that is a hidden jewel. Keep your eye and ears open as there is wild life around and you will be able to see monkeys, parots, and colorful birds. There is restroom available at the parking",
          "If you want to have a wonderful view over Ipenama, Leblon, the Lagoa de Freitas and also the favelas, go up to the Vista Chinesa. This alone deserves the detour.",
          "Came through the Park on our scooter tour! A have of tranquillity just a stones throw from the hustle and bustle of Rio city!!!",
          "I enjoyed my time here at the Tijuca National park. The park it self was very clean and quiet with lots of waterfalls and other sightseeing stuff.",
          "If you are a nature lover and like walks in the wild, this is the place for you. Full of small animals, birds, water falls and great trails , the Park is a good place to spend a day exploring. But again, do not go alone. There are guides to lead you or you can go in a group from",
          "Took an open top jeep tour through the National Park. Very cool. The Chinese lookout is a must stop for pictures - once of the best views of Rio because you get both Christ the Redeemer and the Sugarloaf in the same picture. Taunay waterfall is lovely - though in Winter I bet",
          "We did a medium-tough hike up to the peak of Tijuca - which was a fantastic experience for kids. You do not need a guide if you can get to the entrance - the trail is well marked, but a guide would not hurt. You can see the whole Rio from the top - 360\u02da but cannot see Christ o",
          "I took a tour with about 5 other people and a very sweet guide. It was so great to get into the jungle and breath fresh air. I would love to come back and just walk up there some time. We didn't see any animals but learned about some of the different trees and the history of",
          "We drove through the forest. It is very hilly and I was glad our guide was driving. Do stop at the Chinese view for pics. So green and beautiful!",
          "Great local rainforest. Take a taxi or jeep tour through...latter is open air for views but no offloading. Vista, waterfall, short hike on Jeep tour.",
          "Nature at its basic state - lush green trees, beautiful waterfalls and amazing wildlife Don't forget to put your insect repellant on - I did and got bitten by something that made me itch for days",
          "its basically a forest on the edge of the city. its worth seeing if you have time to kill or like to cycle/walk, but would not go out of your way to fit this into your schedule. other than the decent views from the top, there is not much to it.",
          "Not a priority, but if you have the time, spending a few hours to visit the park is worth it. But it is difficult to get there.",
          "This is one of our favorite places when we visit Rio. The park provides a nice break from the city. On our last visit we encountered a monitor lizard which caused great excitement with the kids.",
          "I thought I would have to go to the top of Pedra da Gavea to get to the top of Rio. Not so! Hike to the top of this park and you'll be just slightly higher without the frightening climb that I've been reading about. You may drive partially up the mountain, stopping along the",
          "I could easily spend 2 or 3 days in this park. Me and my husband took our 7 year-old son and my 13 year-old stepson there and it was amazing. The Floresta da Tijuca (the forest) has great hiking ways which vary from easy, medium and hard. Go there early to enjoy one of the",
          "one of the most beautiful vegetation in Rio,check out with family,friends or just your date,calm and nice and easy place to checkout",
          "I am glad we done this prior to visiting the Amazon and Pantanal. However for a city break it is ideal and gives you a taste for what is coming in the rest of Brazil. Not much in terms of facilities but a pleasant stroll and interesting scenery.",
          "This review is for a short tour made by car: We went in October, and we had a lovely time in a private tour that started in Parque Nacional da Tijuca. It wasn't the highlight of our tour, since we were actually going Tree Trekking, but it was relaxing to start the day this way.",
          "just fantastic way to spend any day ! you feel engulfed by the beauty and grandness of the forest. Sunny days feel cool in there, cool days feel more warm. Just heaven. Go to the park then go to the beach!",
          "I spent a week at Carnival and was a little frustrated I am so close to the Amazon rainforest without the ability to explore it. This is no Amazon rainforest but it is beautiful. It was nice breathing fresh air, feeling the coolness of the forest, seeing some small waterfalls",
          "We were able to see some of the park on our way to the Christ the Redeemer statue. Very green and pretty.",
          "Beautiful trails, waterfalls, birds, views, all under a canopy of rain forest that makes you feel like you're a hundred miles from the busy-ness of Rio. A great half day of exploring.",
          "We're from Europe, so for us this was a real treat, as we don't have this type of tropical nature back home. We went with a guide, started early morning and spent 3-4 hours there, but you can make it a whole day. We went hiking, saw some caves, waterfalls and great nature.highly",
          "WE went with a guide on this trip along with the garden. The park is impressive is size and it was a nice change from the beach. Really just rode through and stopped at some key spots. Worth it but not in place of some other more interesting sites in Rio",
          "I came to the park with a friend & her family, so they drove & showed me the sights, which isn't much help to the majority of Tripadvisor. You can easily spend a day here wandering up into the park along the tracks & the waterfalls are pretty amazing, especially in the heat. I",
          "This park reminds me of the jungles in Africa but in the city in this instance. it was an awesome experience driving through the park and eventually taking the trail. The hiking is challenging enough and the climbing getting to the Pico de Tijuca is even more difficult but it\u00b4s",
          "Awesome hike- challenging and steep- get ready to get your hands dirty if you hike Corcovado, and brin plenty of mosquito repellent. Beautiful park. The monkeys are friendly and love bananas ;)",
          "Finding information on getting to the National Park without getting on a jeep tour is difficult so I hope this helps. We took a taxi to the park as we are short on time but it is possible to get a bus there if you research lines and stops before. We asked the taxi driver to",
          "you need to go with special people because this is very bis ! you will find restaurants and this is a litle GREEN inside the city !",
          "Its a big park, and plenty of hiking to do if you wish. The views are spectacular in some places. If you want to see it by car, I recommend hiring a cab for a couple of hours. The costs are fairly reasonable (keep the meter running).",
          "I was lucky enough to be driven around many times through Tijuca Park. It's lushness provides Rio with it climate and also incredible vistas to Rio. Minkies roam freely. Waterfalls and short hikes are throughout the park. It's the backbone of Rio itself.",
          "We took a 3 hour tour with Evandro Silva from Bambui Tours - a really friendly and knowledgeable guide. It was just the two of us in his car and making an early start meant that after a short drive 20 minute hike we reached the picturesque waterfall ahead of anyone else and went",
          "The park is Gorgeous and definitively worth visiting! When you go to the Christ you get to see a lot of it! It is wonderful to see such great piece of nature in the middle of a big city like Rio De Janeiro",
          "Tijuca park is large. Best to visit by car. You can make wonderful strolls to waterfalls and think you are in a jungle. There are places for barbecueing. It has restaurants. Also nice for kids.",

          "We went on a tour of the Tijuca and I was very impressed, included a beautiful lookout, where we could see most of Rio, Copa Cabana, Sugarloaf, etc. Then there was a massive waterfall! Then we went on an easy trek on a trail through the forest, and though i was a bit",
          "We took a private car tour of Tijuca National Park and thought it was money well spent. If you're the outdoorsy type, you can hike or bike the different trails but make sure to time it properly as people have gotten lost in the park in the dark and Tijuca is the largest",
          "Sugar loaf during the World Cup had a four wait to get to the top. While Chinese lookout had 10 people for probably the best view in the city. This is by far the best kept secret in Rio. Its about a 20 minute drive to the top. I had the cab driver wait for us which cost us",

        "wiki": "Escadaria Selar\u00f3n, also known as the 'Selaron Steps',  is a set of world-famous steps in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They are the work of Chilean-born artist Jorge Selar\u00f3n who claimed it as \"my tribute to the Brazilian people\".\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1990, Selar\u00f3n began renovating dilapidated steps that ran along the front of his house. At first, neighbours mocked him for his choice of colours as he covered the steps in fragments of blue, green and yellow tiles \u2013 the colours of the Brazilian flag. It started out as a side-project to his main passion, painting, but soon became an obsession. He found he was constantly out of money, so Selar\u00f3n sold paintings to fund his work. It was long and exhausting work but he continued on and eventually covered the entire set of steps in tiles, ceramics and mirrors.\n\n\n== The steps ==\nRunning from Joaquim Silva street and Pinto Martins street, officially known as Manuel Carneiro street, the steps straddle the Lapa and Santa Teresa neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro. There are 215 steps measuring 125 metres long which are covered in over 2000 tiles collected from over 60 countries around the world. No sooner than one section of the steps were 'finished', Selar\u00f3n started work on another section, constantly changing it so that it was an ever evolving piece of art. Selar\u00f3n considered the work as \"never complete\" and claimed that \"This crazy and unique dream will only end on the day of my death\".Originally, tiles for the work were scavenged from various construction sites and piles of urban waste found on the Rio streets. But in later years most of the tiles were donated by visitors from all around the world. Of the 2000+ tiles, 300-odd are hand painted by Selar\u00f3n depicting a pregnant African woman. Selar\u00f3n didn't comment on this except to say that it was a \"Personal problem from my past\".Later the work spilled over to steps at the foot of the Arcos da Lapa.\n\n\n== Jorge Selar\u00f3n ==\n\nJorge Selar\u00f3n was born in Chile in 1947. He traveled, lived and worked as a painter and sculptor in over 50 countries around the world before arriving and deciding to settle in Rio de Janeiro in 1983. He began renovating the steps on a whim in 1990. Many times, his phone was cut off and he was threatened to be evicted from his house due to being unable to afford the living costs. He sold many paintings and accepted donations from locals and travelers to continue his work. Since 1977, Selar\u00f3n claimed to have sold over 25,000 portraits, all featuring the same pregnant woman which mostly funded his work. It was a labor of love for the artist who resided in the same house by the steps he lived in when he started the work. He was mostly unfazed by the attention given to him by curious onlookers and tourists alike. He was constantly spotted at the steps working by day and treating drunken revelers to fascinating anecdotes by night.\nSelar\u00f3n was found dead January 10, 2013, on the famous Lapa steps. His body was found with burn marks.\n\n\n== International recognition ==\nThe work has featured in many famous magazines, newspapers, travel shows, documentaries and commercials. National Geographic Channel, American Express, Coca-Cola, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Time and Playboy are just some of the media that the steps have appeared in/on. It has also featured in numerous music videos such as Snoop Dogg's Beautiful, as well as U2 also filming there. It is considered an iconic tourist attraction of Rio de Janeiro with travellers from across the globe visiting it every day. In 2009 the steps were featured in Rio's 2016 Olympic bid video \"The Passion Unites Us\". The steps were also featured in the show The Amazing Race 18 where teams were tasked to find a tile resembling a route info sign.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "While this location is extremely busy and hard to really appreciate due to the crowds of people trying to get the perfect Instagram picture, it is still worth going to see. The artist decided to tile the steps out of his own pocket and as people visited they started to send",
          "Very cool place to visit lovey story behind it looking for all the personal tiles was fun but yes it was crowded very friendly atmosphere there though more so than Times Square or maybe Rome I liked it there",
          "Really cool area and was great to get pictures taken on the famous steps. Lots of places around for drink or food and place had a great vibe",

          "I was not aware of these steps until we were dropped here briefly on a guided tour, but I'm glad we came. They're crowded, Instagram princesses and their harried boyfriends spend their entire time searching for the perfect spot and the crowds never stop. My advice? Just chill,",

          "Second time in Rio, we decided to visit the steps again. As you are aware to be safe in Rio. Walking back down the steps around 18.00. We heard screams and shouting, to see two men run past and jump on a motorbike with one holding a gun!! . Further down we encountered two women",
          "Selaron is the artist responsible for tiling these steps with his own money. When he ran out of money, he would sell his artwork. People started hearing about his efforts and sent him tiles from all over the world. It is quite the work of art not to be missed. Selaron was",
          "Glad I have seen the steps and appreciate they are architecturally impressive. However, the surrounding area is not great with no appealing opportunities to have a nice drink or snack and appreciate the steps. In fact it's the most unsafe I have felt in my trip to Rio.",
          "My wife and I did the free walking tour in downtown Rio and this was our last stop on the tour. We walked up this very narrow and crowded street to get to the steps. They were extremely crowded with lots of tourists and street vendors. We were told this is the third most visited",
          "The stairs of Selaron is not the most beautiful stair in the world, but you have to appreciate it because it was done by one man who dedicated himself to beautifying the surroundings with all his efforts. It is colorful and full with youngs and not so youngs taking pictures",
          "Would desperately be looking 4 when this place wasn't PACKED!!! Rainy day and it looked like a cruise ship had dumped all its passengers here! Pretty? Who couldsee to say?",

          "Very busy when we came with tour group, especially during Carnival season. Make sure that you dont get ripped off with alcoholic drinks. Was a blessing to see the steps and walk to the top.",
          "We took our time and climbed to the top. The tiles in the bottom half are more elaborate, but the stairs keep going past the initial view, with beautiful pieces of art all the way.",
          "Yes there are 200 steps. But take your time to climb. You only climb a few, rest by having a close look at the tiles from all over the world. We went after sunset and it was dark. There is good lighting. To think it was one man's passion to start this and the time he took to",
          "It's a must to see for the coloured stairs but a part of that nothing more. If you have time visit it but to take a photo alone better to go early in the morning when there are few people.",
          "Yes, it can be overcrowded but take the time to learn the life story of the artist, Chilean Jorge Selaron, before visiting to truly appreciate this colorful place. Our private guide (Rafael Torres Lopes, the best) was a friend of Se\u00f1or Selaron and had wonderful personal stories",
          "Lovely, singular place full of colour and magic. It's a must to take a picture of yourself at this incredible place in Lapa!",

          "What a marvel this is, we were taken her by our tour guide as a scheduled stop but I'd have to say that you need probably an hour or so here to really appreciate what it is, as we had limited time heading to sugarloaf afterwards. The steps are colourful and show a real passion",
          "If you start from top there are less people. Easier for pictures. Not everybody climb to the top. The bottom part is very crowded",
          "piece of colorful art In the downtown of Rio De Janeiro, Work of Chilean artist, Jorge Selaron, there are more than 200 steps covered by tiles from different countries \u201d over the world\u201d each may till story.",
          "I think everyone stops here for a visit. The artist who loves red if you didn\u2019t notice, worked on this for 23 years. There\u2019s so much to see. They are tiles from all over the world. Check them out.",
          "We visited on a very hot day and had the taxi driver drop us at the top of the stairs (possible with a small car, streets are very narrow) so we could walk down them. Beautiful tile work and just lovely to see how it brightens up the neighborhood!",
          "Colorful stairs, mix of cultures. The area didn't seem the best but the stairs is a must visit. We visited it during the afternoon it was many people around, not sure about the evening hours safety.",
          "The place is undoubtedly fascinating and cool however it is teaming with tourists and it is impossible to get an uninterrupted photo. Despite this, the place is so unique and is an iconic attraction in Rio.",
          "Iconic part of the old town. Lots of colorful tiles referring to different countries, cities , football clubs, religions etc.. Also you're standard Rio Instagram photo and a nice walk all up the hill to Santa Teresa where you could have a nice high up view of Rio from top",
          "Designed in the Brazilian flag colours, green, yellow & blue by Chillian designer Selaron who mysteriously also was killed on the same steps finally. He also placed tiles from different countries across the world around the steps. Stunning and worth a visit!!!",
          "Loved going to see all the tiles on the stairs. I even walked all the way to the top. It\u2019s very crowded but everyone is polite when trying to take photos. Definitely a must see in Rio.",
          "We visit it at the 26.12.2019. It was so crowded, nice place... Every few steps have a different colour. You will be amazed to see how they done it.. So beautiful place",

          "What a great way to spend part of your day in Rio de Janeiro. These stairs have a history to tell. From the story of Selar\u00f3n to the individuals inspired by his work and donated unique tiles. There are many vendors here where you can get the cheapest and strongest caipirinhas in",
          "The steps in themselves aren\u2019t much to look at and were very busy. Once at the top turn left and walk up a steep road, there is a shop on right so turn right here and right again and there are the remains of a church which are free to visit. Back down the steps nearer to arcos",
          "Nice place to visit. Very busy but I suppose that\u2019s what you expect at a tourist destination. The place has a cool feel and vibe due to the colours and mixture of tiles used on the steps. Can get some great photos even if most will have other people in the background. Definitely",
          "This is a highly personal yet inclusive functional art. We were moved by the artist\u2019s intentions and the visitors who contributed the tiles to make this work alive. Wonderful hopeful place!",
          "The steps are impressive, but it is so hard to really see them due to all the other people. I went as part of a trip (probably part of the issue !), but I had inadvertently already been there a couple of days earlier, in the pouring rain and with no one around, and I am really",
          "The steps are beautiful, free and a must see in Rio. The higher you go on the steps the less crowded they are. There is also a Brazilian flag mural at the stop of the steps. Great stop.",
          "Nice, colorful, magnificent work. Another nice place to visit in Rio, but everyone should remember that it's in a dangerous neighborhood, so avoid being there close to sunset. During a normal day, it's completely safe. Maybe just some pickpockets as elsewhere in the world.",
          "Multi year project completed by one individual, to completely tile a staircase. Many tiles came from various areas of the world, all authentic. Quite a sight to see.",
          "Creativity makes the place attractive as local artist glued risers of climbing stairs with thousands of different tiles...",

He created the staircase with glazed tiles that he created and was willing to change his own tiles with the ones, other people from all over the world",
          "It\u2019s not all that it used to be. Thieves are there, if you have valuable stuff don\u2019t bring them out. The place is smelly and over crowded. If you\u2019re going to visit make sure it\u2019s part of a bundle deal where they take u to several places within the same deal. But the story behind",
          "These stairs done by artist Selaron have to be seen to be appreciated ! They are made from tiles from all over the world. Amazing & great fun to look at. We loved, despite pouring.rain. Near lots of other Centro Rio attravtions. Don't miss it!",
          "This open air art of tiles is one of the symbols of lapa. On the street going to it you will also cross by grafitti of love. Tiles from all over the world, you can find one from your country or city there. Worth to see. Upstairs goes to santa teresa but recommend to use another",
          "This is a must see in Rio. Colorful tiles along with a colorful, yet sad, story of the artist Selaron.",
          "Exactly what I expected! Colour, crowds, touristy with a capital T. Display of Brazilian Martial Arts drew a big crowd - some were there to harvest the onlookers but you very quickly get to know when you're being watched. Wide awake and wits about you and you won't become a",
          "When we visited the steps they were busy with so many happy people. There was music playing and some people were dancing. Street vendors were selling drinking and trinkets. The steps themselves are stunning and vibrant. Worth a wander!!",
          "An impressive feature to the city but be sure to get there early because the insta-crowds love it... Also be sure to read up on the history behind the steps and the reason why they are cherished by many... RIP Selaron",
          "Overall, the Escadaria Selaron is located in an artsy neighborhood (Lapa) with an edgy vibe.It's an excellent place to get cool photos to flex for your friends on IG, Facebook etc.... Surrounding neighborhoods isn't the safest so be extra careful and aware of your",
          "The amount of work and time it must have taken to finish this is simply amazing. This is a great attraction to see, the only down side the number of people that are at be foot of the steps taking photos and not necessarily appreciating the art of the whole thing. A little",
          "The steps are the wotk of Jorge Selaron, a Chilean born artist who started out to tile his own steps and it became an obsession.There are 215 steps and over 2,000 tiles in bright reds, blues and yellow.The area is colorful but edgy and not a place to wander alone at night.but OK",
          "These steps are more than a beautifully decorated public space. Persons have put themselves and their own ideas into the many tiles that fill the \u201cwalls\u201d and steps up the hill and this part of the city named after the person who started this. It is as if these steps have become",
          "Going up a stairway like \"no other stairway\" was going up this stairway with not just colorful tiles but among them those with art scenes & those with mentions or scenes of \"specific places\" on them (such as a number of tiles in a row for 'Kazahstan', one with Dutch windmills,",
          "That is what you can do here, nice bu a bit too crowded with tourists who want to take pictures all the time",
          "He meticulously maintained these beautiful steps out of love for his neighborhood. While the \u201ccommercialization\u201d of the steps probably would\u2019ve upset him, pay tribute to his passion by visiting this amazing artwork. Early, it was just colorful tiles representing the Brazilian",
          "Nice setting with plenty of photo opportunities! Quite busy (but it was a weekend). Really cool grafitti in the surrounding area too",
          "Just be careful if you go alone there. Stairs are OK but nothing else. Good street art and a lot of people to party with.",
          "Tiles with pictures and words from almost every county can be located on the steps and walls. Beware of pickpockets in this area as a lot of people are distracted taking photos. A good insight to the culture of the area, good vibes and a number of fresh fruit juice vendors as",
          "This is a nice place to take pictures!! But to be more than that it is interesting to know the history of this place. Why the tiles are there, who put them... Knowing this kind of things will enhance your experience. At least it made the staircase more magical to me.",
          "I don't think that the steps are ever as empty as shown in this photo especially on a weekend but it is still worth the visit to see this cool piece of folk art that was 10 years in the making. If you are already wandering around Santa Theresa or Centro it's worth the stop.",
          "The street art on the street below is also worth seeing. On the steps we had our own photo tile made - \u00a35 and we had a photo taken of just us on the steps. A fun momento At the top of the steps there were a few buskers which was fun.",
          "I loved it. It's really beautiful, with tiles in many languages, old and you, \"serious\" and funny. Great photo-opps ;-) Highly recommended",
          "This staircase is truly beautiful . So creative and lovely to walk up however walking down is less appealing as you can\u2019t see the tiles walking down. Very busy and touristy and mega hot in the heat of Rio so be prepared for this. The legend about the artist having a fascination",
          "Very colorful and attractive touristic spot. On sunny day photos that you would make here would be amazing due to the colors and contrast. It is always nice to be there earlier in the morning before the crowd or in the afternoon when most of the day tours are gone from the spot.",
          "The district the steps are in is very interesting. So much history. I advise to be cautious as it is a hectic area. But a must see.",
          "We visited midday and luckily for us it wasn\u2019t overly busy. Street leading up to the base of the steps was full of homeless types which could feel intimidating for some but they never bothered us. Definitely worth a visit, take time to really look at the individual tiles as",
          "this is part of the One day Rio tour guide was very informative (Alsima R Costa) speaks English very well also Spanish and Portuguese beautiful works of art",
          "So glad we visited tis place. Such fun looking for the tiles of cities around the world. So color. So creative. The \"Gaulti\" eccentric artist of tiles. Shame he died - could hv done more",
          "This is a must see whilst in Rio. Great photo moments. I kept on thinking about Pharrell and snoop Dogg\u2019s video- Beautiful that was shot here. Lol. Escadaria Selaron is Right by Lapa\u2019s night life",
          "A free and fun trip - selfie heaven so adults and teenagers all happy! Go early so its not too busy. Enjoy the musicians playing at the top. Lots of opportunity for fun pics whilst enjoying breathtaking art! And did I mention its FOR FREE!",
          "This place is very nice for a photo stop. A lot of tourists come here and so most of the time the places is crowded. Worth a visit and this place is not far from the city center.",
          "The steps are a great place to visit but it does get very crowded. We managed to take lots of pictures despite the crowds. It's such a fun and quirky place and the stalls that sell cheap Caipirinha were definitely the highlight!",
          "Most famous steps in Brazil and the world. Must visit. We got to the steps at 8am. Ghost town. I was a able to take a picture with no one on the steps",
          "The steps are a neat place to visit but go early to try and avoid the crowds. I enjoyed finding tiles from all the countries I've visited.",
          "Here again one of the best attractions of Rio. Those steps covered with colorful tiles made by a Chilian artist are marvelous. Pay attention that the tiles of the steps are green, yellow, blue (as the colors of the Brazilian flag) whereas on the walls the dominant color is red.",
          "The very famous steps are a must see whilst in Rio, however be prepared for huge numbers of tourists and everyone waiting to get that insta photo without people in the background. The area itself is abit dodgy so again be aware of pick pockets. Despite this it is a very",
          "We went on a weekday afternoon, and it was still somewhat crowded. There was a line of people waiting at the entrance to take their picture with the tiles that spell out \u201cselaron.\u201d We just walked up the side and took a pic without waiting or cutting in front, and continued up",
          "I wanted to avoid crowds, therefore, I decided to get here at 7am. Best decision! It gave us enough time for our group to take pictures (6 of us) and explore before it began to get crowded. This isn\u2019t too far away from the cable cars and the Christ redeemer, so you can explore",
          "Super crowded. Artistic. Great photo opportunity. Great graffitti around if you like to take those pictures. Handmadre items available around too. Constant hustle and bustle, so getting uncrowded photos proves to be a challenge!",
          "We got there early so it wasn't over crowded but it was busy. We found it interesting and photogenic. Finding a taxi to get there and to leave was no problem.",
          "This is a must-see part of any visit to Rio but do take care. Watch you possessions and be aware of your surroundings. You can buy a tile with your picture on it for 35 reals (approx \u00a37) which is great value. Rio people are nice and helpful. The walk up the stairs is long but",
          "Went here on a walking tour and arrived at around 1:30pm and it was rammed. Tourists everywhere! Haha. So if you want to go and get some beautiful pics with maybe only 6 other people around. We decided to go back the next morning, getting up early and back to hotel for",
          "It was nice to be in the marketplace watching people hustle and bustle about, taking pictures, smiling and shopping. Don\u2019t pay anyone to take your picture or make you think you have to stand in line to take the picture, all you have to do is walk up a little higher and take",
          "I had to take a screen shot of this place through the internet and showed it taxi driver to get me to this place which is quite far from copacabana,I would be appreciate the taxi drivers of rio de janeirio for their honesty,they charged me according to the meter and did not",
          "Well I have seen many pictures and videos plus being in movies so I decided to see this for myself. It is just as you see it in photographs and videos. Very colorful steps remarkable colors big long steps to reach the top. So unless you really need to see it in person and take",
          "It\u2019s like murals on steps and a bit on the walls. It\u2019s also colourful and represents a part of Brazilian culture. A bit too crowded and people are lining up to take photos of the steps. Better to walk up the steps and look at the description the tiles.",
          "Loved the art of the tiles. Can certainly recommend to take the time and walk up the stairs and to maybe look for your home town/country",
          "Very nice touristic spot Not so crowed Dodgy neighborhood it no need for guide in my advice Definitely worth a visit",
          "It was a cool story behind how this was established. Apparently it's a big attraction with famous people going there. It's off the beaten path but worth taking 30 minutes to go see it.",
          "The colored tiles steps is a pleasant surprise in the city streets. If you walk up and down the steps (more up) you are bound to find some moments without people around for a good shot. 30min there are recommended.",
          "Very popular touristy place in the heart of Lapa, worth checking out if you are in the area, can whizz through it very quick",
          "Yes, the tiles are a bit kitsch, but Gaudi-inspired beauty is plain to see, and was enjoyed by both adults and kids alike. You could easily spend 30 minutes or 3 hours here, depending on how many tiles you want to examine!",
          "We went by ourselves to the city center to see these stairs. The very colorful tiles represent famous artist who wanted to jazz up this location and it be some an iconic landmark with tiles from locations from around the world. Go during the day and be very careful. It is a",
          "I went there by myself without any tours. Took uber early in the morning and arrived there and managed to capture many beautiful shots without people in the background. Nice arty farty place filled with murals..",
          "The steps are beautiful, covered in an eclectic mix of plain and picture tiles that range from the Simpsons through to international symbols. It\u2019s a real work of art. It\u2019s a bit of a slog to walk to the top but worthwhile to see the whole thing and for numerous photo",
          "Another must see in Rio, honoring a person who spend many years of his life to transform simple stairs connecting neighborhoods, into one of the most visited attractions in the city. When reaching the top, it was suggested to us to get back the way we came, rather than use the",
          "Must see in the city \ud83d\udc95 Beautiful mozaic stairs- kinda like in Barcelona. No other comment necessary here - just see it yourself \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Such a beautiful spot. Spent the afternoon sitting at the top of the stairs, drinking caipirinhas and listening to musicians play music",
          "It's so busy. Trying to get a good clear photo is impossible. The atmosphere is great. Walk right to the top. There were some guys playing good music. Rather than just taking photographs, look at the detail, it'a great. The story behind it is very sad. Try and go in the",
          "It was fun looking at different tiles and we made a looot of photos. We came from up the stairs, which was funny trying to find it.",
          "Its packed but It\u2019s a MUST see. The whole area even side walls are tiled and pretty we went twice during our Rio stay on different days just couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Go all the way up to see different mosaic patterns. Paying homage to different past and living icons. Do",
          "Really interesting place to visit, the stairs are beautiful. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a must go in Rio! The place can get crowded easily so probably visit early in the morning. But if you do get there when it\u2019s crowded everyone always tries to make a line for taking the famous stairs",
          "we did together with other attractions in the tour \" a day in Rio\" ... Nice, colorful, interesting area.",
          "Stairs lined with tiles of all colors, and an unmissable walk in Rio. This place can be made beautiful photos, My wife loved and my 5 year old son marveled at the colors. Besides being a super beautiful place, it is worth visiting and knowing a little more about the history of",
          "We came here by bike. Perfect below on the stairs. A lot of commercial things around and also very crowded. Just take your time",
          "We visited on a Sunday morning before the food market and it was extremely busy! There are lots of colourful mural paintings on the walls that lead up to the stairs. Be prepared to battle your way through crowds to walk up and down the stairs, there are people everywhere",
          "Fun area to explore. I really love the story behind these stairs... Escadaria Selar\u00f3n, 215 steps decorated by Chilean born artist Jorge Selar\u00f3n as a tribute to the Brazilian people. In 1990 Selar\u00f3n began decorating the dilapidated steps outside his house, he considered the work",

          "...to come here. It\u2019s an urban staircase decorated in pretty ceramic tiles with scores of tourists jostling one another to take selfies. If you are in the area or as part of a tour like we were then ok, but like I said, I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way.",
          "These are well worth visiting. Really unusual. There was a great atmosphere around the area and some great photo opportunities. Have seen a few questions about safety. I felt completely safe there most people were tourists.",
          "Did this visit as part of a group of locations so only had half an hour here which is enough time. This series of steps which are decorated with tiles from all around the world is a colourful display to see. The down side was that it was packed with people taking selfies so it",
          "We visited as part of the small group bike tour that leaves from Copocabana , which i highly recommend doing! The Steps were amazing, well worth a visit. Don't miss them .",
          "Wow how wonderful place to indulge the art and also knowing they story behind. A must go and see and we hade a guiding tour but for this place he left us so we could take pictures. Its a nice stop knowing that U2 and Pharell also been shooting video at the stair.",
          "Dropped by Selaron steps (Escadaria Selaron) on our way to Sugarloaf mountains. Really like this place even we only spent about 20 mins here. The steps were decorated by colourful tiles from around the world and there were plenty people sitting and posing on the steps. Selaron",
          "Colorful and beautiful! I was not able to travel to the top of the steps. Also beautiful grafitti art on the walk to the steps.",
          "He must adored Rio for the amount of time he put to lay all these tiles.If it is less crowded we could enjoy the details otherwise we view as an all",
          "According to our guide it\u2019s not the safest place to visit but it was fantastic. Tiles from around the world decorate the steps. Lots of people sitting and posing on the steps but a lovely place to visit",
          "The steps were ok but once you\u2019ve been here for 10 mins there is little else to do, my suggestion would be to visit if passing nearby or when visiting the Santa Teresa area of the city",
          "Amazing place! Very touristy and lots of people taking photos but the steps are beautiful. Lots of love music and a lovely chilled out vibe",
          "Very busy when I went to see the steps, couldn't really see the beautiful tiles at there full glory, a tight busy road to walk down to reach them. Best time to visit, at a guess would be the morning, not mid afternoon. To busy.",
          "Go there on a guided tour rather than on your own or take an Uber .A bit dodgy if you get lost .A must to say you were there",
          "I advise others to go as early as possible because it gets very congested on this narrow path quite quick. There\u2019s usually a queue of people that stop in front to take pictures and no one realizes how far up the staircase actually goes. So everyone\u2019s crowded at the bottom",
          "Great to see all the tiles from around the world, interesting the way it was put together. Don't be put off by the area it's quite safe. Again the selfie brigade hold things up a bit.",
          "This place is amazing!! The steps are a real work of art. You can see every country represented in the rules. I was able to see Africa represented. The steps are overcrowded though. If you find a space, just let your camera roll. The colours on the steps are beautiful. If",
          "I want to start off by saying that the steps are pretty cool and to think about the man hours that must have gone into it! Looking at the individual tiles and their messages from across the globe is almost a spiritual experience if you want it to be. For me though the area",
          "As part of our walking tour, we visited the Selaron Staircase. Jorge Selaron started by tiling the steps outside his small apartment in the Santa Teresa area of Rio in 1990 with fragments of blue, green and yellow tiles which were the colours of the Brazilian flag. It soon",
          "This location is definitely worth visiting. The range of images on the step way is fascinating. I'd like to have had a bit more info about why certain images and design were used. Again, the plethora of 'instagram' picture takers is frustrating, since individuals expect to be",
          "Must See pace, full of tourists, taking pictures of different tiles which came around the world to Mr Seleron, It took him years to make them.",
          "Chilean artist Jorge Selaron started - in 1990 with an idea to make his neighbourhood stairs (actually out front of his house) a bit more interesting, but it became a life passion, not finished until 2013. It really is an incredible place to visit, even if just to admire the",
          "We visited in April 2019 & what strikes you as you approach the steps are the amazing murals leading up to the stairs. This just adds to the colours of the stairs itself which are fairly steep. Not easy to get a photo as everyone is trying to get one especially where the Rio",
          "A beautiful colorful Brazilian experience, these steps are full of locals and tourists. I highly recommend this as a daytime excursion... you'll experience Brazil's diversity and possibly hear many languages too!",
          "I was really impressed when I saw this scale. Wonderful colours around you climbing or descending the steps. The houses on both sides seem part of the opera, perfectly integrated in this wonderful piece of art.",
          "This was such a fun spot to see with all these beautiful tile and the stairs! What a fun little part of Rio that is so artistic and expressive! Don\u2019t miss this little spot if you\u2019re in Rio. Make sure you Take advantage of going here!",
          "The stairs are a must see. I would recommend you approach them from the top and walk down the stairs if you are not fit enough because they are long and steep. it is advisable to visit late in the afternoon because morning and mid-day, the place is very crowded and you cant get",
          "I must be getting old. The selfie generation really spoilt this place. Sitting on steps and not letting anyone past. Just enjoy it with your eyes people. We enjoyed walking to the top but it was too crowded on a hot day. Be careful as the area was ok in the daytime but felt",
          "Rain was pouring at Corcovado, so our guide suggested to see Selaron Stairs meanwhile and....what a surprise!!! Unconventional colourful magnetic place. Don\u2019t miss it, expecially at down",
          "Our tour stopped here for a few minutes. We had expected just tiles on the steps; but there are also tiles on the sides. Most tiles are about 4\" x 4\" and each one appears to be a different design. It was crowded on Sunday afternoon, so we did not climb all the steps. It was",
          "Oh, my words one's trip to Rio is not complete if you haven't visited this masterpiece of art. selaron stair was the highlight of our trip to Rio. Very colouful, vibrant area if you can spend few hours each stairs has details information. You nay find a piece of your country if",
          "The nearest metro station to this is the Cinel\u00e2ndia Station on the green line. Around an 8 minutes walk from there should get you to the spot. Do make it to top where they have a wonderful Picture spot just at the curve of the steps. There are locals selling juices, ice cold",
          "Went during a break in the rain so there were not too many people there. Started at the bottom and worked our way up. Well worth a visit as there are tiles from all over the world.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Try to search a tile of your country since the artist visited 200 countries buying tiles for his art work. Best spot for a photo. I think it's a photogenic place, you go take pictures, drink a caipi and come back. That neighbourhood looks a bit unsafe",
          "This is quite a sight. Beautiful for anyone interested in photography. However heed the cautions of those travellers who have reviewed. We were the first there in the morning, and there was an unsafe atmosphere. Many intoxicated persons around, some sleeping on the side of the",
          "It was one of the most colourful visits. Tiled steps from all over the world are there. Very interesting concept but difficult to take pictures because too many people are climbing up and down.A must see in Rio.",
          "This mosaic staircase is not only iconic but a must see. The amount of work they put into this project is fantastic. You can find tiles from all over the world, so cool to climb the stairs and take in the view. Along the way they sell drinks and snacks and music playing. A",
          "Beautiful & vivid mosaic steps created by Chilean born artist. 215 steps in total. Best to go there before 9am as it gets very crowded later in the day. We traveled by subway from Copacabana Beach to Cinelandia station. 10min walk from there.",
          "The steps are so interesting. It is hard to get a good picture without people wondering into view but the tile work is SO Interesting. Also, be careful as this is a major tourist draw in a poorer part of Rio Centro. Watch your personal possessions.",
          "Very nice, all the stairs and walls are made with red, yellow and vibrant coloured tiles. Great photo opportunities.",
          "It not only about the popular place, which attracts the tourists, this is a chance to feel Rio and clibm 215 steps closer to understanding of this incredible city.",
          "Wow! What a place! Inspirational and colourful art work that makes you smile! Beautiful!!! Loved that place!!!",
          "We visited Escadaria Selaron as part of a tour, just for safety sake, that was a bit disappointing. I would suggest going early morning as it is too crowed to take proper photos in daytime. Be very patient and take a few quick but wide aperture photos so that you can later",
          "These beautiful steps covered with tiles from different parts of the world is a wonder. First time I went it wasn't as packed and it was the 2016 olympics, second time I went, there was a 30-45 minute waiting line and this was during Carnaval. Although there is plenty of space",
          "The steps themselves are fantastic . If you are the type to appreciate the dedication and like to look at all the different tiles . Great photos , although gets really crowded, so you have many people in the background . Negative It\u2019s a real workout to the top so don\u2019t do it",
          "We visited this site as part of tour, very crowded, steps very steep. While I understand that this work took this artist quite some time and was extremely unusual, not something that really appealed to me. The number of people that were there taking photos and blocking steps",
          "These steps are not beautiful ... but fun, colorful, surprising and great place for pictures. We went with two large 'children' and they loved every minute, climbing the stairs and steps on the sides. The fact that Snoop-Dog has recorded a music video and that numerous of",
          "Quick visit to the steps just for pictures! They're very artistic and high up! We enjoyed farofa ( a traditional Brazilian dish) and ate other things too!",
          "Great fun with a unique melange of almost all cultures in the world, very colorful and very lively with tourists from around the world each trying to take a capture next to the sign relevant to him....",
          "We were in Rio for Carnival and our hotel was just a 10 minute walk from these steps. We visited on our first afternoon in Rio and it was absolutely packed! Hardly able to see the steps for the huge crowds, but we took our time and waited for the crowds to part to take a few",
          "These steps are really cool but when we got there the neighborhood was very sketchy. We decided to take pictures next to the cab and leave. There were several policemen there but that still didn\u2019t make me feel comfortable. They are cool but they aren\u2019t the Spanish Steps!",
          "The neighbourhood is a little rough so I would recommend going as part of a tour. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "The stairs are the work of one man who wanted to make his surroundings more beautiful. He used ceramic tiles from all over the World. The result is amazing.",
          "I hadn't realised how many steps there were... Which now sounds ridiculous having been there. The mosaic tiling is brilliantly Intertwined with a multitude of images. We didn't have long as we were part of a tour and had got caught up in the Carnival traffic chaos so if you get",
          "Is very busy with both tourists locals and street vendors . Lively atmosphere .. older part of town with interesting building and lots of different types of people .. loud and fun Try the coconut water from the stalls so refreshing",
          "Just a funny street in Sta. Teresa, which is what is left of the colonial part of Rio De Janeiro. Nice walk around.",
          "Interesting tiles and design along the steps. Highlight is the kiosk manned by two beautiful ladies serving juices, caipirinha in the middle of the staircases. Caipirinha is so refreshing in the heat to support ones to go up the stairs.",
          "The Escadaria features tiles from all over the world and is a unique and worthwhile stop in Rio de Janeiro.",
          "Bit of a tourist trap ... probably nice if you can find a time of day when tourists aren\u2019t clambering over everything and hitting you over the head with their selfie sticks.",
          "A beautiful place to take some photos! Once we got all the way up a lady selling some food told us to go back down the same way because it was very dangerous to go to the back streets, so we went down the say way. There are some people selling souvenirs and caipirinhas on the",
          "This was beautiful! I absolutely love what these steps stand for. Mr. Selaron put tiles on these steps for free. With his OWN time and effort. As people got ot know about it- they mailed him tiles or brought them with them. He would replace the tiles as time went on. This area",
          "We visited the steps as part of a tour. Because we were there at lunchtime it was very busy with tourists taking photos and crowding the steps. Definitely worth seeing but if you have the option then go earlier in the day when it's probably less busy.",
          "We was taken by our guide here. A bit scary because you are at the very poor end of the city. But with all the tourist around and locals looking at us like we are mad taking pictures of steps decorated in tiles. Great experience first time tried the local drink caipirinha for a",
          "Could this be another example of one man's labor of love becoming a major attraction for the rest of the world in years to come?! Just as the Rock garden of Chandigarh has become a major tourist attraction in the north of India, what started out as one man's obsession to use",
          "It\u2019s very nice place, colourful with many street artists. It became one of the top attractions in Rio so it\u2019s crazy crowded",
          "I was in Rio many times and had not visited it. What I had missed! It is beautiful to stop to observe the tiles of very different places and origins.",
          "I took some amazing pics even though it was really crowded! I just wish it had a public toilet and more stalls selling souvenirs",
          "Many tourists visit the place. Walls and floors are impressive. Also buildings reflect Brazilian life and atmosphere. Visit and spend time.....",
          "We saw the steps on a Gray Line half day tour. They are very interesting, but I\u2019m glad we were there with a tour as it\u2019s a bit of a seedy area. We had a very good guide, Christine, she had a huge local knowledge which added to our enjoyment of this tour.",
          "What a wonderful site. Don\u2019t rush your visit there as each tile is unique. Take the time to seek out your favourite tiles. Mine were the Guns n Roses one and the Girl with the Pearl Earring. Go all the way to the top to see the Brazilian flag and another staircase up to the",
          "How enchanting this place is. We went around 5 pm, the tourist taking pictures were very relaxed giving each others time to appreciate and take pictures, there were some filming of a local afro-brazilian artists, so we could enjoy some batuque and Orisha dancing. The local",
          "We saw this twice, once first thing in the morning and once at lunchtime. At lunchtime you can't move for vendors and tourists so I would definitely go as early as possible - probably not during darkness as the area around it is a bit dodgy. As for the art, OK, lots of tiles",
          "Yes the tiles are fascinating and the artwork good, but very tatty imparts where tourists have torn away some of the tiles, they climb all over the sides knocking parts off and chipping the tiles. The area is quite scruffy, rather than bohemian, and the tourist tat stalls are",
          "This is a social media photo-worthy stop, as it provides an iconic bright artistic background that is instantly recognizable. We had fun checking out the individual tiles - some of which are from surprising places!",
          "A bucket list item that turned into an amazing trip when one delved into its history. Selar\u00f3n was indeed one of a kind and he brought life into a regular alley. It is advisable to engage and support the locals as one goes up the stairs with a purchase of a drink or snack. They",
          "Must visit if you are in Rio. It gets super busy so go early othwise you have to accept it is busy, and hard to take pictures.",
          "If you really want to see this I would advise to go very early in the day! We went there around lunch time and you only see people everywhere.",
          "I had to write a review because the Escadaria is listed as the #67 place to visit in Rio. This is wrong! It is a must-see! It won't take too long, but tack it onto your trip to Santa Teresa, Lapa or Downtown. Yes it is crowded so try and go on an off hour---or don't worry so",
          "What\u2019s better than visiting the place where the famous Pharrell and Snoop Dogg Video was filmed? The history about these phenomenal stairs and learning about the specific tiles obtained to create this masterpiece. It was fun to spend time admiring and taking photos. I even found",
          "Impossible to take a single picture even late night, has a great atmosphere but some dodgy people around, be aware!",
          "Good idea by the artist Selaron to cover the stairs and the sides of the street with colorful tiles. Great benefits for the neighborhood and many new visitors, who take selfies and might spend some of their vacation money. A must see attraction but not the most interesting in",
          "We got an uber from copacabana to miss the crowds, we arrived about 8.30am and there was only about 10 people on the steps. This was great as we could take our time and get plenty of photos without people being everywhere. We even went to the very top and had no issues. We left",
          "So being an artist, I couldn\u2019t WAIT to see these steps. It was included in a waking tour we did, but since we got there around 1300, it was so packed that we could hardly even see the steps. Disappointed, we tried again by getting there at about 0730 and it was empty! Only a",
          "I really like this place but during high season try to go early in the morning if you want to enjoy it and you don\u2019t wanna be waiting to take pictures in a line.",
          "This place is a hidden gem in Rio, we spent a lot of time here looking at the tiles and taking in the art. It\u2019s real good fun and there is food and other things around it to fill your time with.",
          "We did a free tour of Rio de Janeiro. The tour had seven stops and in my opinion the city doesn\u00b4t have many monuments or beautiful places, but these tiled stairs are beautiful and there was a good atmosphere there. So I would recommend to go there. But be careful and don\u00b4t go",
          "We loved this site so much that we went twice. We enjoyed the overall art of the steps it was fun trying to find certain tiles from different states and countries.",
          "We went on a tour around Rio. This place is very interesting. Unfortunately is really crowded and you are unable to get a full view of the stairs.",
          "I highly recommend going to the steps early in the day instead of the afternoon. Our tour started at 2p; between the line to take pics on the steps, and the people coming up/down in the way, it\u2019ll be almost impossible to get a good picture. Plus, it\u2019s not shaded so it won\u2019t be",
          "The staircase is an interesting composition, fruit of the \"lifelong\" labour of a rather peculiar character, Mr Selaron. He painstakingly decorated the staircase in his neighbourhood, collecting tiles from all over the world. Look out for something that would remind you of home.",
          "The tiles on the steps were very cool. Lots of sayings. Many many steps for me to climb. Geat place for photos.",
          "I don't recall the full story behind this incredibly colourful staircase; it's something about Escada Selaron gradually constructing / decorating the stairs with different tiles from all over the world over a period exceeding 20 years. The stairs go quite a long way up and",
          "We had to use the steps daily whilst in Rio as our apartment was at the top. The steps are bright and worth a visit. They're really close to Lapa as well, so lots to see in the area. Only a 10 minute walk from the Metra at Gloria.",
          "There is a lot of ppl taking pictures every second but the stairs are beautiful, colorful. Worth to visit. I would rather choose morning time, might be less ppl. And less hot \ud83d\ude35",
          "Mainly because they are famous as a result of the song Beautiful (Snoop & Pherell) it is fun to see the stairs. But in the end, it \u2018only\u2019 is a decorated set of stairs, which can best be used to walk the Santa Teresa neighborhood to have a drink and bite.",
          "When on a city tour, we paid visit to \"the steps\". The colorful tiles are beautiful, and the history behind the creator was very informative. Every visitor to Rio should stop and have their photo taken sitting on the Selaron steps.",
          "This place is incredible! The steps themselves were much bigger than we expected and of course we had to climb them all the way to the top. We didn't have much time here, but could have easily spent a few hours looking at all the tiles. It was busy, but tourists were generally",
          "One of the more unusual sights, a staircase and its side walls covered in coloured tiles from around the world. A rather unusual tourist attraction but it does draw the crowds and brings the tourist economy into a rather run down community. During the day with lots of people",
          "A visit to these steps is just so much fun. It is hard to imagine someone attaching all these tiles . The effect is pretty incredible. Art is art!",
          "This was included in the guided tour I booked. To be honest I was unsure what this was but glad we stopped here. The tour guide explained the step and how long it took to construct. It was very busy as it is a very popular attraction The steps were crowded so hard to bet up",
          "Well worth a visit when in Rio, the steps go up a fairly steep hill buts it's worth the climb if you are able to do so. It does get fairly busy around the spot where people like to take photos but there appears to be some form of queuing system.",
          "Artist collected and was sent tiles from all over the world and incorporated into an alley way stair case. History of government efforts to destroy and refusal to support maintenance is also very interesting",
          "You might visit Rio to see Sugar Loaf and Christ the Redeemer but you will remember these steps for a long time as well. I expected something colourful and touristy. It was colourful but I was really captivated by the cheery atmosphere on the steps. The tiles come from all",
          "Wish we went really early, to avoid crowds. It is fantastic, lots of opportunity for photos. Ideal to both take large view and then really spend time looking at all the tile details. Can combine with aqueduct, tram ride, check out Lapa, or Santa Teresa.",
          "The Escadaria is definitely worth a visit. Get a caipirinha at the bottom and take your time climbing up the stairs admiring the different tiles. You\u2019ll most likely find one from places you\u2019ve been to, know or even your country.",
          "We visited the area with our group. The stairs are very colorful with many different tiles from all over the world. It's very crowded near the bottom with everyone taking pictures.",
          "If this type of street art is your thing then by all means make it part of your wish list, but we did it as part of our day tour which is a good way to see it. I thought the area wasn't the most salubrious. You can try and spot Selaron in a couple of the tiles (or of his",
          "On visiting Rio for the first time in May, the Selaron steps were on our must see list. On visiting the steps, the area was extremely busy but is a vibrant, colourful area full of atmosphere, artists and lots of things to see. The steps are made up of lots of different",
          "215 steps and surrounding walls covered by tiles collected by Jorge Selaron. Tiles from all over the world and probably from your hometown. Some painted by himself. Definitely worth the walk.",
          "Part of a Viator Rio de Janeiro City tour we booked, our guide gave us a fairly in-depth look at the artists life. Selaron moved to the Lapa district in the 80\u2019s. He began renovating the steps outside his studio when his usual muse escaped him. As his name grew, he solicited",
          "Very colorful and picturesque stairs, one of better attractions around Centro. Local artists and artisans come here to advertise their creations. Area around is a bit shabby and soggy though, so o would recommend to visit during day hours.",
          "Many people, and very hot. But these steps are worth a visit. Try to spot a tile your country gave, if you have the time and patience",
          "The famous stairs from Snoop and Pharell's video. was crowded but there are times when you can actually take good picturws without million ppl in the background:)",
          "Beautiful work of art built over many years. But be safe. Stay near the bottom where all the people are.",
          "Well worth a visit to marvel at this crazy man's life achievement to cover a dull set of steps in colourful tiles from around the world. Go early - mid morning to beat the crowds and look at the amazing collection.",
          "Really impressive tile work and very colourful would recommend going along and having a look if close by. We got the tram up and then got off on way back, only short walk from viaduct stop. The area is very rough on the streets you have to walk to get there did not feel entirely",
          "Nice St Theresa neighborhood. Great relaxed environment Crowd is also okay but be alert about pickpockets.",
          "We got there just the first day, as we were staying in Lapa. It\u2019s a place full of crowds, one must pay attention to your belongings, just like in every place of that kind. The stairs are beautiful and indeed give a great vibe to the place.",
          "Fabulous tiles on the steps and sides. Worth stopping at intervals and looking at individual tiles, so interesting. There seemed to be tiles from all over the world. Some tiles made designs, like the map of Africa, others spelled out words. Very colourful, felt safe it was just",
          "Touted by some as the larges mosaic artwork done by a single artist, this is an amazing stair. From the bottom looking up you see this vividly colored masterpiece. But form the top looking down, it just looks like gray stone stairs. Spend some time and find a tile form your",
          "This was a truly a unique place to visit! These stairs were created by a Chilean Artist dedicating these stairs to the people of Brazil. It took this Jorge Selar\u00f3n (the artist) 23 years to complete this work, which is now recognized as an art piece, as it was featured in many",
          "Great art decorating stairs with tiles from all corners of the world Great for pictures and great attraction , lots of people visiting",
          "A highlight of the Rio walking tour these steps are a fun stop. Seleron spent years changing an ordinary city stairway to a colorful tiled achievement. Great spot for photos and to simply take in his artistic achievement.",
          "We were told to be very careful in this area due to pickpockets & also not to wander to far up the stairs because it was dangerous. It was very crowded so it was nerve racking making sure no one was trying to stay anything. The stairs were very interesting & the amount of work",
          "i was taken here by a friend, well not much to see actually. the place is dirty, and there is nothing particularly nice to see except for lots of dirty tiles. ok some may say that this is street art..... mmhhhh cannot really disagree, but unless you go there for a selfie , for",
          "This is well worth the stop and we were lucky enough that it wasn't that busy, but if you are interested in a selfie on the 'rio' labelled spot, there is a line. We went past the line to go up and a lot of grumbling from the line that they thought they had exclusive to hog the",
          "Dont expect to see a Miracle, they are just Stairs that are covered with colourful Ceramic but they look Beautiful! And you feel the authenticity in them. When you are there, don\u2019t get off track as the neighborhood is not that safe, specially girls taking photos of every single",
          "this is an incredibly popular place where there are thousands of tiles everywhere from all over the world. Go early, if possible, because later it will be very hard to sit on the steps to take of pictures of yourself with the tiles below that read: Rio de Janeiro. Some people",
          "My sister and I went to Escadaria Selaron we loved it but my god it\u2019s not organized nor safe whatsoever but it\u2019s great art",
          "I loved this place! It was busy with tourists, street vendors, residents etc. You could, for a few minutes, picture life in the lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods...but jazzed up with art and bursts of bright colours. The artists vision is commendable!",
          "What started off as a small decoration of steps ended up being a massive project from tiles from all over the world. Now world famous and to see this colorful work of art was a great experience. Fairly busy and had no problems in taking photos as queues were formed in various",
          "Escadaria Selar\u00f3n or Selaron\u2019s steps have times from all over the world. It was fun to look for one from my country. If you go with one of the walking tours, then you get to hear the story. We went twice - at night with Strawberry Free Lapa by night walking tour and again in the",
          "We went here with a group. It is quite unique and one of the things to see in Rio. We were told to go as a group due to the Santa Teresa falava not being as safe as it once was.",
          "This was truly a labor of love. It's evident the moment you walk up and look at the details of these steps. Chilean artist Jorge Selar\u00f3n dedicated this work to the people of Brazil. But he also included tiles from all over the world so we can each find a piece of ourselves here,",
          "Very touristy but still worth a visit. Colourful and great to take pictures. The area has its own charm different from rest of Rio. Also known as the 'Selaron Steps', is a set of world-famous colourfully tiles steps in Rio de Janeiro. They are the work of Chilean-born artist",
          "We came about 3pm and it was busy. I think you just have to accept that it\u2019s busy all the time unless you go really early? Personally I don\u2019t see the point in doing that, the amount of people make a good atmosphere. Also I\u2019m not sure if we got lucky/a good crowd but there was a",
          "I have been here several times, but most recently with my mom. This was her first time to Brasil and she wanted to see Rio. We took a weekend trip here, and she loved the steps. She spent over an hour looking for different tiles and was ecstatic to find ones from her home",
          "The different tiles give a wide picture of all the people who have passed through here.we loved the stairs.",
          "The steps are fantastic to see and the story of their creation is even more spectacular. This is a must see in Rio",
          "I'd recommend this place as one of the places you have to go to if you're in Rio. It's a popular tourist destination, though - so beware of petty theft!",
          "We went on a rainy Tuesday thinking it would be a little less crowded. We were wrong. But it was too be expected. These are beautiful and I think a must see while in Rio. The only cost is the cab ride, which was 30 reals roughly from Copacabana. We got some amazing pictures.",
          "This is community art at its best. From a thoughtfully conceived idea, this set of steps provides a mix of individual tiles to montages and a thoughtful polemic on favelas. Talk a slow and thoughtful walk up the steps looking at the eclectic nature of the tiles.",
          "The staircase is long and very very busy - full of tourists. It is interesting and there are a few photo opportunities but there is nothing to do there once you have walked up and back down again",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to escadaria selaron. The history of it and to look at all the tiles is so interesting. If you\u2019re in Rio you really should see the stairs and maybe you discover tiles from your country",
          "These steps were amazing and also the story behind them. Walk right to the top to get away from the crowds at the bottom. Wasn't expecting too much but we were thrilled by this attraction.",
          "Colourful , joyful place. Nice to take pictures , touristy place as usual. Nice Place! This crazy and colorful tiled stairway is the work of Chilean artist Jorge Selar\u00f3n, self-taught. 215 steps that he entirely covered with majolica collected in urban areas of Rio or donated",
          "The art is cool with brief history of the stairs and sad fact that the artist committed suicide a few years ago. Worth the stop if you have time but in a rougher part of town (still will be safe).",
          "This is another must visit place for Rio, but as expected there are people everywhere. Be patient and wait for the right time and you will be fine.",
          "It\u2019s beginning to be one of the most famous landmarks in Rio but at the moment it\u2019s not as busy yet. Beautifully coloured steps only a few minutes walking away from Gloria metro station. The area itself looks quite rough but well worth it!",
          "Yes you really should visit Escadaria Selar\u00f3n, walk them all the way up to the top and go further into Santa Teresa and enjoy the views and cosyness of the area. The street in front is already a great entrance with the graffiti-art (yes, really art) and the steps are just a",
          "This is a really beautiful site to visit in Rio and definitely worth doing for anyone who is in the city!",
          "I never saw this place on any things to do in Rio but saw it on the free walking tour. Amazing work by one man to create something special. Should be promoted more as something unique to rio",
          "It\u2019s a really cool place, because of its story and being so picturesque became a must when in Rio, but for the same reason it\u2019s too crowded!! If you want a nice picture without making the line, would try and go there first in the morning.",
          "If you go all the way to Rio, don\u2019t leave without visiting the steps. A glorious tribute to the whole world nestled at the foot of Santa Teresa. A staircase made with tiles from all the corners of the earth and there\u2019s no place else, like this anywhere!",
          "These stairs are a really cool thing to see in Rio... as a bonus, there is a lot of street art nearby as well. The stairs go up about 30 flights and have some very unique tiles in them. For the most part, the people here are orderly, forming a line at the bottom of the stairs",
          "This is really a one off and a work of art showing a selection of tiles from around the world. Absolutely beautifully done - I only hope that someone maintains this for future generations to enjoy the work of Jorge Selaron.....",
          "It\u2019s is a shame to have to reiterate what many have said about Rio but you do need to stay aware of your environment. This place in many ways is less publicised than some of the more iconic Rio landmarks but it is a must if you want to see a different side of Rio. I was",
          "It is an Iconic tour in an Iconic zone of RIO it is a must, stay as long as possible, take your time to do the \"Scalinada\". And feel RIO as really is. You can get there by taxi better because they'll leave you to the base of \"Scalinada\", it's the safest way. But you may also",
          "The place is photogenic and \"insta-worthy\" as others would say. but be very cautious, especially on the upper parts where the tiles with brazilian flag is. I was mugged on that spot yesterday (aug 21) in the middle of the day (2pm) with lots of people around. There are two of",
          "We are British. We went to the top where the Brazil Mosaic Flag is to take pictures. After this there is one more flight of stairs but we were told not to go right to the top and to stay at the flag. I am travelling with 4 year old daughter and husband. By the Mosaic Brazilian",
          "We went here as a last minute decision and really enjoyed it. It\u2019s worth taking a bit of time to look closely at many of the interesting tiles. A word of warning, there were many people there when we went so it felt safe but there were groups of men along the road only 50 m from",
          "We went early in the morning and skipped the crowds and was worth it. We came back in the afternoon to some of the restaurants nearby and saw the hordes of people on the stairs, and we\u2019re glad we didn\u2019t show up at that timr.",
          "The steps are certainly worth visiting. They are pretty from a distance and close by. But when crowded they are less interesting.",
          "Lots of colorful tiles from around the world created and maintained by Chilean artist Selaron. So many tiles it's hard to take it all in and fully appreciate the passion it took to create this. Fun thing to do!",
          "Beautiful rendition and use of materials. Wear good shoes. Support local artists carving names on keys.",
          "I loved the colorful tiles surrounding the stairways. Great place for pictures and admiring the art. Truly an artistic masterpice",
          "This is an interesting hotspot to visit. The Chilinean artist, Jorge Selar\u00f3n,has begun this project in the early 90s. One might actually feel all this cheerful energy going around the place, probably beacuse of its colours and designs... Visitors should not expect to take",
          "This place wasn't really on our radar initially but after a few days in Rio we decided to check it out. This is really a must-see! The stairs are beautiful, great for taking pictures, with beautiful artwork, stairs, and murals. You are right near the Santa Teresa neighborhood so",
          "We visited just before the carnival so boys in tutus and other disguised people added to the colors of this incredible place. Tiles come from the entire world.",
          "Vibrant and colorful, this staircase has a rich history and contributions from all over the world. The people watching is some of the best ever- people posing, taking selfies, exclaiming over familiar tiles, it was the best!",
          "These steps are so colourful its amazing. Make sure to look for the ceramic from your country, it might take you double the time than it took you to take the necessary pics of the stairs, but it will be worth it, especially if you come from a small country like mine ....",
          "Cant belive that one man did this on his own. So much fun for our boys to klimb around the sides of the stairs, we had fun to look at all the tiles from around the world, an explotion of colors. After the stairs we wandered around the Streets in the ares- really fantastic with",
          "Escadaria Selar\u00f3n: Jorge Selar\u00f3n was a Chilean artist, born in 1947 who built the iconic stairs, called Escadaria Selar\u00f3n (Selaron Steps) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and became famous world over for his dedicated art work. He was a world traveler, a painter, and a ceramic artist.",
          "This is a beautiful and iconic place to visit in Rio de Janeiro. I suggest going there while visiting Lapa and then walk the stairs and continue on to Santa Teresa which also has many nice places worth visiting. Tiles are donated from around the world and there are many details",
          "While the story of the steps is a remarkable one, we all agreed that we would not stop there a second time. The artist did an amazing job and it is certainly worth going to see once.",
          "Great place, not adequate for kids or teenagers during carnivals. Lots of drunk people around. And a suspicious smell of... The place is beautiful though. I wish I went in other time to actually enjoy it more.",
          "We went based on the recommendation of friends, this is a must see in Rio! This is a real piece of art and a great opportunity for photos.",
          "Visited lots of many different colours was and interesting place to see well worth a visit. Can get busy though get in early to beat the crowd.",
          "Interesting place, crowded, ti take a photo you stay in line for good 20-15 min. We went also at night and it not very safe.and not so clean. But it is a place you must see being in Rio.",
          "What a beautiful and unique place this is ! In a quite quiet borough, in low-season, you can easily take few pictures of you, your family and friends without any other people on the photo ! This is and emotional life-dedicated artwork.",
          "In the main down town area, you can easily reach by taxi. The artist really makes the ordinary stairs with such amazing creativity and make the whole area memorable.",
          "It's a nice place to go if you are in Lapa walking around. I would suggest you go during daytime (the city centre isn't that safe at night). Very colourful staircase. A must!",
          "As sad as it sounds I enjoyed the steps the most in Rio. It was chilled out and plenty of time to take a photo without people getting in the way. We went in the middle of the day and it was still chilled. Only thing is once you\u2019re done you\u2019re done, there isn\u2019t much else around",
          "This was the last stop on my bike tour with Rio by Bike. It is not in a safe neighborhood, so I recommend you visit on a tour! In a group, I felt perfectly safe, especially with an experienced guide. I loved the story of the steps, their creator, and his art.",
          "Very nice little walk. Takes about 90 minutes to appreciate each tile from top to bottom. I was happy with the explanation tiles in both Portuguese and English at the bottom. It was enough information for me to avoid having to pay a tour guide for it.",
          "Really interesting place and lovely colors. Try to be careful though, some pick pockets will be watching so just protect your stuff. Other than that, i liked the place a lot!",
          "The idea was from the Chilean artist Selaron. The most diverse and whimsical tiles from all over the world decorate the steps and the walks beside them. You can even find a Barak Obama tike near the bottom! Just a colorful and fun place to scramble around!",
          "Quite organised considering it\u2019s a free for all. There\u2019s a queue to have a solo photo on the steps. And you can climb on the tiles before to keep you entertained. We waited about 15mins to get a photo and swapped over had one each and a couple together and nobody blinked an",
          "The steps are in Lapa and worth a visit. Created by the artist Jorge Selaron, whose self portraits show him pregnant with breasts.... an interesting concept!! There are 215 steps and walls decorated with tiles that Selaron received as gifts from the globe. A major tourist and",
          "We read the reviews and were not disappointed. It\u2019s great colourful tiles from all over the world. These steps are a fun thing to see in Rio.",
          "We visited this place for the comments in trip advidor, right at the foot of a fabela, in the neighborhood of Lapa, work by the artist Jorge Selaron, beginning in 1990 and ending with his death in 2013, 215 steps and walls covered in ceramics given to the artist and bought.",
          "Our tour group stopped here for 15 minutes to admire the tile artistry of Selaron. It\u2019s so colorful it makes you smile! There are tiles from all over the world. Now I want to go home and start tiling my patio area like this.",
          "No need to rush and get there early on, we got there mid-day and although there was a lot of people you can still take photos, and at the bottom of the stairs there\u2019s a line to get a picture with the part that says \u201cRio de Janeiro\u201d. Not much to do in that area asides from",
          "Probably this is the most unique stairway you will ever visit. All of the 215 steps are paved with brightly colored tiles, not just on the treads and risers but also along the sides, with tiled benches where you can sit or climb. The project was started by Chilean artist Jorge",
          "Fascinating but can get busy. We went at 9 am and could enjoy the steps with very few people to be able to really appreciate the range of tiles collected.",
          "Truly amazing to see the intricate tiled stairs. You could spend a good amount of time looking at all of the tiles and wondering about the inspiration. Bring your sneakers, good amount of walking.",
          "We are family of 4 and visited Lapa steps as a part of the downtown tour. The steps are colorful and it was nice to see the tiles from many countries. Go there if you have time. If not it is okay to give it a miss. There were not too many people and we were able to climb the",
          "Worth a visit, our guide for the day included this which I loved. Took over 20 years to do, one man on his own. Very quirky.",
          "In heart of downtown Rio, lapa bohemian hood was home of this so talented chilean artist, Mr Jorge Selaron, great imported carioca, as so many foreigners that fall in love for this amazing soup of beauty and caos. Welcome and take car, because the biggest danger to face in get",
          "We went late afternoon on a sunday. Not too crowded and a nice experience. We felt not safe to continue uphill to santa teresa.",
          "This amazing stairs are just something so special which bring all the unique character of this country! Each step has special thoughts and drawings which are just so beautiful you cannot help reading and looking at. I took an amazing picture on the Escadaria and every time I",
          "Found this place to be a bit busy but worth the trip. If you have time in Rio, check it out, it is quite unique. Found a tile with Kazakhstan which must have been placed there by Borat lol.",
          "We went here as a part of city tour and were delighted to be there. It is in the middle of a favela and our guide told us to be very very careful! There is no entrance fee and you can spend as much time as you want. So many countries are represented in this small and beautiful",
          "I didn\u2019t have high expectations for this place given many reviews of the crowdedness but having come here on a Monday morning (not peak time) it was surprisingly not crowded and very interesting to explore in detail. If you are more interested in taking photos do yourself on",
          "Must-see and really great to walk. No entrance fee thus you can come whenever you want. As an early bird (7-8 AM) you will have few people... afterwards it's just super crowded. For nice picture opportunities during peak time walk all the way up - most people remain at the 3-4",
          "The steps are very unusual and decorated with a range of tiles from all over the world. At the base the artist put a set of tiles explaining in Portuguese and English what he was doing.",
          "This is such a beautiful simple place to see... It is such a shame though that the perimeter is surrounded by obscure environment. I did not feel safe going there, specially at night... Would not recommend anyone to go there alone, and to be very alert at all times... But again,",
          "We saw the stairs twice on our trip. First in the afternoon around 2pm\u2013 when it was packed with people! And once before 8 in the morning\u2013 when there was no one around! Getting free reign to enjoy the steps and take pictures without getting in someone\u2019s way was a much better",
          "We visited these famous stairs after seeing so many photos of people on the internet. When we got there, it was pretty packed for a Monday early afternoon but we were able to get some good photos.",
          "A good alternative stop ! Interesting story about Selaron. While not in the same league as Corcovado, Sugarloaf et al a worthwhile piece of Rio\u2019s tapestry.",
          "I can't believe that I had never heard of these steps before we went to Rio - the Escadaria Selaron or \"Selaron Steps\" created by the artist Jorge Selaron, a Chilean by birth. Some time after moving to Rio, he decided to renovate the steps in front of his house beginning in",
          "A little hidden in Rio in the neighborhood Gl\u00f3ria you find this beautiful part, so colorful and a very interesting place. Above the stairs you end up in one of Rio\u2019s Favela but this one is one of the nicer and safer one. Although you must be a little careful in Rio I never felt",
          "I visited the steps 3 times at different times of the day, I recommend going early to avoid the crowds. The tiles are beautiful and so interesting and different. Each time I visited I saw something new. There were tiles from all over the world and several varieties. I really",
          "Really, be smart and don't act like a Teletubbie exposing your wallet, camera or cellphone around this area. It is one of the most dangerous areas for tourists! It is beautiful but open your eyes at Lapa and the areas nearby.",
          "These are famous in Rio they are pretty and colourful and been in some famous music videos etc etc the man who done all the work was an artist from Chile he would give his art away for free if you didn\u2019t want to or couldn\u2019t pay for it the area is buzzing and worth a stop",
          "Myself and husband visited here twice. It is very busy with lots of tourists but you are able to get photos no problem. The amount of work that one man put into it is amazing. Definetly recommend going.",
          "A piece of art made by one man only. Selaron was born in 1947 and came to Brazil in 1983 after visiting more than 50 countries. Decided to change the staircase, he used to live beside it, and never stopped his work. Received hydraulic glazed tiles and other types of tiles from",
          "You don\u2019t have to go far to see this beauty of work if you\u2019re staying in Lapa. And even if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s definitely worth the visit",
          "This is a very nice place. Not only you can take some nice pictures there you can also take a lot of time to check the tousands of tiles there. Probably you will find one near where you are from, as there are so many of them. By the way: to get there you'll probably need",
          "Caught the metro from Copacabana Beach (Cantagalo stop to Cinelandia))which was very easy 5-10 min walk and 4.30BR each way so very cheap. It is easy to do this yourself and do not need to take a tour and much cheaper that way as close to the aqua duct too for walking around.",
          "This was good to visit but glad didn\u2019t go on my own . We went with the Free Walking Tour of Rio people - safety in numbers. The area looked a bit \u201cspicy\u201d so if visiting on your own take care with your personal possessions and don\u2019t go wandering down empty side streets. Ps we",
          "Escadaria Selar\u00f3n is a staircase used to access the higher neighborhood of Santa Teresa from below, it is a short cut, however the chilean artist Jorge Selar\u00f3n, treated it as a masterpiece and put his soul in every step. It is very intrincate and sometimes too busy, but worth",
          "It is a mix of art and curious way to do something that will be recognized with time as a symbol of your community. Colored plates and a high stair for you to walk and enjoy.",
          "This place is a perfect picture spot! The story behind the steps is very interesting! Though I would not go there without a tour- the area is a tad dangerous with pickpockets and robbers :(",
          "The stairs are colorful. Each piece positioned to create a master piece. Walk up the and view the colors from the top.",
          "Near Lapa this place is situated in what some may consider a sketchy neighborhood. We came here on a city tour with \u201c Jeep Tour\u201d you can seriously spend 30-45 minutes here but we were only given 20 minutes! These works famous Brazilian Steps are worth the visit. The tiles have",
          "Stopped here for 30 minutes and my wife loved the photo opportunities. Nice area and pretty popular stop off for Rio. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good visit option if you have time!",
          "This simply stairway was transformed in a unique art masterpiece completely integrated on the historical urban area. Vivid colours give a new life to an ancient place transforming it in a center of life with a lot of good vibrations.",
          "A short stop here is worth it. The stairs are covered with tiles collected by an excentric guy from around the world. Interesting graffiti can also be seen nearby. If it gets hot, the local corner bar has really cold beers...just what the doctor order.",
          "The stairs are a piece of art. There were so many people sharing it and going up and down it lookes like a party was going on. You can find people selling snacks and beer from their homes located by the stairs.",
          "Cool story behind the tiles. Colorful. A fun spot to take pictures. Bars at the bottom of the stairs. Packed with tourists, usually.",
          "This place is worth a brief visit . It's interesting to find a tile from your own country. I felt it is an area where you have to be careful about your belongings.",
          "Easy walk from Cinlandia Metro, under Arcos Aquaduct in the interesting Bohemian Lapas neighborhood.",
          "This freewalk was amazing. The guide told us everything about Rio s history ,about Rio s cultural life,about the people and showd us so many hidden things in the center;but he showd us the tourisic points like Escadaria Serlon,the cathedral and many other things too.. I",
          "The steps of Selaron represents a very non-traditional form of art which attracts loads of tourists with its bright colors. In the upper part, left side, there is a small shop that sells tiles or clocks made from tiles with your image imprinted on it in less than 5 minutes. A",
          "Easiest way to get there is to take and Uber or taxi. Be prepared for a big crowd. The bottom steps are the worst. The higher you get, the better pictures you can get. It won\u2019t take you long to visit this place unless you want to look at each tile closely. The tiles are from",
          "This is a vibrant tourist attraction in a very interesting neighborhood. It was Carnival, so the streets were packed with revelers and vendors. Grab a caipirinha, and be prepared to compete with many tourists and locals for each picture spot.",
          "The steps are lined with colorful tiles. Have fun figuring out the stories behind each tile as you go up the steps.",
          "Wow! The Selaron steps are spectacular! It is a must stop. There is also a very good curio shop close by if you want to buy some gifts!",
          "This was a stop on the city tour and of course packed with tourists and few locals flogging their wares. Climbing up the crowd is thinning out most likely due to the warnings by the guides yhst past half way it is not safe. It is interesting but not much explanation as to why",
          "An extraordinary concept. Tiles from different parts of the world. It\u2019s amazing that one can create such beauty through an idea. Don\u2019t miss a visit to this place.",
          "So many different styles and patterns. Each tile could tell a story.Gets very busy with visitors,so maybe get there early.",
          "The steps are very crowded & very steep, but well worth the visit to see them. Be sure to see the tile which has a picture of the artist on it. Almost overwhelming with so many tiles to see.",
          "My girlfriend and I got a taxi to the steps early in the day (around 8:30am) as we were aware that the steps get VERY busy. It was a perfect time to go - we were able to take great pictures and it was only when we were leaving that the mini buses began to arrive with tourists",
          "This is situated in Lapa...it is very busy when I visited however this presents for me what Rio is all about, vibrant, colourful, historic, beautiful and SEXY!!",
          "Every major city has its special... one of a kind attraction. This may be Rio's. Not iconic like Christ the Redeemer but still unique to this place. Defies description. Funky Bohemian Arty Historic Fabulous!",
          "We had a quick stop in this colorful neighborhood to walk fast through the smelly street to reach the tile steps and take picturesque. The art work is amazing. I wish we had more time to walk through the streets but were advised not to. Some of the old mansions are restored into",
          "Worth a trip, careful of locals trying to \"help\". Beautiful Steps with 2000 different types of tiles. Photo opportunity beautfies this Favela area.",
          "This is not a Must of Rio De Janeiro but something that could complete your visit in this city! You will immerse in the colour of Brazil! Beautiful!",
          "The colourful steps and ambiance are a welcome delight in the rather drab environment. Take the tram to Sta Teresa and walk backwards to Lapa, you find spectacular views and descent the cheerfully decorated steps. They will take your eyes off the sad historic houses along the",
          "Wow what a beautiful and creative concept. Lovely tale to it too. Lots of curio shops around the area.",
          "Rather amazing what one man could do, tiles from all over the world put together to create an artwork, no many come across",
          "You will find a lot of tiles from all over. Some tips go. As early as possible as it gets packed with people. Do not go late afternoon. The area is not desirable you will find a lot of homeless people. Stick to main streets only.",
          "If you have a moment in Rios, this spot is well worth a visit. There are 100's of tiles to make it worth while for all tastes. Tiles of all kinds...interesting, cool, cheesy, beautiful,arty,ugly, etc,etc. I visited the spot with a tour guide but there were lots of people there",
          "Probably one of the highlights of my Rio visit was the Escadaria Selar\u00f3n. The beautiful stairs scale all the way up to the base of a favela (get there early and don\u2019t go there past 3/4pm) and show the artful timing of a Chilean artist. If you want to get good photos go there",
          "One can't go to Rio without going to the Selaron Stairs and taking in their beauty and artfulness. GO early to take in the beauty without the crowd. Stand at the bottom and look up and take a deep breathe, close your eyes and you can feel Selaron, the mad artist that gave us",
          "Very busy but still very special You need to que for a nice photo but it is worthy wait...head up and reach santa teresa guimares little square to feel uniqe spirit of santa teresa narrow structure and if You climb even higher you get to see amazing view on rio CENTRO part.",
          "A mosaic built across a grand staircase, this is a living art installation- the Chilean artist has collected tiles from all over the world and continues to build into it. Fantastic! Also has a very civilised queue at the bottom for those looking for the perfect picture!",
          "We enjoyed it, it\u2019s v Brazilian eg lots of colour, fun, bright and plenty of photo ops. It was busy when we went but not massively so. My top tip would be to get dropped off at the top of the stairs, then in the sweaty heat you don\u2019t have to walk up the steep stairs and it\u2019s",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit and so local. Try to get your tour guide to drop you at the top to walk down, as up leaves you no where and is a very steep climb. Each tile comes from a different country and is really a wonder to behold!",
          "Thiis amazingly colourful stairs, created by the chilenean artist Selaron is probably the best hotspot to shot a profile picture in Rio: must visit!",
          "Go hunting for a tile from your country. It's another must in Rio, but the area on top of the stairs is according to what we heard not the safest, so stick to the stairs and the area below.",
          "I originally went to see the Selaron Steps because Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams shot portions of the \u201cBeautiful\u201d video there. Once I got there, however, it was very easy to get wrapped up in the history of how the steps came to be. The only thing that I hate is that it\u2019s so",
          "This is a place you must visit when you visit Rio. Take a Taxi or even better an Uber, a Bus can't go down the narrow streets leading to the Escadaria Selaron. Most tourist only go up 2 - 3 stairs, but go all the way to the top, after the first 3 stairs tourist are less, and it",
          "I was amazed to see so many ceramic tiles from all over the world, reflecting all the cultures, religions, ethnic images, languages, etc. but it is not in a good neighbourhood and be careful if you go there alone!",
          "Worth taking the time to visit go early since it is not a safe area. The history sorounding why Jorge Selaron started this project its amazing great photo \ud83d\udcf8 opportunities I loved it",
          "Stopped off to see these ceramic covered stairs on our tour of central Rio and it was well worth the short walk. The colours and styles from all over the world create an incredible stairway that brightens the entire area. Be aware it is a pretty seedy area and lots of homeless",
          "This place is often visited, because a single man did a special place only with his hands, creativity and dedication",
          "We stopped here on our way to lunch, and I'm glad I got to finally see the Escadaria Selaron in person. Yes it was extremely busy, but this is to be expected. We made the effort to walk right to the top, where there was a lot less people, and you are able to get much better",
          "I visited these stairs as part of a tour by C2 Rio tours. These stairs are beautiful and remind me of the Spanish steps in Rome. There are tiles from all over the world, and I found a tile from Canada. What fun!",
          "With a very interesting history, selaron is one this places you cant leave without visiting. Go all up and you\u2019ll get some great views from the city.",
          "Needless to stay that this is a great spot for pictures! Take your time and have a closer look at the tiles. You may find your Home Country, Home City or simply a beautiful quote in your language. We arrived in the afternoon when it was full of people. One tourist even",
          "These vibrant tiles tell a lot of stories; each stunningly hand painted by a Chilean artist through different phases in his life. Located on a touristy area off the city, they're not hard to find. Most walking tours will take you via them. You can spend up to an hour here if you",
          "watch the video on u-tube, beautiful Rio by Snoop Dogg, the Escadaria is better in person then in the video but it will give you an idea. It doesn't cost anything but makes for great photo's! Purchase a hot plate with a photo of you on the steps for $20, one of the better",
          "What a fun place to visit. The walk to the stairs go through an eclectic Bohemian area. We enjoyed the street and wall art. The steps are colorful. Take time to find tiles from your country or city. Can be quite busy!",
          "We had a fab visit here. Such a beautiful place to be, teeming with atmosphere. A must see on anyone\u2019s Rio trip",
          "This is a huge and unique colorful stair. It is made of colorful ceramic tiles with a unique design. 215 steps, easy to find, close to city center and the pictures are usually awesome.",
          "There are about 250 steps covered in brightly colored tiles from all over the world, crowded with people taking selfies. The area is run down and the staircase is really the only reason to visit. It's a fun place, unlike anything I've seen anywhere else, and definitely worth a",
          "We visited Escadaria Selaron early on a Sunday morning and we were the only people there so we managed to get some great photos. Not sure what is it like later on, if busy may not have the same impact",
          "definitley go see these steps, loads of tourist so go early, the mosiacs and tiles are beautiful, enjoy the area",
          "It\u2019s impressive to see how dull street steps could be converted into a magnificent piece of art. A tribute to the Brazilian people, the 215 steps of the Convent of Santa Teresa is a gift from Jorge Selar\u00f3n.",
          "Try and go when it is quiet otherwise the stairs are littered with stupid tourists taking a thousand selfies and getting in your way. Beautifully arranged and fun to walk around spotting tiles from your own country :)",
          "Its beautiful. The way it is build, such diversity. You have to take the stairs :p la vie en rose is my favourite tile :p",
          "We was taking a good tour around Rio so as to understand more about Brazilian life and love of food and drink, and part of this walking food tour was to go past the Selar\u00f3n stairs, where we stopped for around 45-60 minutes. We had the story explained and had plenty of time to",
          "this is only an ok thing to do for me, some cool history especially if you have a guide, if you go early in the day you will get much better pictures.",
          "This amazing work throught the stairs of Santa Tereza neighborhood in Lepe, Rio de Janeiro, makes you wonder how much work and dedication was put into it. A good place to visit if you are in Rio and of course, take lots of pictures.",
          "This hidden gem in the Lapa neighbourhood in Rio is amazing!! Best to go early in the morning before the crowds. See if you can find a ceramic tile from your country!! A must see!!",
          "I arrived around 11am on a Saturday and it was so busy. However, if you go higher up the steps you can still get photos with only you! Lots of places to get a cold drink nearby. Lots of security too so felt safe",
          "When you come early it is not crowded with tourists yet. Otherwise People are queuing before the steps to make a picture. To avoid your picture being Photo-bombed visit here before 9:30am",
          "Finally had the opportunity to see the steps and the story behind it. Crowded as expected since it is a tourist attraction. The surrounding neighborhood is a little sketchy so I wouldn't wander down alleyways off of the main street that it is on.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. The steps are beautiful and it's made better knowing that the tiles come from all over the world. Perfect for your posed insta-pics, but generally just stunning anyway. Keep an eye on your belongings because tourists get targeted, and don't go to the",
          "Salerno steps is an artists dream. Tiles from all over the world come together in an amazing display of artistic beauty. There is a buzz at this location as people from all over the world congregate to walk the steps and take photos. Be careful with your possessions here as it's",
          "One the great sights of Rio, the steps are made of tiles from all over the world. It is a riot of colour, and of life, with lots of tourists hanging out, and lots of locals selling drinks and various crafts and souvenirs",
          "Very nice place in a \u00ab different \u00bb zone. A lot of tourists, but also local people. One of the most special places in Rio",
          "Impressive even more when you learn the history of it. Great place in the dodgy place in the city. Must do! definitely!",
          "A visit to the Selaron Tours is definitely on the shortlist of most travel agents and tourists. As a result the place can be very crowded (mind your wallets !) and it is difficult to make good photos here.",
          "Also known as the 'Selaron Steps'. Running from Joaquim Silva street in Lapa and Pinto Martins street in the neighborhood of Santa Teresa. It's a 5 min walk to the Lapa Arches( The Carioca Aqueduct). We got the metro and stopped on cinel\u00e2ndia station and took a 10 min walk till",
          "The Selaron steps are unique and stem from a very simple idea of tiling the risers on a long steep street with all kind of ceramic tiles. It is strangely fascinating however and great fun to climb the hill and even have photos taken sitting on the tiled ledges created on the",
          "We were quite concern about safety before going but it was busy with tourists and police, we felt safe (went there on Saturday afternoon). We even walked all the way to the top of the stairs (but didn't venture out) and we didn't feel unsafe. This is a good and fun place to",
          "We walked here after getting off the metro at Gloria. It was a wet Saturday but still very busy on the steps. Everyone was taking photos and we didn\u2019t encounter any problems with using cameras or phones. It was interesting to see all the mosaics and tiles from many different",

          "This is a beautiful place and the surroundings are safe around the stairs there were police guardsmen when i went and there are some restaurants and street vendors in the alley that leads to the stairs also the area around is walking distance from the arches. The streets nearby",
          "My husband and I did this on a tour, it was captivating. Read up on the Chilean-born artist Jorge Selaron it\u2019s a great read, it was his tribute to the Brazilian people. We walked right to the top, half way up is a house on the left, who does your photo on a tile well worth it",
          "The steps have been done by Escadaria who lost his pregnant wife in a car accident and he dedicated this work for most of the steps have a pregnant woman on the steps. Snoopy Dog did a video shoot on these steps that made it famous. It is not being maintained which is the draw",
          "Such a beautiful place. We went there right after the Museum of Tomorrow, and walked around the neighbourhood for a good hour. The place is full of tourists and has great places to take photos. while you are there don\u2019t forget to grab a caipirinha and buy a souvenir. Highly",

          "On the edge of one of the many poor quarters in Rio suddenly you are overwhelmed by colors. The famous stairs of Selar\u00f3n truly lightens up. Climb the stairs and see if you can find tiles from your own country. I found danish ones. A really feel-good experience.",
          "Not the biggest attraction in Rio but worth visiting it. The challenge is to find your country, or even your state, or why not, your city. You can be surprise. This is a good place to take color-full selfie !",
          "It was okay. At the end of the day it's an alley and stairs with lots of tiles. It's a great idea. Famous so have to take the obligatory photo. Plan the day and go early to avoid the crowds. You can get better photos with no people the higher you go. You can walk from",
          "This was an amazing sight. A little off the beaten track but easily found once you ask for it's location. All done by 1 man who sadly died in 2013 but wow what an achievement. Go to the top and look at everything. Tiles from around the world make up what is now a finished",
          "Bigger than expected, great for photos. Excellent all around. After the stairs we walked to the bar area nearby to grab a couple of drinks and bites!",

          "This is something you should not miss whilst in Rio. Amount of hard work and attention to details is indescribable. It definitely reflects an artist\u2019s true love and passion for the art.",
          "This colorful stairways link the highland Santa Tereza and the bohemian Lapa. Tiles and bathtubs are decorated with pictures and some plants. Very good for pictures, very touristic for visiting during the daytime. Lots of bars and pubs around, the area has attracted lots of",
          "The crowd formed a line to get on the steps to take photos. I think it's an average attraction. The one in San Francisco is much better. The neighborhood seems unsafe. Around 5pm while we walked on a busy street near this place and Lapa, a man pulled a hand gun out pointing",
          "This is one of those places that you could miss so easily it's not funny. I talked to someone from Rio on things to see and he gave me quite the tour guide but missed out on this. It's a place that's been put together and maintained beautifully. The street art is gorgeous.",
          "We had a nice visit on a Sunday. Not tons of people and most were very courteous for photos, etc. amazing this was done by one man!",
          "With all the \"big\" tourist attractions in Rio it would be easy to miss this place. If you do visit try to get there early morning before the crowds, when we visited (9am) the area was quiet. The tiles/steps are fabulous with tiles from over 60 countries, we even found a few from",
          "I didn't expect so many different tiles from so many countries. We didn't expect it to be such a cool place with a great vibe. We got there late in the day after a trip around Rio. Not too many tourists so lots of time to look at all the tiles and take photos. A Rio must visit",
          "Nice colourful stairs. Street art to be seen. But be careful and do climb more than haft way. The stairs take you to a favella where you should not go.",
          "It was not too busy when we visited at midday and there were plenty of opportunities for a photo with no one in the background.",
          "I visited this in August while in Rio and even if you don't know the history of the place, it's truly a masterpiece. If you've seen the iterations and the progress, as well as heard of the insane but very poetic and artistic backstory, it makes it that much more special. I could",
          "Very cool and colorful flight of stairs which was left as a gift by Chilean-born artist Jorge Selaron, which consists of tiles, mirrors, lots of Brazilian colors, people began brining tiles from all around the world during it\u00b4s construction.",
          " This is a very place. Colorful tiles displayed on walls and steps. Alot of tiles gave countries on them. Great photo ops here",
          "Loved this place and all the colors and art. We had to take a long taxi ride from Copacabanna but worth it. It's in a semi rough part of town so o.k. to go during the day but wouldn't recommend at night. Lots of tourists there and must do for a selfie.",
          "The place breathes art & creative mood, really interesting & nice, but a bit over crowded((( i would still recommend it to visit",
          "We \u201cdiscovered\u201d this place almost accidentally. It was worth every minute spent there. The stairs look very impressive with tiles donated from all over the world. We\u2019ve never seen anything like this anywhere in the world. Highly recommended!",
          "The place would have been much better if Selaron would have not exagerated by using so many red tiles eveywhere. And this is only because he was a fan of Ferrari. The place is very touristic and it has tiles from all over the world. I could not find the one from Romania but",
          "A grand mosaic running up a set of steps in Lapa. For me, this is one of my favourite spots in Rio because it is unique and artsy so it makes a perfect photo opportunity. It's also a good spot to just chill and watch the world go by.",

          "We were amazed how many different tiles we saw at Escadaria Selaron, from the most unthinkable corners of the world. It is clear evidence that Chilean-born artist Jorge Selaron didn\u2019t leave anyone untouched. His commitment to his project was both admirable and touching right",

          "Lots of people told us it was just stairs! No, it's art! The stairs are nice, pretty, well done and we can imagine there was a lot of work involved. I was personally worried about the comments concerning lack of safety. We were positively surprised to see that there were",
          "Didn't get what all the fuss is about, just basic tiles made in the last decade. I think you can spend your tome better in Rio.",

          "I love art experiences and this was one to see. The stairs are unbelievably colorful with the tiles form all over the world. The area is not great so we were told to go during the day. It was definitely worth it.",
          "First of all, you have to be aware that in this part of the city you have to be very careful, so my recommendation if you can is to take a tour, to see escadaria Selaron and santa Teresa. But you also can do it by yourself. First do it in the morning or midday, there tourist and",

          "It's a must see in Rio! Looks cool in pictures but even cooler in person and it's much bigger than I imagined. It's not the type of place you gonna spend tons of time in, so it's a good idea to stop by on the way to the Christ statue instead of taking a separate trip. If you",
          "Very original and pretty. It was actually larger than i expected and really colourful. It isn't ruined by tons of street vendors either but you will have to navigate through tons of people more preoccupied with selfies than just enjoying the moment. Also the neighbourhood at the",
          "Worth visiting if its first time there; there are just a stairs with so colorful mosaic designs: going through it and take a selfie...that's it!!. Not recommended going there by night because it's not the same colorful explosion plus insecurity.",
          "Must see this iconic staircase. Learn the story behind tiler, wonderful. It will make your exploration of the steps much more meaningful. The area is surrounded by arts, crafts and musicians. A mellow vibe but be alert because of the notoriety of the area.",
          "This is a really cool tourist attraction with an interesting story about the artist. He incorporated tiles from many different countries or cities when meeting tourists from those places. Lots of people all the time so be prepared. Really pretty site but not in the best",

          "This is a staircase with a lot of colourful tiles representing cities, countries, ... Make time to have a look at all the different ones, you will be pleasantly surprised by how many there are. It can get very busy, which will kind of ruin your pictures of the stairs. For me,",
          "There are tiles from all around the world. Situated near the historic center, the Lapa Arches and the Theatro Municipal, half hour here is highly recommended",
          "Quaint attraction that is very crowded but worth a visit if you have time. We walked here from the Carioca Aqueduct. The area seems quite dodgy, but you'll be fine if you stick to where the crowds are.",
          "I visited this on my tour with Rio by Bike. It's so impressive how much work went into this, and the final product is beautiful. There are a lot of people taking pictures, but it's not disruptive. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "Go and inspect the tiles of the staircase. Tiles from literally everywhere in the world. We even saw some from our home town. A few small street stalls and restaurants nearby. We walked the stairs all the way to santa teresa. I'd recommend this as it's very pretty and much",

          "Interesting place. In Santa Teresa neighborhood, you can walk around Santa Teresa while going to the Stairs. Avoid dark hours. It is not safe.",
          "The stairs became an attraction due to its uniqueness. It's a nice place to climb up and down and take e picture. It's quite colorful, but it seems people have not yet thought about a way to make tourists stay longer and enjoy the place more... As the carioca is very creative, I",
          "A vibrant overload of colour. Steps as far as the eye can see, all different but in tune with each other. Fabulous story behind this. See if you can find a tile from your country",
          "Great place to visit and enjoy street art. Read about the story of the escadaria first. The area in which it is located is also very pintoresque. The visit to the escadaria in itself take less half an hour but do walk the streets of Lapa and Santa Teresa",
          "The colours and art work is worth having a look at. Whilst we walked to the Escadaria Selaron pretty safely, it does pass some alley ways that give an uneasy vibe. I'd recommend going but with a tour group.",

          "I have never heard of this attraction nor was it on our private tour's itinerary, but it was cool to visit! It wasn't overly crowded while we were there and good photo ops are available. THE STAR: The steps got its name from Jorge Selar\u00f3n (1947-2013), a Chilean painter who",

          "The stairway is really cool and very colorful. It gets full of tourists though so it might be hard to get a nice picture. At night, it doesn't have a lot of lighting, so again, not great pictures. Try to climb it, because theres plenty of cool stuff on the way and its a lot",
          "Well known for its peculiar decoration and colorful stairs. A place to take pictures and see every detail. Have fun and don't forget your camera.",
          "Really very picturesque. Quaint collection of tiles from all over the world and very pleasingly arranged.",

          "Rio is indeed a city of fascination. With just a short flight of stairs, you can travel all over the world! You must come here to see the variety of tiles available. The graffiti nearby are also amazing. You see clearly the Brazilian people's desire to connect to the world.",
          "Waking is the best thing you can do in a city. This part of the city is great for just walking and in this case, walking some steps. The vibe of this city and its people is just unique. Even the way they walk is unique, they walk happily. We need to learn to walk just like they",
          "You can find beaches and mountains in many other places in the world, but not the Escadaria Selaron. Dont miss this unique experience. You need patience if you are one of those waiting for a perfect picture since the place is crowded most part of the day.",
          "Very interesting place to see that is a collection of tiles from around the world put together by one artist. The area itself is an artsy neighborhood. It seemed quite safe as long as you are aware of your belongings as with any crowded area. It can get crowded, so I",
          "It's a good idea if you spend a few days in Rio to go and visit the Santa Teresa and Lapa neighbourhoods and down the 215 steps. Even on a rainy day like today! Cool spot for pictures if not too busy, and lively area.",

Generally, feeling of safety in the centre differs a lot from Ipanema or Leblon. I\u2019d advise do not take values with you. Be also aware of huge crowds in the noon and mid-day",

          "Went during the day and it was VERY busy  recommend doing this first thing in the morningnt9 ensirenyou get a good picture",
          "To be honest is a nice place for a couple of photos but take in mind that the most iconic one will require you to do a long line (especially girls). The best for me were the local artist and the details of  the tiles. The surrounding are is not so nice or secure but within the stairs you'll always will find police.",
          "A great place to take a picture. If you want to have a perfect one, make sure to be there very early, like 6am, before all tourists. Otherwise you can take good enough one anytime, since there is a queue and people are going one by one for a picture.",
          "This artistic collection of tiles has a pretty cool story to tell. A man collected tiles from all over the world and made it into was it is today. This was his home, where he fell in love and where his heart is. \nThis place has locals \u2026",

          "An attraction, that started to live on its own. First ceramic tiles were put by an artist called Selaron, but people enjoyed it so much that they started to send them from all over the world. Now you can see this place with its unique atmosphere and take great photos.",
          "The transformation of the plain steps up to the Santa Theresa neighborhood into the tiled wonder that they are today apparently was a work of love by the artist. This is a hint of wonder in an otherwise mundane city area and is worth the effort to see the Escadaria Selar\u00f3n and to walk up and down them.",

          "It\u2019s hard to Believe the story behind these tiles is the coolest thing. I was reading the other reviews and I didn\u2019t get the same feeling that this place is unsafe. It felt pretty safe to me. I had a blast\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",

          "Such a beautiful and artistic spot. There are several murals on the walls on the walk up to the Selaron steps. It was difficult to see all the tiles on the steps as it is very busy. Definitely worth seeing though!",

          "We went with a tour but it's not even remotely required.  Uber it.  The area seems sketchy but your safe.  Give yourself an hour to really examine the tiles. So many cool ones. Pick and choose your spots as crowds come and go for pictures. \u2026",

          "The famous Rio steps, very nice place. Area they\u2019re in is a little sketchy so worth being careful. It\u2019s usually packed by the steps during the day. First day we went in the afternoon with a city walking tour and the lighting wasn\u2019t great \u2026",

          "It's a beautiful piece of art. But most of the time is crowded. I recommend to go early in the mornig, in order to avoid massive concentration of people taking pictures in the base of the stairs where the name is written. And then go up looking for the hidden mosaics, another must in Rio.",
          "Such an interesting place to have your pictures taken. My advice would be to go there as early in the morning as possible so you get to take beautiful pictures freely and as many as u want before the crowd starts coming. Go all the way up for more nice backdrops \ud83d\ude09",
          "An attraction which started to live by its own. First ceramic tiles were put by artist called Selaron but people enjoyed it so much that they started to send them from all over the world. Now you can see this place with its unique atmosphere and take great photos.",

          "We were robbed at gunpoint, in a place very close to the these stairs which is one of the most touristic attractions in Rio. After going up the stairs, we turned right to find a taxi from the square. Appearently the place was close to a \u2026",
          "Beautiful steps but lots of people when I went around 2pm on a Monday. Still very beautiful to take pictures",
          "This was a very interesting place. We spent a good bit of time walking up to the top and looking at all the unique ceramic tiles. With over 2000+ tiles it is interesting to see where some of them came from.\n\nThere is a large line at the \u2026",

We found it impossible to get to pose for a photo that wasn\u2019t crowded with tourists but perhaps arriving at a different time of day would\u2019ve helped.\n\nConsidering it\u2019s free and in a cool neighborhood I strongly recommend a visit if you are in Rio.",
          "Get the photo and get out is my advice. Apparently tourists get robbed at the top, so worth knowing. You can get the picture at the foot of the stairs anyway and there are plenty of tourists around to take it \ud83d\ude0a Santa Teresa is not a safe area to hang around in afterwards.",
          "Great, lots of people, caipiri\u00f1as for 5 reales",

It's a perfect half day activity right there :)",

        "wiki": "Rio de Janeiro (; Portuguese: [\u02c8\u0281i.u d(\u0292i) \u0292\u0250\u02c8ne(j)\u027eu] (listen);), or simply Rio, is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area and the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state, after S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\", by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Bras\u00edlia.\nRio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th largest in the world in 2008, estimated at about R$343 billion (nearly US$201 billion). It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations \u2013 Petrobras and Vale \u2013 and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data. Despite the high perception of crime, the city actually has a lower incidence of crime than most state capitals in Brazil. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the Samb\u00f3dromo (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums. Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to ever host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. The Maracan\u00e3 Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\nEuropeans first encountered Guanabara Bay on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, \"January River\"), by a Portuguese expedition under explorer Gaspar de Lemos, captain of a ship in Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's fleet, or under Gon\u00e7alo Coelho. Allegedly the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci participated as observer at the invitation of King Manuel I in the same\nexpedition. The region of Rio was inhabited by the Tupi, Puri, Botocudo and Maxakal\u00ed peoples.In 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called Villegagnon Island, was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. Consequently, Villegagnon built Fort Coligny on the island when attempting to establish the France Antarctique colony.\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded by the Portuguese on 1 March 1565 and was named S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o do Rio de Janeiro, in honour of St. Sebastian, the saint who was the namesake and patron of the Portuguese then-monarch Sebasti\u00e3o. Rio de Janeiro was the name of Guanabara Bay. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and buccaneers, such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Duclerc and Ren\u00e9 Duguay-Trouin.In the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the Bandeirantes discovered gold and diamonds in the neighbouring captaincy of Minas Gerais, thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than Salvador, Bahia, much farther northeast. On 27 January 1763, the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated Lisbon nobles, fleeing from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Portuguese court and imperial capital ===\nThe kingdom's capital was transferred to the city, which, thus, became the only European capital outside of Europe. As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes. In the first decade, several educational establishments were created, such as the Military Academy, the Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the National Library of Brazil \u2013 with the largest collection in Latin America \u2013 and The Botanical Garden. The first printed newspaper in Brazil, the Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, came into circulation during this period. When Brazil was elevated to Kingdom in 1815, it became the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves until the return of the Portuguese Royal Family to Lisbon in 1821, but remained as capital of the Kingdom of Brazil.From the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of African slaves to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people. The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.When Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his new empire while the place was enriched with sugar cane agriculture in the Campos region and, especially, with the new coffee cultivation in the Para\u00edba Valley. In order to separate the province from the capital of the Empire, the city was converted, in the year of 1834, in Neutral Municipality, passing the province of Rio de Janeiro to have Niter\u00f3i as capital.\n\nAs a political centre of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century. At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing. Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was replaced by a republic.\nOn 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, with the name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a complex with varying architectural styles like Italianate, Neo-Gothic and a tower in Mansard Roof style. After the opening in 1893, workers from Great Britain arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared. In May 1894, Thomas Donohoe, a British worker from Busby, Scotland, arrived in Bangu.Donohoe was horrified to discover that there was absolutely no knowledge of football among Brazilians. So he wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to bring a football when she joined him. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. It was a five-a-side match between British workers, and took place six months before the first game organized by Charles Miller in S\u00e3o Paulo. However, the Bangu Football Club was not formally created until 1904.\n\n\n=== Republican period ===\n\nAt the time Brazil's Old Republic was established, the city lacked urban planning and sanitation, which helped spread several diseases, such as yellow fever, dysentery, variola, tuberculosis and even black death. Pereira Passos, who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the corti\u00e7os where most of the poor population lived. These people, mostly descendants of slaves, then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first favelas. Inspired by the city of Paris, Passos built the Municipal Theatre, the National Museum of Fine Arts and the National Library in the city's center; brought electric power to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to automobiles. Passos also named Dr. Oswaldo Cruz as Director General of Public Health. Cruz's plans to clean the city of diseases included compulsory vaccination of the entire population and forced entry into houses to kill mosquitos and rats. The people of city rebelled against Cruz's policy, in what would be known as the Vaccine Revolt.In 1910, Rio saw the Revolt of the Lash, where Afro-Brazilian crew members in the Brazilian Navy mutinied against the heavy use of corporal punishment, which was similar to the punishment slaves received. The mutineers took control of the battleship Minas Geraes and threatened to fire on the city. Another military revolt occurred in 1922, the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt, a march against the Old Republic's coronelism and caf\u00e9 com leite politics. This revolt marked the beginning of Tenentism, a movement that resulted in the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that started the Vargas Era.\nUntil the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighbourhood now known as the historic city centre (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighbourhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905. Botafogo's natural environment, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, the luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town. This reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade and militias.Plans for moving the nation's capital city from Rio de Janeiro to the centre of Brazil had been occasionally discussed, and when Juscelino Kubitschek was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital. Though many thought that it was just campaign rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have Bras\u00edlia and a new Federal District built, at great cost, by 1960. On 21 April of that year the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Bras\u00edlia. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, Guanabara, after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat that installed a military dictatorship, the city-state was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. Then, in 1975, a presidential decree known as \"The Fusion\" removed the city's federative status and merged it with the State of Rio de Janeiro, with the city of Rio de Janeiro replacing Niter\u00f3i as the state's capital, and establishing the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region.In 1992, Rio hosted the Earth Summit, a United Nations conference to fight environmental degradation. Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on sustainable development, named United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The city hosted the World Youth Day in 2013, the second World Youth Day in South America and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2007 Pan American Games and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final. On 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee announced that Rio de Janeiro would host the 2016 Olympic Games and the 2016 Paralympic Games, beating competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and Madrid. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after Mexico City in 1968) to host the Games.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nRio de Janeiro is on the far western part of a strip of Brazil's Atlantic coast (between a strait east to Ilha Grande, on the Costa Verde, and the Cabo Frio), close to the Tropic of Capricorn, where the shoreline is oriented east\u2013west. Facing largely south, the city was founded on an inlet of this stretch of the coast, Guanabara Bay (Ba\u00eda de Guanabara), and its entrance is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar) \u2013 a \"calling card\" of the city.The Centre (Centro), the core of Rio, lies on the plains of the western shore of Guanabara Bay. The greater portion of the city, commonly referred to as the North Zone (Zona Norte, Rio de Janeiro), extends to the northwest on plains composed of marine and continental sediments and on hills and several rocky mountains. The South Zone (Zona Sul) of the city, reaching the beaches fringing the open sea, is cut off from the Centre and from the North Zone by coastal mountains. These mountains and hills are offshoots of the Serra do Mar to the northwest, the ancient gneiss-granite mountain chain that forms the southern slopes of the Brazilian Highlands. The large West Zone (Zona Oeste), long cut off by the mountainous terrain, had been made more easily accessible to those on the South Zone by new roads and tunnels by the end of the 20th century.The population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of 1,182.3 square kilometres (456.5 sq mi), is about 6,000,000. The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11\u201313.5 million. Residents of the city are known as cariocas. The official song of Rio is \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", by composer Andr\u00e9 Filho.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National Park, the world's first urban forest and UNESCO Environmental Heritage and Biosphere Reserve; Pedra Branca State Park, which houses the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the Quinta da Boa Vista complex; the Botanical Garden; Rio's Zoo; Parque Lage; and the Passeio P\u00fablico, the first public park in the Americas. In addition the Flamengo Park is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much vegetation.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nDue to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region, the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The Guanabara Bay has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the World Health Organization, in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.The waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29 million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers. With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high concentrations of heavy metals \u2013 mainly zinc and cadmium \u2013 have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of Santa Cruz, Itagua\u00ed and Nova Igua\u00e7u, constructed under the supervision of State policies.The Marapendi lagoon and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon have suffered with the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment buildings close by. The illegal discharge of sewage and the consequent deaths of algae diminished the oxygenation of the waters, causing fish mortality.There are, on the other hand, signs of decontamination in the lagoon made through a public-private partnership established in 2008 to ensure that the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing. The decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nRio has a tropical savanna climate (Aw) that closely borders a tropical monsoon climate (Am) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between December and March. The city experiences hot, humid summers, and warm, sunny winters. In inland areas of the city, temperatures above 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) can occur on a monthly basis.\nAlong the coast, the breeze, blowing onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from Antarctica, especially during autumn and winter, causing frequent weather changes. In summer there can be strong rains, which have, on some occasions, provoked catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic. The city has had rare frosts in the past. Some areas within Rio de Janeiro state occasionally have falls of snow grains and ice pellets (popularly called granizo) and hail. Drought is very rare, albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city's strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014\u20132015, most severe in the Southeast Region and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the Para\u00edba do Sul River to the Guandu River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Para\u00edba do Sul to the Sistema Cantareira (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken Greater S\u00e3o Paulo area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.Roughly in the same suburbs (Nova Igua\u00e7u and surrounding areas, including parts of Campo Grande and Bangu) that correspond to the location of the March 2012, February\u2013March 2013 and January 2015 pseudo-hail (granizo) falls, there was a tornado-like phenomenon in January 2011, for the first time in the region's recorded history, causing structural damage and long-lasting blackouts, but no fatalities. The World Meteorological Organization has advised that Brazil, especially its southeastern region, must be prepared for increasingly severe weather occurrences in the near future, since events such as the catastrophic January 2011 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides are not an isolated phenomenon. In early May 2013, winds registering above 90 km/h (56 mph) caused blackouts in 15 neighborhoods of the city and three surrounding municipalities, and killed one person. Rio saw similarly high winds (about 100 km/h (62 mph)) in January 2015. The average annual minimum temperature is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F), the average annual maximum temperature is 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F), and the average annual temperature is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). The average yearly precipitation is 1,069 mm (42.1 in).\n\nTemperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. During the winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (in the form of winds from the Amazon Forest), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an extratropical cyclone) and summer evapotranspiration bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns. As a result, temperatures over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), that may happen about year-round but are much more common during the summer, often mean the actual temperature feeling is over 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F), when there is little wind and the relative humidity percentage is high.Rio de Janeiro is second only to Cuiab\u00e1 as the hottest Brazilian state capital outside Northern and Northeastern Brazil; temperatures below 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) occur yearly, while those lower than 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) happen less often. The phrase, fazer frio (\"making cold\", i.e. \"the weather is getting cold\"), usually refers to temperatures going below 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F), which is possible year-round and is commonplace in mid-to-late autumn, winter and early spring nights.\nBetween 1961 and 1990, at the INMET (Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology) conventional station in the neighborhood of Sa\u00fade, the lowest temperature recorded was 10.1 \u00b0C (50.2 \u00b0F) in October 1977, and the highest temperature recorded was 39 \u00b0C (102.2 \u00b0F) in December 1963. The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 167.4 mm (6.6 in) in January 1962. However, the absolute minimum temperature ever recorded at the INMET Jacarepagu\u00e1 station was 3.8 \u00b0C (38.8 \u00b0F) in July 1974, while the absolute maximum was 43.2 \u00b0C (110 \u00b0F) on 26 December 2012 in the neighborhood of the Santa Cruz station. The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours, 186.2 mm (7.3 in), was recorded at the Santa Teresa station in April 1967. The lowest temperature ever registered in the 21st century was 8.1 \u00b0C (46.6 \u00b0F) in Vila Militar, July 2011.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\n\nThe city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them Santa Cruz, Campo Grande and the wealthy newer Barra da Tijuca district.\n\n\n=== Central Zone ===\n\nCentro or Downtown is the historic core of the city, as well as its financial centre. Sites of interest include the Pa\u00e7o Imperial, built during colonial times to serve as a residence for the Portuguese governors of Brazil; many historic churches, such as the Candel\u00e1ria Church (the former cathedral), S\u00e3o Jose, Santa Lucia, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Santa Rita, S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula, and the monasteries of Santo Ant\u00f4nio and S\u00e3o Bento. The Centro also houses the modern concrete Rio de Janeiro Cathedral.  Around the Cinel\u00e2ndia square, there are several landmarks of the Belle \u00c9poque of Rio, such as the Municipal Theatre and the National Library building.\nAmong its several museums, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes (National Museum of Fine Arts) and the Museu Hist\u00f3rico Nacional (National Historical Museum) are the most important. Other important historical attractions in central Rio include its Passeio P\u00fablico, an 18th-century public garden. Major streets include Avenida Rio Branco and Avenida Vargas, both constructed, in 1906 and 1942 respectively, by destroying large swaths of the colonial city. A number of colonial streets, such as Rua do Ouvidor and Uruguaiana, have long been pedestrian spaces, and the popular Saara shopping district has been pedestrianized more recently. Also located in the center is the traditional neighbourhood called Lapa, an important bohemian area frequented by both townspeople and tourists.\n\n\n=== South Zone ===\n\nThe South Zone of Rio de Janeiro (Zona Sul) is composed of several districts, among which are S\u00e3o Conrado, Leblon, Ipanema, Arpoador, Copacabana, and Leme, which compose Rio's famous Atlantic beach coastline. Other districts in the South Zone are Gl\u00f3ria, Catete, Flamengo, Botafogo, and Urca, which border Guanabara Bay, and Santa Teresa, Cosme Velho, Laranjeiras, Humait\u00e1, Lagoa, Jardim Bot\u00e2nico, and G\u00e1vea. It is the wealthiest part of the city and the best known overseas; the neighborhoods of Leblon and Ipanema, in particular, have the most expensive real estate in all of South America.\nThe neighbourhood of Copacabana beach hosts one of the world's most spectacular New Year's Eve parties (\"Reveillon\"), as more than two million revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the fireworks display. From 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event.To the north of Leme, and at the entrance to Guanabara Bay, is the district of Urca and the Sugarloaf Mountain ('P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar'), whose name describes the famous mountain rising out of the sea. The summit can be reached via a two-stage cable car trip from Praia Vermelha, with the intermediate stop on Morro da Urca. It offers views of the city second only to Corcovado mountain. Hang gliding is a popular activity on the Pedra Bonita (literally, \"Beautiful Rock\"). After a short flight, gliders land on the Praia do Pepino (Pepino, or \"cucumber\", Beach) in S\u00e3o Conrado.\nSince 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded urban forest and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio (Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro or PUC-Rio), Brazil's top private university, is located at the edge of the forest, in the G\u00e1vea district. The 1984 film Blame It on Rio was filmed nearby, with the rental house used by the story's characters sitting at the edge of the forest on a mountain overlooking the famous beaches. In 2012, CNN elected Ipanema the best city beach in the world.\n\n\n=== North Zone ===\n\nThe North Zone (Zona Norte) begins at Grande Tijuca (the middle class residential and commercial bairro of Tijuca), just west of the city center, and sprawls for miles inland until Baixada Fluminense and the city's Northwest.\nThis region is home to the Maracan\u00e3 stadium (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest capacity football venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as it did for the World Cup final of 1950. More recently its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000; it will eventually hold around 80,000 people. Maracan\u00e3 was the site for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football competition of the 2007 Pan American Games; hosted the final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the football matches of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nBesides Maracan\u00e3, the North Zone of Rio also has other tourist and historical attractions, such \"Nossa Senhora da Penha de Fran\u00e7a Church\", the Christ the Redeemer (statue) with its stairway built into the rock bed, 'Manguinhos', the home of Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, a centenarian biomedical research institution with a main building fashioned like a Moorish palace, and the Quinta da Boa Vista, the park where the historic Imperial Palace is located. Nowadays, the palace hosts the National Museum, specialising in Natural History, Archaeology, and Ethnology. The International Airport of Rio de Janeiro (Gale\u00e3o \u2013 Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport, named after the famous Brazilian musician Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim), the main campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro at the Fund\u00e3o Island, and the State University of Rio de Janeiro, in Maracan\u00e3, are also located in the Northern part of Rio.\nThis region is also home to most of the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Imp\u00e9rio Serrano, Unidos da Tijuca, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, among others. Some of the main neighbourhoods of Rio's North Zone are Alto da Boa Vista which shares the Tijuca Rainforest with the South and Southwest Zones; Tijuca, Vila Isabel, M\u00e9ier, S\u00e3o Cristov\u00e3o, Madureira, Penha, Manguinhos, Fund\u00e3o, Olaria among others. Many of Rio de Janeiro's roughly 1000 slums, or favelas, are located in the North Zone.  The favelas resemble the slums of Paris, New York or other major cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States and Europe, or similar neighborhoods in present underdeveloped countries.\n\n\n=== West Zone ===\n\nWest Zone (Zona Oeste) of Rio de Janeiro is a vaguely defined area that covers some 50% of the city's entire area, including Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhoods. The West Side of Rio has many historic sites because of the old \"Royal Road of Santa Cruz\" that crossed the territory in the regions of Realengo, Bangu, and Campo Grande, finishing at the Royal Palace of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz region. The highest peak of the city of Rio de Janeiro is the Pedra Branca Peak (Pico da Pedra Branca) inside the Pedra Branca State Park. It has an altitude of 1024m. The Pedra Branca State Park (Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca) is the biggest urban state park in the world comprising 17 neighborhoods in the west side, being a \"giant lung\" in the city with trails, waterfalls and historic constructions like an old aqueduct in the Col\u00f4nia Juliano Moreira in the neighborhood of Taquara and a dam in Camorim. The park has three principal entrances: the main one is in Taquara called Pau da Fome Core, another entrance is the Piraquara Core in Realengo and the last one is the Camorim Core, considered the cultural heritage of the city.\nSanta Cruz and Campo Grande Region have exhibited economic growth, mainly in the Campo Grande neighborhood. Industrial enterprises are being built in lower and lower middle class residential Santa Cruz, one of the largest and most populous of Rio de Janeiro's neighbourhoods, most notably Ternium Brasil, a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, which is planned to be South America's largest steel works. A tunnel called T\u00fanel da Grota Funda, opened in 2012, creating a public transit facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz, lessening travel time to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Barra da Tijuca region ===\n\nThis is an elite area of the West Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It includes Barra da Tijuca, Recreio dos Bandeirantes, Vargem Grande, Vargem Pequena, Grumari, Itanhang\u00e1, Camorim and Jo\u00e1. Westwards from the older zones of Rio, Barra da Tijuca is a flat complex of barrier islands of formerly undeveloped coastal land, which constantly experiences new constructions and developments. It remains an area of accelerated growth, attracting some of the richer sectors of the population as well as luxury companies. High rise flats and sprawling shopping centers give the area a far more modern feel than the crowded city centre.\nThe urban planning of the area, completed in the late 1960s, mixes zones of single-family houses with residential skyscrapers. The beaches of Barra da Tijuca are also popular with the residents from other parts of the city. One of the most famous hills in the city is the 842-metre-high (2,762-foot) Pedra da G\u00e1vea (Crow's nest Rock) bordering the South Zone. On the top of its summit is a huge rock formation (some, such as Erich von D\u00e4niken in his 1973 book, In Search of Ancient Gods, claim it to be a sculpture) resembling a sphinx-like, bearded head that is visible for many kilometres around.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 5,940,224 people residing in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The census revealed the following numbers: 3,239,888 White people (51.2%), 2,318,675 Pardo (multiracial) people (36.5%), 708,148 Black people (11.5%), 45,913 Asian people (0.7%), 5,981 Amerindian people (0.1%). The population of Rio de Janeiro was 53.2% female and 46.8% male.In 2010, the city of Rio de Janeiro was the 2nd most populous city in Brazil, after S\u00e3o Paulo.Different ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different indigenous peoples speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the French were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.Rio de Janeiro is home to the largest Portuguese population outside of Lisbon in Portugal. After independence from Portugal, Rio de Janeiro became a destination for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Portugal, mainly in the early 20th century. The immigrants were mostly poor peasants who subsequently found prosperity in Rio as city workers and small traders. The Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and language. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, fluminense, and other Brazilian dialects.\n\nPeople of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.\nThe black community was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from Angola and Mozambique, as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and West African descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city.\nToday, nearly half of the city's population is by phenotype perceptibly black or part black. A large majority has some recent sub-Saharan ancestor. White in Brazil is defined more by having a European-looking phenotype rather than ancestry, and two full siblings can be of different \"racial\" categories in a skin color and phenotype continuum from p\u00e1lido (branco) or fair-skinned, through branco moreno or swarthy Caucasian, mesti\u00e7o claro or lighter skinned multiracial, pardo (mixed race) to negro or black. Pardo, for example, in popular usage includes those who are caboclos (mestizos), mulatos (mulattoes), cafuzos (zambos), ju\u00e7aras (archaic term for tri-racials) and westernized Amerindians (which are called caboclos as well), being more of a skin color rather than a racial group in particular.\nAs a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area are communities of Levantine Arabs who are mostly Christian or Irreligious, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese, Jews, and people from other parts of Brazil. The main waves of internal migration came from people of African, mixed or older Portuguese (as descendants of early settlers) descent from Minas Gerais and people of Eastern European, Swiss, Italian, German, Portuguese and older Portuguese-Brazilian heritage from Esp\u00edrito Santo in the early and mid-20th century, together with people with origins in Northeastern Brazil, in the mid-to-late and late 20th century, as well some in the early 21st century (the latter more directed to peripheries than the city's core).\n\nAccording to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro, the \"pardos\" there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the \"whites\" (who thought of themselves as \"very mixed\") were found to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The \"pardos\" for example thought of themselves as \u2153 European, \u2153 African and \u2153 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European. Other studies showed similar results\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\nRio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil (after S\u00e3o Paulo) and has a rapidly expanding population and rapidly growing area due to rapid urbanization.\n\nChanging demographics the city of Rio de Janeiro\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, according to 2009 research from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas (known as Novo Mapa das Religi\u00f5es), is mostly Catholic (51.1%). Rio de Janeiro city also ranks fifth among Brazilian state capital cities in the percentage of its population that is irreligious (13.3%), barely changing since 2000 (the first-ranked, Boa Vista, has 21.2% irreligious). It is also the Brazilian state capital with the greatest percentage of Spiritists (now about 4\u20135%), and with substantial numbers in Afro-Brazilian religions and Eastern religions.\n\n\n== Social issues ==\n\nThere are significant disparities between the rich and the poor in Rio de Janeiro, and different socioeconomic groups are largely segregated into different neighborhoods. Although the city clearly ranks among the world's major metropolises, large numbers live in slums known as favelas, where 95% of the population are poor, compared to 40% in the general population.There have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to housing projects such as Cidade de Deus to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas and bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the \"Favela Bairro\" program and deployment of Pacifying Police Units.\nRio has more people living in slums than any other city in Brazil, according to the 2010 Census. More than 1,500,000 people live in its 763 favelas, 22% of Rio's total population. S\u00e3o Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, has more favelas (1,020) in sheer numbers, but proportionally has fewer people living in favelas than Rio.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nRio de Janeiro has the second largest GDP of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by S\u00e3o Paulo. According to the IBGE, it was approximately US$201 billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban metropolis (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.Greater Rio de Janeiro, as perceived by the IBGE, has a GDP of US$187 billion, constituting the second largest hub of national wealth. Per capita GDP is US$11,786. It concentrates 68% of the state's economic strength and 7.9% of all goods and services produced in the country. The services sector comprises the largest portion of GDP (65.5%), followed by commerce (23.4%), industrial activities (11.1%) and agriculture (0.1%).Benefiting from the federal capital position it had for a long period (1763\u20131960), the city became a dynamic administrative, financial, commercial and cultural center. Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. The city was chosen as headquarters for state-owned companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, National Economic and Social Development Bank and Vale (which was privatized in the 1990s). The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845. Despite the transfer of the capital to Bras\u00edlia in 1960, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area.\nThe off-shore oil exploration in the Campos Basin began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of Shell, EBX and Esso. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil, with oil refineries, shipbuilding industries, steel, metallurgy, petrochemicals, cement, pharmaceutical, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.\n\nMajor international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: Merck, Roche, Arrow, Darrow, Baxter, Mayne, and Mappel. A newer electronics and computer sector has been added to the more-established industries. Construction, also an important activity, provides a significant source of employment for large numbers of unskilled workers and is buoyed by the number of seasonal residents who build second homes in the Greater Rio de Janeiro area.\nRio is an important financial centre, second only to S\u00e3o Paulo in volume of business. Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to S\u00e3o Paulo, is still of major importance. Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses. The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as Intelig, Oi and Embratel. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: Jornal do Brasil, O Dia, and Business Rio.\nTourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life. The city is the nation's top tourist attraction for both Brazilians and foreigners.To attract industry, the state government has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.Owing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the Centre, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centres, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.Rio de Janeiro is (as of 2014) the second largest exporting municipality in Brazil.  Annually, Rio exported a total of $7.49B (USD) worth of goods.  The top three goods exported by the municipality were crude petroleum (40%), semi finished iron product (16%), and semi finished steel products (11%).  Material categories of mineral products (42%) and metals (29%) make up 71% of all exports from Rio.Compared to other cities, Rio de Janeiro's economy is the 2nd largest in Brazil, behind S\u00e3o Paulo, and the 30th largest in the world with a GDP of R$ 201,9 billion in 2010. The per capita income for the city was R$22,903 in 2007 (around US$14,630). Largely because of the strength of Brazil's currency at the time, Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, reported that Rio de Janeiro ranked 12th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2011, up from the 29th position in 2010, just behind S\u00e3o Paulo (ranked 10th), and ahead of London, Paris, Milan, and New York City. Rio also had the most expensive hotel rates in Brazil, and the daily rate of its five star hotels were the second most expensive in the world after only New York City.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nRio de Janeiro is Brazil's primary tourist attraction and resort. It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82 million international tourists a year.The city boasts world-class hotels, like Belmond Copacabana Palace, approximately 80 kilometres of beaches and the famous Corcovado, Sugarloaf mountains and Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.The fact that Bras\u00edlia replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that S\u00e3o Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.Rio de Janeiro's government has since undertaken to modernise the city's economy, reduce its chronic social inequalities, and improve its commercial standing as part of an initiative for the regeneration of the tourism industry.The city is an important global LGBT destination, 1 million LGBT tourists visiting each year. The Rua Farme de Amoedo is located in Ipanema, a famous neighborhood in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The street and the nearby beach, famous tourist spots, are remarkable for their popularity in the LGBT community. Rio de Janeiro is the most awarded destination by World Travel Awards in the South American category of \"best destination\".\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Portuguese language is the official and national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum. There are also international schools, such as the American School of Rio de Janeiro, Our Lady of Mercy School, the Corcovado German School, the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais and the British School of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Educational institutions ===\n\nThe city has several universities and research institutes. The Ministry of Education has certified approximately 99 upper-learning institutions in Rio.The most prestigious university is the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. It is the fifth best in Latin America; the second best in Brazil, second only to the University of S\u00e3o Paulo; and the best in Latin America, according to the QS World University Rankings.Some notable higher education institutions are Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ); Federal University of the Rio de Janeiro state (UNIRIO); Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ); Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ, often nicknamed Rural); Fluminense Federal University (UFF); Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio); Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation (FGV); Military Institute of Engineering (IME); Superior Institute of Technology in Computer Science of Rio de Janeiro (IST-Rio); College of Publicity and Marketing (ESPM); National Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA); Superior institute of Education of Rio de Janeiro (ISERJ) and Federal Center of Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ). There are more than 137 upper-learning institutions in whole Rio de Janeiro state.\n\n\n=== Educational system ===\nPrimary schools are largely under municipal administration, while the state plays a more significant role in the extensive network of secondary schools. There are also a small number of schools under federal administration, as is the case of Pedro II School, Col\u00e9gio de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da UFRJ and the Centro Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET-RJ). In addition, Rio has an ample offering of private schools that provide education at all levels. Rio is home to many colleges and universities.  The literacy rate for cariocas aged 10 and older is nearly 95 percent, well above the national average.The Rio de Janeiro State University (public), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (public), Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets (private) and Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (private) are among the country's top institutions of higher education.  Other institutes of higher learning include the Col\u00e9gio Regina Coeli in Usina, notable for having its own 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge funicular railway on its grounds.In Rio, there were 1,033 primary schools with 25,594 teachers and 667,788 students in 1995. There are 370 secondary schools with 9,699 teachers and 227,892 students. There are 53 University-preparatory schools with 14,864 teachers and 154,447 students. The city has six major universities and 47 private schools of higher learning.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nRio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the Portuguese Imperial family and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by Portuguese, English, and French architecture.Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival has been held annually since 1999.Rio currently brings together the main production centers of Brazilian television. Major international films set in Rio de Janeiro include Blame it on Rio; the James Bond film Moonraker; the Oscar award-winning, critically acclaimed Central Station by Walter Salles, who is also one of Brazil's best-known directors; and the Oscar award-winning historical drama, Black Orpheus, which depicted the early days of Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. Internationally famous, Brazilian-made movies illustrating a darker side of Rio de Janeiro include Elite Squad and City of God.\n\nRio has many important cultural landmarks, such as the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library), one of the largest libraries in the world with collections totalling more than 9 million items; the Theatro Municipal; the National Museum of Fine Arts; the Carmen Miranda Museum; the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden; the Parque Lage; the Quinta da Boa Vista; the Imperial Square; the Brazilian Academy of Letters; the Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro; and the Natural History Museum.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nAfter Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a European-style bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. Joaquim Manuel de Macedo's A Moreninha (1844) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune.\n\nThe first notable work of realism focusing on the urban lower-middle class is Manuel Ant\u00f4nio de Almeida's Mem\u00f3rias de um sargento de mil\u00edcias (1854), which presents a series of picaresque but touching scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.The most famous author of Rio de Janeiro, however, was Machado de Assis, who is also widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literature and considered the founder of Realism in Brazil, with the publication of The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (1881). He commented on and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from Empire to Republic with his numerous chronicles published in newspapers of the time. Many of his short stories and novels, like Quincas Borba (1891) and Dom Casmurro (1899), are placed in Rio.\nThe headquarters of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is based in Rio de Janeiro. It was satirized by the novelist Jorge Amado in Pen, Sword, Camisole. Amado, himself, went on to be one of the 40 members of the Academy.\n\n\n==== Libraries ====\n\nThe Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America. Located in Cinel\u00e2ndia, the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the History of Portugal and Brazil; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Ant\u00f4nio de Ara\u00fajo de Azevedo, the \"Count of Barca\", including the 125-volume set of prints \"Le Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Univers;\" a collection of documents regarding the Jesu\u00edtica Province of Paraguay and the \"Region of Prata;\" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by Emperor Pedro II. The collection contains 48,236 items. Individual items of special interest include a rare first edition of Os Lus\u00edadas by Luis de Cam\u00f5es, published in 1584; two copies of the Mog\u00fancia Bible; and a first edition of Handel's Messiah.The Real Gabinete Portugu\u00eas de Leitura (Portuguese Royal Reading Library) is located at Rua Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, in the Centro (Downtown). The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three Portuguese immigrants, political refugees, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire. The history of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is linked to the Real Gabinete, since some of the early meetings of the Academy were held there.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe official song of Rio de Janeiro is \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", which means \"marvelous city\". The song is considered the civic anthem of Rio, and is always the favourite song during Rio's Carnival in February. Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, are considered the centre of the urban music movement in Brazil.\"Rio was popularised by the hit song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", composed by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes and recorded by Astrud Gilberto and Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. It is also the main key song of the bossa nova, a music genre born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is Funk Carioca. While samba music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of electronic music associated with the current US black music scene, including hip hop, modern soul, and house music.\"Brazil's return to democracy in 1985 after over 20 years of military authoritarian rule, and the subsequent end of rampant censorship, allowed for a new freedom of expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture. Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the Punk in Brazil, and that of Brazilian thrash metal. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nRio de Janeiro's Theatro Municipal is one of the most attractive buildings in the central area of the city. Home of one of the largest stages in Latin America and one of Brazil's best known venues for opera, ballet, and classical music, the building was inspired by the Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera. Construction of the Theatro Municipal began in 1905 following designs of the architect Francisco Pereira Passos. The statues on the top, of two women representing Poetry and Music, are by Rodolfo Bernardelli, and the interior is rich with furnishings and fine paintings. Inaugurated in 1909, the Teatro Municipal has close to 1,700 seats. Its interior includes turn of the century stained glass from France, ceilings of rose-colored marble and a 1,000 pound crystal bead chandelier surrounded by a painting of the \"Dance of the Hours\". The exterior walls of the building are dotted with inscriptions bearing the names of famous Brazilians as well as many other international celebrities.Cidade das Artes (City of Arts) is a cultural complex in Barra da Tijuca in the Southwest Zone of Rio de Janeiro, which was originally planned to open in 2004. Formally known as \"Cidade da M\u00fasica\" (City of Music), it was finally inaugurated at the beginning of 2013.\nThe project will host the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra becoming a main center for music as will be the largest modern concert hall in South America, with 1,780 seats. The complex spans approximately 90 thousand square metres (1 million square feet) and also features a chamber music hall, three theaters, and 12 rehearsal rooms. From the terrace there is a panoramic view of the zone. The building was designed by the French architect Christian de Portzamparc and construction was funded by the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\n\n==== New Year's Eve ====\n\nEvery 31 December, 2.5 million people gather at Copacabana Beach to celebrate New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all night at the hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second largest celebration only next to the Carnival. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the champagne bottle and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds to the spirit of the festivities.\n\n\n==== Rock in Rio ====\n\n\"Rock in Rio\" is a music festival conceived by entrepreneur Roberto Medina for the first time in 1985, and since its creation, recognized as the largest music festival in the Latin world and the largest in the world, with 1.5 million people attending the first event, 700,000 attending the second and fourth, about 1.2 million attending the third, and about 350,000 people attending each of the 3 Lisbon events. It was originally organized in Rio de Janeiro, from where the name comes from, has become a world level event and, in 2004, had its first edition abroad in Lisbon, Portugal, before Madrid, Spain and Las Vegas, United States. The festival is considered the eighth best in the world by the specialized site Fling Festival.\n\n\n==== Carnival ====\n\nCarnaval, is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40 days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had Bourbon and Austrian ancestors. Up until the time of the marchinhas, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music became more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the famous samba school (Escolas de Samba) parades in the sambadrome exhibition center and the popular blocos de carnaval, street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city. The most famous ones are:\n\nCord\u00e3o do Bola Preta: Parades in the centre of the city. It is one of the most traditional carnavals. In 2008, 500,000 people attended in one day. In 2011, a record 2 million people attended the city covering three different metro stations.\nSuvaco do Cristo: Band that parades in the Botanic Garden, directly below the Redeemer statue's arm. The name translates to 'Christ's armpit' in English, and was chosen for that reason.\nCarmelitas: Band that was supposedly created by nuns, but in fact is just a theme chosen by the band. It parades in Santa Teresa, a bairro from where one can see extensive panoramas.\nSimpatia \u00e9 Quase Amor: One of the most popular parades in Ipanema. Translates as 'Friendliness is almost love'.\nBanda de Ipanema: The most traditional in Ipanema. It attracts a wide range of revellers, including families and a wide spectrum of the LGBT/Queer population (notably drag queens).In 1840, the first Carnaval was celebrated with a masked ball. As years passed, adorned floats and costumed revelers became a tradition among the celebrants. Carnaval is known as a historic root of Brazilian music.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \n\nAs in the rest of Brazil, association football is the most popular sport. The city's major teams are Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Fluminense and Botafogo. Madureira, Bangu, Portuguesa, America and Bonsucesso are small clubs. Famous players born in the city include Ronaldo and Rom\u00e1rio.Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team's matches. The Maracan\u00e3 was also the location of the infamous tournament-deciding match between Uruguay and Brazil, where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2\u20131 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracan\u00e3 hosted seven matches, including the final, where Germany beat Argentina 1\u20130.\n\n\n=== Olympics ===\n\nOn 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee selected Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Olympics. Rio made their first bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics, but lost to Berlin. They later made bids for the 2004 and 2012 Games, but failed to become a candidate city both times. Those games were awarded to Athens and London respectively.Rio is the first Brazilian and South American city to host the Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro also became the first city in the southern hemisphere outside of Australia to host the games \u2013 Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. In July 2007, Rio successfully organized and hosted the XV Pan American Games.\nRio de Janeiro also hosted the 2011 Military World Games from 15\u201324 July 2011. The 2011 Military World Games were the largest military sports event ever held in Brazil, with approximately 4,900 athletes from 108 countries competing in 20 sports.Rio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics. The Olympic Games were held from 5 to 21 August 2016. The Paralympics were held from 7 to 18 September 2016.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nThe city has a history as host of major international sports events. The Gin\u00e1sio do Maracan\u00e3zinho was the host arena for the official FIBA Basketball World Championship for its 1954 and 1963 editions. Later, the Jacarepagu\u00e1 circuit in Rio de Janeiro was the site for the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix from 1978 to 1989. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the MotoGP Brazilian Grand Prix from 1995 to 2004 and the Champ Car event from 1996 to 1999. WCT/WQS surfing championships were contested on the beaches from 1985 to 2001. The Rio Champions Cup Tennis tournament is held in the spring. As part of its preparations to host the 2007 Pan American Games, Rio built a new stadium, Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange, to hold 45,000 people. It was named after Brazilian ex-FIFA president Jo\u00e3o Havelange. The stadium is owned by the city of Rio de Janeiro, but it was rented to Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas for 20 years. Rio de Janeiro has also a multi-purpose arena, the HSBC Arena.\n\nThe Brazilian Dance/Sport/Martial art Capoeira is very popular. Other popular sports are basketball, beach football, beach volleyball, Beach American Football, footvolley, surfing, kite surfing, hang gliding, motor racing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, sailing, and competitive rowing. Another sport that is highly popular in beaches of Rio is called \"Frescobol\" (pronounced [f\u027ee\u031e\u0255ko\u031e\u02c8b\u0254w]), a type of beach tennis. Rio de Janeiro is also paradise for rock climbers, with hundreds of routes all over the city, ranging from easy boulders to highly technical big wall climbs, all inside the city. The most famous, Rio's granite mountain, the Sugar Loaf (P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar), is an example, with routes from the easy third grade (American 5.4, French 3) to the extremely difficult ninth grade (5.13/8b), up to 280 metres (919 feet).\nHorse racing events are held Thursday nights and weekend afternoons at Hip\u00f3dromo da G\u00e1vea. An impressive place with excellent grass and dirt tracks, it runs the best horses in the nation. Hang gliding in Rio de Janeiro started in the mid-1970s and quickly proved to be well-suited for this town, because of its geography: steep mountains encounter the Atlantic Ocean, which provide excellent take-off locations and great landing zones on the beach.\nOne of the most popular sea sports in the city is yachting. The main yacht clubs are in Botafogo area that extends halfway between Copacabana and the center of town. Though the most exclusive and interesting is probably the Rio Yacht club, where high society makes it a point to congregate. Most yacht clubs are open to members only and gate crashing is not easy. Copacabana is also a great place to surf, as well as \"Arpoador of Ipanema\" beach and \"Praia dos Bandeirantes\". The sea at these beaches is rough and dangerous, and the best surfers from Brazil and other sites of the world come to these beaches to prove themselves.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro is served by the following airports for use:\n\nGale\u00e3o\u2013Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport: used for all international and most of the domestic flights. Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to the city. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Gale\u00e3o has connections to 19 countries. It has a capacity to handle up to 30 million users a year in two passenger terminals. It is located 20 km (12 mi) from downtown Rio. The airport complex also has Brazil's longest runway at 4,000 m (13,123.36 ft), and one of South America's largest cargo logistics terminals. The airport is connected to the express bus service.\nSantos Dumont Airport: used mainly by the services to S\u00e3o Paulo, some short and medium-haul domestic flights, and general aviation. Located on Guanabara Bay just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Rio, during the 1990s Santos-Dumont began to outgrow its capacity, besides diverging from its specialization on short-hop flights, offering routes to other destinations in Brazil. For this reason, in late 2004 Santos-Dumont returned to its original condition of operating only shuttle flights to and from Congonhas Airport in S\u00e3o Paulo, along with regional aviation. The passenger terminal has undergone extensive renovation and expansion, which increased its capacity to 9,9 million users a year. The airport is connected to the city light rail system (Rio de Janeiro Light Rail), which connects several transport systems to downtown.\nJacarepagu\u00e1-Roberto Marinho Airport: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil Flying club). The airport is located in the district of Baixada de Jacarepagu\u00e1, within the municipality of Rio de Janeiro approximately 30 km (19 mi) from the city center.Military airports include:\n\nGale\u00e3o Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase, sharing some facilities with Gale\u00e3o - Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport;\nSanta Cruz Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase. Formerly called Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o Airport, it was built by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. Today it is one of the most important Air Force Bases in Brazil;\nAfonsos Air Force Base: One of the historical Brazilian Air Force airbases. It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea), the Museu Aeroespacial, and where air shows take place.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\n\nThe Port of Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's third busiest port in terms of cargo volume, and it is the center for cruise vessels. Located on the west coast of the Guanabara Bay, it serves the States of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Esp\u00edrito Santo. The port is managed by Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro. The Port of Rio de Janeiro covers territory from the Mau\u00e1 Pier in the east to the Wharf of the Cashew in the north. The Port of Rio de Janeiro contains almost seven thousand metres (23 thousand feet) of continuous wharf and an 883-metre (2,897-foot) pier. The Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro administers directly the Wharf of the Gamboa general cargo terminal; the wheat terminal with two warehouses capable of moving 300 tons of grains; General Load Terminal 2 with warehouses covering over 20 thousand square metres (215 thousand square feet); and the Wharves of Are Cristovao with terminals for wheat and liquid bulk.At the Wharf of Gamboa, leaseholders operate terminals for sugar, paper, iron and steel products. Leaseholders at the Wharf of the Cashew operate terminals for roll-on/roll-off cargoes, containers, and liquid bulk. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over seven million tons of cargo on almost 1700 vessels. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over two million tons of containerized cargo in almost 171 thousand TEUs. The port handled 852 thousand tons of wheat, more than 1.8 million tons of iron and steel, over a million tons of liquid bulk cargo, almost 830 thousand tons of dry bulk, over five thousand tons of paper goods, and over 78 thousand vehicles. In 2003, over 91 thousand passengers moved through the Port of Rio Janeiro on 83 cruise vessels.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, buses are the main form of public transportation. There are nearly 440 municipal bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio's transportation policy has been moving towards trains and subway in order to reduce surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in S\u00e3o Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rio de Janeiro, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 95 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 min, while 35% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 12.3 km, while 37% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Subway and urban trains ====\n\nRio de Janeiro has three subway lines (Metr\u00f4 Rio) with 58 kilometres (36 mi) and 41 stations plus several commuter rail lines. Future plans include building a fourth subway line to Niter\u00f3i and S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, including an underwater tunnel beneath Guanabara Bay to supplement the ferry service currently there. The Metro is Rio's safest and cleanest form of public transport.\n\nThe three lines serve the city seven days a week. The first line runs from General Os\u00f3rio in Ipanema to Uruguai Station in Tijuca. The second line runs from Botafogo, sharing ten stations with the first line, terminating at Pavuna in northern Rio. The third connects General Os\u00f3rio to Jardim Oce\u00e2nico Station, in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, where the 2016 Olympic Games were held. The Metro runs services from 05:00 am to 12:00 midnight, Monday to Saturday, and from 07:00 am to 11:00 pm Sundays and public holidays. People can buy tickets for the Metro at train stations and can either buy single tickets or rechargeable cards. People can also buy tickets for the Metro at buses that make connect places far from the Metro. Integration with buses are possible in several forms, an integrated Metro and bus ticket for a single journey is available for some lines paying an additional fee and is known as an Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Expressa (Express Integration) and Expresso Barra, the other possibility is taking the Metro na Superf\u00edcie (Surface Metro) with no additional fee.SuperVia connects the city of Rio with other locations in Greater Rio de Janeiro with surface trains. It has 8 lines and 270 kilometres (168 mi), with 102 stations.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\n\nIn order to improve traffic in the central zone, the prefecture started the project \"Porto Maravilha\" (Marvelous Port), which foresees a modern tramway system. Its lines will connect the central business district to Santos Dumont Airport, the ferry station at XV Square, the Novo Rio terminal bus station at Santo Cristo, and the future high-speed rail Leopoldina station between Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.In 2016, for the Olympic Games, the light rail system was inaugurated, with 28 km, 42 stations, distributed in 3 lines. The trams are the first in the world to use a combination of ground-level power supply (APS) and on-board supercapacitor energy storage (SRS), in order to eliminate overhead lines along the entire route.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\n\nCity buses cost about R$3.80 to ride. They come in both non-air conditioned (R$3.80) and air conditioned versions (R$3\u2013R$5.40). The system may be relatively safe by day but less so at night. Integration of bus lines has been recently implemented, allowing users to take two non-air conditioned bus rides in two hours paying just one ticket. It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the \"Bilhete \u00danico Carioca (BUC)\") in order to benefit of this system.\nAnother type of local bus is called the \"Fresc\u00e3o\" (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned \u2013 about 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) \u2013 more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$6.00\u2013R$12.00. However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing \"Castelo\").\n\n\n==== Ferry ====\n\nThe most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of Guanabara Bay is Niter\u00f3i. Many people who live in Niter\u00f3i, as well its neighbouring municipalities S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo and Maric\u00e1, commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro (Pra\u00e7a XV) and Niter\u00f3i (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several \"fast cat\" hydrofoil boats.\nOne of the city neighborhoods is Paquet\u00e1 Island, which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquet\u00e1 leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to Cocot\u00e1.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nRio de Janeiro has the oldest operating electric tramway in Brazil and South America, now mainly used by tourists and less by daily commuters. Santa Teresa Tram or bondinho, has been preserved both as a piece of history and as a quick, fun, cheap way of getting to one of the most quirky parts of the city.\n\nThe tram station is near Cinel\u00e2ndia and the Municipal Theatre. Trams leave every half an hour between 6:00 am and 11:00 pm. A ticket is just R$0.60 (US$0.35), one way or return, and people pay as they pass through the barrier to the right of the entrance. The Santa Teresa Tram (known locally as the \"bonde\") in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro commenced electric operation in 1891, replacing horse-drawn trams and expanding the horse-drawn route. At this time the gauge was altered to 1,100 mm (43.31 in), which remains the case today. The tram cars which are currently in operation are Brazilian-built, are of the cross-bench open sided design, and are fitted with trolley poles.After a derail occurred on 28 August 2011, which left seven dead, tram service was suspended to improve the system, and would be reopened in 2014, just before the 2014 FIFA World Cup but after postponements it was finally reopened in July 2015. While it is being improved, two lines costing R$0.60 carry passengers from Santa Teresa to Centro: SE014 and SE006.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDriving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Am\u00e9ricas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common. Because of the organization of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighbourhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Gale\u00e3o International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Am\u00e9ricas).\nIn Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbour States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to S\u00e3o Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niter\u00f3i bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From S\u00e3o Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040. From Salvador: BR-101 or BR-324/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\n\nThe city has 160 km (99 mi) of cycle paths that, wherever they exist, are very much preferable to riding in the city's traffic. Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the Marina da Gl\u00f3ria, Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. six kilometres (3.7 miles) of cycle paths traverse the Tijuca National Park.The Bike Rio began operations in October 2011. This bicycle sharing system is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with Banco Ita\u00fa. The bike sharing system has 600 bicycles available at 60 rental stations in 14 neighborhoods throughout the city.\n\n\n== Communications ==\nThe dialing code for the city of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) is 21.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nRio de Janeiro is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partner cities ===\nRio de Janeiro has the following partner/friendship cities:\n\n\n=== Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities ===\nRio de Janeiro is a part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Movies ===\n\nThe 1979 James Bond movie Moonraker features scenes in Rio de Janeiro including an action sequence on a cable car atop Sugarloaf Mountain between James Bond (Roger Moore) and multiple-time Bond adversary, Jaws (Richard Kiel).\nThe movie Rio and its sequel, Rio 2, were mainly set in Rio de Janeiro and the Amazon rainforest.\nFast and Furious 5 (Fast Five)\nThe Incredible Hulk, where Bruce Banner seeks hiding at Rocinha\n\n\n=== Television ===\nAn episode of Littlest Pet Shop, \"Plane it on Rio\", featured Blythe and the pets going to the Carnival, but an old enemy shows up, determined to defeat them.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nRio de Janeiro appears in the driving game Driver 2 as a city to unlock through playing the game in the Undercover (story) game mode and then being playable in the other game modes.\nAngry Birds Rio featured the birds from the Angry Birds series and characters from Rio freeing exotic birds or defeating Nigel's marmosets in Rio de Janeiro.\nRio de Janeiro was featured in the game Asphalt 8: Airborne as a racing location.\nGangstar Rio: City of Saints, the sixth (or arguably, the seventh) installment overall in the Gangstar series, is (arguably, as this is claimed by the publisher, Gameloft) the first action-adventure video game to be set in Rio de Janeiro.\nRio de Janeiro was featured in the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.\nRio de Janeiro was featured in the racing game Forza Motorsport 6 as a street circuit.  The circuit and all of its configurations were also included in Forza Motorsport 7.\nRio de Janeiro appears as a playable map in Rainbow Six Siege, known as Favela.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of Rio de Janeiro\nList of people from Rio de Janeiro\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRio de Janeiro City Hall website (in Portuguese)\nback to Rio!

        "wiki": "Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [\u02c8k\u027eistu \u0281eden\u02c8to\u0281], local pronunciation: [\u02c8k\u027ei\u0255t\u016d\u033b xe\u031eden\u02c8to\u0266]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nVincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid 1850s to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. In 1889, the country became a republic, and due to the separation of church and state, the proposed statue was dismissed.The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento (\"Monument Week\") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as 'Godlessness' in the society. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the \"Statue of the Christ\" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. The statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms, a symbol of peace, was chosen.\nLocal engineer Heitor da Silva Costa designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work.In 1922, Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who studied sculpture at the Fine Arts Conservatory in Bucharest and in Italy.A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions and felt building the structure of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the cross-shaped statue. The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden. The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931 and cost the equivalent of US$250,000 (equivalent to $3,600,000 in 2019) and the monument opened on October 12, 1931. During the opening ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed 9,200 kilometres (5,700 mi) away in Rome but because of bad weather, the lights were activated on-site.In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion, Archbishop of Rio, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint\u2014Our Lady of the Apparition, under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there.Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to replace some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again, on January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on the right hand.In 2010, a massive restoration of the statue began. Work included cleaning, replacing the mortar and soapstone on the exterior, restoring iron in the internal structure, and waterproofing the monument. Vandals attacked the statue during renovation, spraying paint along the arm. Mayor Eduardo Paes called the act \"a crime against the nation\". The culprits later apologized and presented themselves to the police.In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo's usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, the Pirelli tyre company ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the statue while in an Inter Milan strip. The commercial was controversial with the Catholic Church.In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the statue in Rio de Janeiro was illuminated as a doctor in tribute to the health workers.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nIn 1990, several organizations, including the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, media company Grupo Globo, oil company Shell do Brasil, environmental regulator IBAMA, National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, and the city government of Rio de Janeiro entered an agreement to conduct restoration work.\nMore work on the statue and its environs was conducted in 2003 and early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators, walkways, and elevators were installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding the statue. The four-month restoration in 2010 focused on the statue itself. The statue's internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other microorganisms and repairing small cracks. The lightning rods located in the statue's head and arms were also repaired, and new lighting fixtures were installed at the foot of the statue.The restoration involved one hundred people and used more than 60,000 pieces of stone taken from the same quarry as the original statue.  During the unveiling of the restored statue, it was illuminated with green-and-yellow lighting in support of the Brazil national football team playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.Maintenance work needs to be conducted periodically due to the strong winds and erosion to which the statue is exposed, as well as lightning strikes. The original pale stone is no longer available in sufficient quantity, and replacement stones are increasingly darker in hue.\n\n\n== Similar structures ==\nChrist the Redeemer in Rio Verde, Goi\u00e1s, Brazil\nChrist in the Mount in Pitangui, Minas Gerais, Brazil\nCristo del Otero in Palencia, Spain built in 1930 (21 m)\nCristo Rey (statue, Mexico) located on the Cerro del Cubilete in Guanajuato, Mexico, inspired by Rio's Christ the Redeemer (23 m)\nCristo Rey in Tenancingo, M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico (30 m)\nChrist Blessing in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (30 m)\nChrist of Havana in Havana, Cuba, inspired by Christ the Redeemer (20 m)\nChrist of the Abyss in various underwater locations\nChrist of the Ozarks in Arkansas, United States, inspired by Rio's Christ the Redeemer (20 m)\nChrist of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u in Vietnam (32 m)\nChrist the King in \u015awiebodzin, Poland (33 m)\nChrist the Redeemer of the Andes (Argentina/Chile)\nChrist the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Ibiza, Spain, inspired by Christ the Redeemer (23 m)\nCristo Blanco in Cusco, Peru\nCristo de la Concordia in Cochabamba, Bolivia (34 m)\nCristo de las Noas in Torre\u00f3n, Mexico (22 m)\nCristo del Pac\u00edfico in Lima, Peru, erected in 2011 (37 m)\nPatung Yesus Kristus in Mansinam Island, West Papua, Indonesia (30 m)\nCristo Redentore (Christ the Redeemer) of Maratea, Italy (21 m)\nCristo Rei (Christ the King) in Almada, Portugal (28 m)\nCristo Rei of Dili in Dili, Timor-Leste (27 m)\nCristo Rei, Madeira on Madeira island, completed in 1927 (15 m)\nCristo Rei in Lubango, Angola (14 m)\nStatue of Cristo Luz in Balne\u00e1rio Cambori\u00fa, Santa Catarina, Brazil\nStatue of Jesus Christ on the top of Sagrat Cor, Barcelona, Spain\nTas-Salvatur, Malta (12 m)\nStatue of Jesus Christ, Monte Urgull, Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain - 12 m\nJesus de Greatest in Imo, Nigeria, Africa's tallest statue of Jesus and fifth tallest statue on the continent (8.53 m)\nCristo del Picacho in Tegucigalpa, Honduras\nCristo Redentor, Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic\nChrist The King Lebanon\nAnother imitation statue of Christ the Redeemer is at Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India.(Shrish Patil)\nimitation at Kovalam, near Trivandrum, Kerala, India.\nChrist the Redeemer of Malacca is on the Portuguese Settlement Square in Melaka, Malaysia (20' tall)\nCristo Rey in Colombia (26 m)\nCristo Rey by Urbici Soler in Sunland Park, New Mexico - (8.83 M)\nCristo Redentor (Barranca province, Lima, Peru)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of statues by height\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBlanes, Ruy Llera (2014). \"Review: Giumbelli, Emerson (2014), S\u00edmbolos Religiosos em Controv\u00e9rsia.

It was completed in 1931 and stands 98 feet (30 metres) tall, its horizontally outstretched arms spanning 92 feet (28 metres). The statue, made of reinforced concrete clad in a mosaic of thousands of triangular soapstone tiles, sits on a square stone pedestal base about 26 feet (8 metres) high, which itself is situated on a deck atop the mountain\u2019s summit. The statue is the largest Art Deco-style sculpture in the world and is one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most recognizable landmarks.Christ the Redeemer statue, Rio de Janeiro.\u00a9 sfmthd/FotoliaIn the 1850s the Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado to honour Isabel, princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, although the project was never approved. In 1921 the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro proposed that a statue of Christ be built on the 2,310-foot (704-metre) summit, which, because of its commanding height, would make it visible from anywhere in Rio. Citizens petitioned Pres. Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa to allow the construction of the statue on Mount Corcovado.Statue of Christ the Redeemer, Rio de Janeiro.Jeremy Woodhouse\u2014Digital Vision/Getty ImagesPermission was granted, and the foundation stone of the base was ceremonially laid on April 4, 1922\u2014to commemorate the centennial on that day of Brazil\u2019s independence from Portugal\u2014although the monument\u2019s final design had not yet been chosen. That same year a competition was held to find a designer, and the Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa was chosen on the basis of his sketches of a figure of Christ holding a cross in his right hand and the world in his left. In collaboration with Brazilian artist Carlos Oswald, Silva Costa later amended the plan; Oswald has been credited with the idea for the figure\u2019s standing pose with arms spread wide. The French sculptor Paul Landowski, who collaborated with Silva Costa on the final design, has been credited as the primary designer of the figure\u2019s head and hands. Funds were raised privately, principally by the church. Under Silva Costa\u2019s supervision, construction began in 1926 and continued for five years. During that time materials and workers were transported to the summit via railway.Christ the Redeemer statue on Mount Corcovado (foreground), overlooking Rio de Janeiro.Jeremy Woodhouse\u2014Digital Vision/Getty ImagesAfter its completion, the statue was dedicated on October 12, 1931. Over the years it has undergone periodic repairs and renovations, including a thorough cleaning in 1980, in preparation for the visit of Pope John Paul II to Brazil that year, and a major project in 2010, when the surface was repaired and refurbished. Escalators and panoramic elevators were added beginning in 2002; previously, in order to reach the statue itself, tourists climbed more than 200 steps as the last stage of the trip. In 2006, to mark the statue\u2019s 75th anniversary, a chapel at its base was consecrated to Our Lady of Aparecida, the patron saint of Brazil.Christ the Redeemer statue on Mount Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro.iStockphoto/Thinkstock\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\n ",

          "magnificent, I recommend to do it as a part of a tour with other memorable places in Rio! The scenes are beautiful!",
          "This is what brought me to Rio and I wasn't disappointed at all. The statue is really huge and the views up where the statue stood were great. However, I noticed some tiny flies up there. Not sure what those were but my hand itched when bitten. Perhaps should apply some insect",
          "It was an incredible experience. Make sure to visit. Check the weather forecast for a complete and hassle-free experience.",
          "I recommend anyone that likes sightseeing to take a look at the Christ of redeemer statue you can go by van by taking the metro to Largo do Machado and it\u2019s very easy to find the ticketing place to get tickets for the van ride round trip to see the Christ of redeemer statue it",
          "The best time to go is very early in the morning as the lines form quickly. There is an elevator and 2 escalators to the top. And it is usually very crowded at the top.",
          "One has to visit this amazing site while in Rio. It\u2019s larger than life! The nice thing as well is I could see this from my hotel as well. The train trip up the mountain is fun as well.",
          "It was late afternoon when we visited as part of an organised tour. There were few queues but the top was very busy. The statue was very impressive and the little chapel underneath was beautiful. The views were great but it was difficult to get to them because of the crowd",
          "We went to visit with a tour that drove us to the bus level. We then took a bus up to the actual monument. Unfortunately the statue was completely covered in cloud. Of course this was quite disappointing. So we decided to try again the next day. We took an Uber from our hotel",
          "CHRIST the REDEEMER, I was saving these pictures to be able to post at this time. I always thought about the day that I would be able to see the CHRIST the REDEEMER. It was absolutely spectacular, I was not disappointed. For me, what was shocking, was how small the statue was.",
          "Landmark sightseeing spot, super view of Rio and the surrounding. Bit pricey but hey its a one time thing to do while in Rio for sure. The train ride on top was one of the best part of this journey! Bit too rowdy at the top in mid afternoon, try to go earlier in the day!",
          "The tourist crowd changes up to the season and during the day. Ask to the hotel concierge the best moment and the best way to have acces. Beware during cloudy days.Breathtaking post card view.",
          "We were very impressed by the size of the status, you feel very small when you stand beside of it. The view from up there is fantastic.",
          "If the visibility was not zero! Very rainy, cold and foggy when we went. Could barely see the statue itself! Shame. Not the fault of the site. Would have been excellent if the weather was better.",
          "Was a great way to see the site of Rio. Was very interested and informative. I would recommend this tour to everyone",
          "Wow, quite an amazing sight. Crowded as one would expect but still jaw dropping construction and fabulous views. You can see all of the main sights around Rio from here. It was lit up with all the flags of countries affected by Covid19. Profound.",
          "too crowded and usually also too cloudy. still it is a unique experience not to be missed when in Rio",
          "Visiting the Christ the Redeemer Statue was one of the stops I was really looking forward to as a highlight of my trip to Brazil ... Mother Nature had other plans. The weather on the day of my visit was terrible. I couldn't anything from the top of the mountain and the statue",
          "Highlight of the trip! My wife and I hiked 2.5 miles and 2000 feet to the top of Corcovado to Christ the Redeemer statue. The hike was challenging and tons of fun. We did it in about an hour or so. We saw monkeys which my wife absolutely loved! It was super crowded when we got",
          "There are many ways to get to the top I would not recommend walking. Taxi's are okay but you are better off with a tour. They get you to the top the easiest. once there the views of Rio are spectacular. The statue itself is most impressive. Be prepared of being mixed in a large",
          "We went to Christ the Redeemer and this was my second time. Manu Peclat was our guide and I learned so much more about this landmark . This is a must see in Rio !",
          "Compared to the Sugarloaf mountain, the view from the Christ statue is 2 times better. I liked how we watched over the beach and city where all the party was going on. Carnaval is a dream. We had to wait for a bit to get up there, but it was worth waiting. You might be",
          "Again this is a must while in Rio,again it was part of our package and it was very busy.A little cable car train takes you up to the monument and it\u2019s quite scenic but again the queues are large. The scenes are stunning whilst up there but people are lying all over the ground",
          "Was fun ride up on the Cogwheel train. Once we arrived the views were spectacular and of course seeing the Redeemer up close was awesome. The only downside is the crowds. It was difficult to move at times there were so many people.",
          "Go early and check the weather before you go. Our hotel in Ipanema had a view of Christ the redeemer so we checked to make sure it was clear in the mountains before we went.",
          "Christ the Redeemer is a must see when you are in Rio. It was so exciting something I have always wanted to see. make sure you see the little Chapel at the base of the statue.",
          "The statue is bigger than you can imagine, and is a visual landmark throughout the city of Rio. The crowds can be horrendous, so amuse yourself with the tourists laying on their backs to get the full statue in their photo. The views of the city from atop the mountain are also",
          "It is very impressive to go up to see this beautiful statue, we were impressed because during all our walks in Rio it is possible to see this beautiful statue which therefore accompanied us throughout our journey",
          "Was nice to tick off the list as done. However not much to it when your up there. Was very very busy.",
          "When somebody says Rio \u2013 in your mind appear words and images: beaches and Statue of Christ the Redeemer. This statue become a cultural icon of Rio de Janeiro. In our first evening walk on Copacabana beach we saw this statue brightly illuminated on the background of dark skies.",
          "It took about 30 minutes from cruise port to the Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca national park. We arrived at 10, already very crowded and busy, and a challenge to take decent photos, but our guide sat on the ground and managed to take good photos of us with the statue as",
          "Amazing place!!! The view of Rio de Janeiro is breathtaking!!! Take the tram!! If it\u2019s summer time, go early, it\u2019s very hot!!!",
          "Nothing that I can add to what's already been said, except maybe one thing. I bought two statues from the gift shop in the ticketing area. I wondered about the pricing and whether or not I'd be paying a huge premium by purchasing them here. So I checked prices at various places",
          "An extremely interesting tourist attraction. A must see for all tourists visiting Rio de Janeiro. The view from the top is stunning.",
          "Incredible place to be Easy to get to we went by Christ van and it was easy no queues in February very well set up even a lift if you can\u2019t do steps very impressed",
          "Visited this beautiful wonder of the world on our first day in Brazil. We where unsure on whether to book in advance or buy tickets online. But we opted to get a uber from our hotel right to the top. And then used there bus which takes you to this beauty. This is the most",
          "The statue is huge and the crowds of visitors likewise. I\u2019d recommend being part of a small tour or private tour guide, so that you can glide past and lines. Try to do it early in the day - before the crowds and the heat of the day. The views are spectacular and I would",
          "You get a great view! It's would probably be nice to see a sunset but when I was there it was shrouded in clouds around that time. I would suggest to just go if it's clear weather and to take the train (Best view is on right going up).",
          "Unless you love trains grab a taxi to the higher level terminal and go up in the minibus. This will save a lot of queuing. The statue is great as you would expect and to stand under the shade and enjoy the views are a must. We also took a helicopter flight around it from",
          "If your in Rio you have to to this. Yes it\u2019s busy and yes every man and his dog wants the perfect picture with the statue but the views are spectacular.",
          "A must see wonder of the world! A wonderful drive up the mountain overlooking Rio De Janeiro. The favelas clinking to the hills were amazing. All of Rio in front of you, views across to Sugar Loaf Mountain, such a beautiful city. Christ the Redeemer statue was amazing but",
          "Had been a gloomy morning before it started to rain later in the noon and after waiting for almost 30 minutes ... only saw a misty figure of the colossal statue! But was good enough as not to see anything at all!",
          "We went there during a time of \"no visibility\" which meant we could not see the view over Rio due to clouds. However it was still great as we could still see Christ de Remedeer quite clearly and got some good photos of the statue in the clouds. The train ride up is good. I would",
          "A life long dream realised. Totally amazing. A busy place but so well organized. If you are in Rio I suggest a taxi then buy your own ticket rather than an excursion as it will cost a lot less.",
          "Due to fog, we were not able to see any of the statue, even when standing beneath it. Quite a trek to reach it, so don't bother going if the mountain is covered in fog or rain.",
          "Badly managed crowds of people. Very selfish visitors laying on ground and outstretching arms for that perfect photo totally unacceptable behavioir. NO crowd control at all !!!! A MUST place to visit in Rio of course but it was NOT a good experience. Great views !",
          "Very crowded but worth the view. This spot is an essential spot for a first time tourist in rio. We see it with c2rio tours and it was great!",
          "Rio de Janeiro is well known for the statue of the Christ the Redeemer located on top of Corcovado mountain approximately 2400 feet high. This magnificent statue is the center for all Catholics visiting Rio. I tell you, when you get to the top, you\u2019ll feel blessed. A wonderful",
          "Well, I do have a problem with heights but after reading someones review on this and how they dealt with it I decided to give it a go. We went up by tram which I felt helped. You couldn't really see much aside from trees, flowers and bushes so no sense of impending doom. Once",
          "We probably picked one of the poorest days to visit this spectacular site as the weather was cloudy and it was slightly wet. The ride up the mountain in the funicular railway was brilliant and extremely enjoyable. You have to walk/climb a little further to reach the monument,",
          "Buy your ticket online. Get on the wait line if you arrive early and you will probably get up before your reservation. Great views. Big statue!!!!! Had no problems with anyone being rude. Train was well organized.",
          "It's a beautiful destination with a great view and its only a half day activity. The only downside is the transportation up the hill,the locals offer shuttle services to go up and there very unorganized.Other option is the train, and depending on what time you get there, it mite",
          "if you are religious or not, you must go to Cristo Corcovado. This place is giving you good vibes and great views all-around Rio",
          "Definitely worth seeing, the statue is so lifelike and it looks out over Rio, it\u2019s an amazing site to be so close up too!",
          "A definite must in Rio. Try to go early to avoid the crowds. We took the train about which takes around 20 minutes. You can apparently buy tickets days in advance to avoid the lines. Hopefully, you will have a clear day and you can see forever! You can also drive most of the way",
          "A lengthy drive up the mountain to a place where special minibuses take over and transport you to the base of the statue. You get your ticket and can use the elevator (electric stairs) to get to the top or use the stairs. Very busy when we were there but phenomenal views over",
          "This attraction is also well know but far too crowded on the day we visited. Wall to wall people & long lines. Even some people lying on the ground trying to get a better photo. Funicular ride is spectacular also ,clean & well maintained. 200 stairs to climb at the top but there",
          "We went up in the train which was very civilised. There were a lot of people but there was a party mood being carnival week. The views were amazing and everything was perfect",
          "The wife and I had a wonderful trip to the Christ the Redeemer and got some great pictures. The area at first was overcast but the \"high power\" gave us a 10 minute window to shot pictures and admire the whole view. We also got to see some \"baby monkeys\" down by the restaurant",
          "The greatest view of Rio, under the shadow of Cristo Redentor. Simply fantastic. Easy to get to by public transport, suggest buying timed tickets in advance.",
          "Of course, as its a wonder of the world, visiting this monument is nkt to be missed. The trek to get there (drive, train,cable) is an exciting journey. Once there the views are amazing too! The only negative is the rush of people,you dont get enough time to savour the beauty in",
          "We had a nice trip up there; got a taxi for the first stretch, then the shuttle bus. Was a cloudy day unfortunately but managed to get clear photos for 5 minutes. Nice atmosphere up there, although maybe a bit too crowded, and plenty of places to buy souvenirs. Ate at the",
          "Go with an organised trip. You need to change buses before going up hill as it\u2019s a steep ride. When tger3 there are lifts & escalators. Lovely views, the statue amazing. Many people there, we went at 11am, fantastic views.",
          "Excellent tour of Christ the Redeemer. The tour arrived early so the number of tourists was lower. We took a shuttle, transferred to another shuttle which took us to the top of the hill. An escalator takes you to the top. It was a clear morning, another reason to go early as",
          "Amazing place. It always seemed something extraordinary, and I was here! Great view of Rio ...and great pictures, of course...",
          "The place is truly \"different dimensions\". You cannot believe your eyes. You travel there up by a train through a jungle in the heart of the city. Monkeys are jumping and looking at you. And then you see something that you cannot believe exist. Outstanding experience! And you",
          "We decided to wait until the Rio carnival had finished and the rain had stopped. We chose the perfect day which was a gamble as the weather constantly changes. We timed it perfectly arriving by Uber and then taking the mini van up to the top around 8am to purchase tickets.",
          "We booked the tram tickets online the day before via the official website. While the website is only in Portuguese, we used Google chrome for translation and managed to book our 820am tickets. We didn\u2019t see a long queue at the ticket counter when we were so I guess it\u2019s fine to",
          "Complicated and made more so by all the RAIN and overcast\ud83d\ude10. Got on internet from our nearby guesthouse and found it difficult to chose a TIME. Got to the statue and couldn't see a thing!!! By the time we were to order a beer and wait it out VOILA!!! WHAT a madhouse! Who CARES?",
          "We bought timed tickets online for the Carnaval Monday. I recommend you do the same since this is way more popular than Sugarloaf. When you get there the attendant will check your passport and credit card and ask you to sign your ticket printout. After this walk straight ahead",
          "Our private guide took us here late morning. It wasn't too crowded when we first arrived (around 10am), but it sure got congested quickly! It was a cloudy/rainy day. Fortunately for us, our private guide said we could wait there until the clouds cleared enough for awesome",
          "Went on a beautiful day and had an excellent view especially in the viewing platform. It\u2019s was hard to get there but had the best photos, if you don\u2019t get photo bombed.",
          "That is the highlight of our tour. We was lucky and there was short line to get the train up the hill a d we had a clear sky. On the peak we found lots of young people lying on their back on the floor trying to take pictures of the huge statue. It was difficult to move around.",
          "My partner propsed to me here. Wonderful experience... Love love love. It was misty... Cleared up.... Wonderful view of rio",
          "It was an amazing trip , the view from up there was unbelievable. You can see each part of the city from every angle. Christ was so big it made it a little difficult to take a good picture .",
          "You cannot visit Rio and miss Corcovado - if the weather is clear take the opportunity to change your schedule if necessary as the experience would not be the same without the 360 degree views. It is busy of course but if you are a senior you can jump the queue for the mini bus",
          "The statue of Christ the Redemer is the most famous symbol of Rio. We were not lucky being there in thick fog. But still...we saw Christ",
          "The statue and view was amazing. The downside was that the top were too crowded. When going down, we ended up walking to the second stop for the train because the line was too long.",
          "Amazing, lost for words how special it was to see Christ the Redeemer. Was so crowded with so many people taking photos, not admiring what is so special in front of your phons. Make sure to take a moment and appreciate the views and count your bleasings to see something so",
          "Iconic site in Rio and a must visit. Very crowded but still worth it. The special aspect is you don't see it all the way up the mountain until you step out of the lift.",
          "We visited Christ the Redeemer a few weeks go, and definitely enjoyed going. We got a few photos of the statue itself, but not much else. Unfortunately it was pretty foggy that day, and we didn't get to enjoy the view of the city and surroundings below. We only had a few days in",
          "Must visit. Even good in the rain. Expensive shops as expected. Booked as part of a tour so was organised really well.",
          "This is one of those rare things that is worth doing a tour for. Ours was seamless, or as much as it could be. We didn\u2019t have to wait in lines and the transportation was smooth. We went during Carnival, so it was incredibly busy. Our tour also took us to sugarloaf and a",
          "My daughter and I enjoyed this adventure. There is a little park next to the left of the Corcovado entrance that can keep your little ones occupied while waiting for your boarding time for the train. We made it to the top by the steps but I\ufe0f was so so glad to find the escalator",
          "Huge numbers of people come here and all try and take the best photo so it gets very crowded and hectic. The top of the statue was in and out of clouds when we visited so it was difficult to get a good photo. Access is easy - first a train for 20 minutes up hill, then an",
          "Despite the popularity of the site with other tourists, we enjoyed the beautiful views. If you're in Rio, this is a must visit!",
          "This is a very popular attraction, it is one of the new seven wonders of the world so it is going to be busy. However if you come with the expectation of disorganised chaos and try and go with the flow then it will be bearable. Otherwise you will get very angry with the number",
          "Beautiful views but as everywhere in modern times, be prepared for hundreds of people and Instagram wannabes",
          "Wow, seen this so many times in the media. I have now seen it in the flesh so to speak. I knew he was going to be big, but the experience was so much better than I excepted. It was breathtaking. The views around Rio were amazing. We were lucky to have a clear afternoon and",
          "Our day started with punctual pick up from our hotel,fist stop Christ the Redeemer.Line moved more quickly than I expected. The statue is stunning. Enormous. Spectacular views and a beautiful chapel. Definitely worth booking a tour,beats waiting in line!",
          "I visited during a clear day, and the views from above were absolutely gorgeous; I definetly recommend going here during the day, and getting some sunset views from Pao de A\u00e7\u00facar/Sugarloaf. The statue of Christ the Redeemer is a world renowned monument, but the area close to it",
          "He certainly lives up to the hype. You might be intimidated by the queues but certainly it is all worthwhile, getting that trolley car (whatever you call it) right up to the top and seeing this magnificent statue. Note there is a place of worship there too. His presence is",
          "It would be hard to come to Rio and not visit Christ the Redeemer. We nearly had to do that as it was covered in cloud for our first few days. But one morning it was moving in and out of cloud so we quickly booked tickets online and got an uber to the cog train. It was a fun",
          "I know it\u2019s difficult to do, but ignore the crowds, and think about this: you are standing in front of a global icon, one of the new seven wonders of the world, looking down at the Rio coastline, which is also one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Surely the fact that",
          "Great experience, orderly in terms of getting there. Couldn't believe there were escalators! Views are incredible.",
          "Fantastic trip to Corcovado, clear blue sky and no clouds. Followed advice and arrived at 8:15am. Minimum queue and we had space to wander about at the top. Still busy but it was hectic by the time we left at 10am. Train was very efficient and now there is a lift and escalators",
          "One of the best ways to the Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) is to take the train. It\u2019s super modern and takes about 15 minutes to get to the top on a very steep rack & pinion track. Once at the top, take the elevator to the summit or walk up the steps. Top tip? Go",
          "it was exciting to see christ the redeemer and felt like a dream come true. Rio is a great place to be.",
          "A wonderful experience, the feeling once you are there is beyond, We took an Uber to get there and paid for the tickets to go up.I will recommended there is no need to go with a guide is very easy to get there.",
          "No visit to Rio would be complete without a visit to this monument. Even though there was intermittent cloud cover and not a nice, sunny day. There is no doubt that the awesomeness is there. A must see.",
          "Fantastic sailing through the clouds Train ride is awesome Views out o er Ipenema and cococabana were stunning",
          "14 February 2020. There are several ways to get to the statue. I had meant to use the train (Trem do Corcovado) which leaves from R. Cosme Velho, 513, Rio de Janeiro, but I accidentally put the park visitor center (Centro de Visitantes) into my Uber destination. These are two",
          "OMG! Even though we have all seen this statue in pictures it is still something to be seen in person. It is soooo big. We were very lucky when we went up to the statue because we had a clear morning. By the afternoon it was hidden in clouds. It is a must see.",
          "Understanding where to buy the ticket and where to go up is a real mess. Is not explained anywhere.....I\u2019m here since 11:00 and got a ticket for 13:30. A real waste of time......",
          "Beautiful monument, must see if in Rio. It is a good idea to getbthere as early as possible as understandably, it gets very busy. It is a long drive up the mountain but still many steps to get to the top. Need to be reasonably fit !! As it is so high ofter weather and low cloud",
          "Book the train tickets online, get Uber too the train station. The views are great, lots of people at the top , but worth the visit.",
          "A train journey to the top, very comfortable and fun. The statue is really impressive. The panoramic views are spectacular, the whole thing deserving to be a wonder of the modern world. The only drawback is the crowds of tourists so you have to be careful where you tread; advice",
          "A must visit ,iconic The train journey was well worth the price.Great views over Rio de Janeiro and the weather was excellent..",
          "We were a little unlucky when we went as it was raining and there were clouds, which diminished the view and an hour after we left they were none - typical!!! We took a very steep train ride up to the top of the mountain, walked up around 200 stairs (there are lifts available",
          "The access to Corcovado is by train, starting in Cosme Velho Station, following the preserved Tijuca Forest until the top of the hill. In the top is possible to view the main parts of Rio de Janeiro City, including Sugar Loaf, Maracana, Guanabara Bay and others. It is",
          "One of my bucket list fulfilled. This is a must see in the city. Too bad It was raining and foggy on the day of our visit so we didn\u2019t get to see the surrounding area or sugar loaf mountain from the site but the statue itself is spectacular. Enjoyed the train ride through the",
          "Been here on few occasions. Best way to get there is by Uber. Ask him to drop you at Corcovado train station as it\u2019s worth the experience traveling to the top via the cog train. Once at the top you have to deal with good few flights of stairs before reaching the statue. On your",
          "It\u2019s the iconic image and mountain of a Rio so it\u2019s a no brainer. Opens at 8am and the busses start dropping the tourists off at 10 so get there early or fight the crowds. No further review is necessary.",
          "I went to Rio for 10 days and on the second to last day was the only day that God opened the sky's and permitted the sun to shine and eliminate all the clouds. We went to the tram station to purchase our tickets at noon and upon arriving the next tickets were for 4 hours later.",
          "Being at the base of the statue is humbling indeed. Seeing the surrounding Rio area from that vantage point, from the perspective of the Christ the Redeemer statue adds interesting contemplative perspective.",
          "Clearly one of the \"must sees\" in Rio. Several ways to get to the top (including biking or walking for those so disposed). We took bus shuttles....if you take the bus option make sure you get tickets for both shuttles. Just as we arrived at the top, it started to pour raining",
          "Came here as part of a tour party. For the best views on the train, aim to get a seat on the side nearest the platforms facing downhill. Lovely views from up top. Can get crowded. look out for the monkeys.",
          "Great site to visit in Rio and you will be amazed by stunning view of Rio from the top. I really like tram ride to there.",
          "We spent the morning visiting the statue. Would recommend getting an early morning tour to beat the crowds. It gets insanely busier not long after it opens. The views from the top are amazing. However, be wary that the weather can be unpredictable and views could be spoilt.",
          "Panoramic views of Rio all around you, as you take in the amazing, spiritual experience that Christ the Redeemer is. Went on early am tour, to try to avoid crowds as much as possible, lots of tourists there anyway. Weather is unpredictable, best to have plan B , if possible. We",
          "Nobody can come to Brazil of even South America without visiting this iconic statue. Soaring above Rio it\u2019s a tribute to the city and country. We took the 15 minute train ride to the top and then the lifts and steps to the base of the statute. The pure scale and size is amazing.",
          "We travelled up using the lovely little train which was a thrill in itself. Once up there, the scale of the statue was breathtaking. Wonderful views of Rio de Janiero and while we were up there we were lucky to witness a baby being christened in the chapel behind the statue. If",
          "Yes, it's crowded, but the work-around is to visit on a weekday and preferably very early/late in the day. It's also a great idea to purchase tickets online. If you wait until your visit, you may find yourself waiting several hours for an available seat on the tram. You can of",
          "Incredibly busy. This is a place of pilgrimage for Brazilians and South Americans from far and wide as well as tourists from Asia, Australasia, Europe and North America so expect it to be heaving. Well worth it though. Simply awe inspiring and amazing views across every part of",
          "Took a train up the mountain to the Christ the redemer. Well worth seeing brilliant views over Rio De Janerio.",
          "What a magnificent statue. Very crowded but worth the visit. I wouldnt go a 2nd time..but enjoyed y visit",
          "Whether you're a tourist or not, and you're in the city of Rio de Janeiro, don't forget to take a stroll there. A unique contact with nature. I recommend going when the weather is sunny, because the clouds affect the photos. But even with clouds, I loved it and recommend it,",
          "Probably the most important monument in Rio but don't get your hopes up. While it offers decent views the wait for transport and tickets almost makes the visit not worth while, if you are going to see jt, make sure it is in off peak times",
          "Was visited as part of a tour for the day so we knew where to go and what to do. You traverse the hillside very quickly to reach the point of the entrance. Bus ride to the steps is comfortable and efficient. It was a really hot day when we visited and there is very little shade",
          "The most known attraction in Rio De Janeiro is the Christ the Redeemer. To reach there you have to use a small train (jagged rail), and after you have to choose to use steps or the elevatores. Some times happens that one of them does not operate. There is too many people (This",
          "Great ride up the mountain curves, elevators and escalators all worked well and saved thousands of steps and stairs. And when you get there, the view of the city is marvelous and the statue is.....amazing. No wonder this has been an attraction since the thirties when it was",
          "Picked the nicest day you can ever ask for. Clear skies, infinite visibility with NO haze. Can\"t ask for a better view of this fabulous city.",
          "One of the places that you have to visit in Rio De Janeiro, the easier way to go is from lido square in Copacabana beach, it is around 30 mins journey with a very comfortable van.",
          "This is an amazing place! but sadly it was raining and our tour guide was a boring , sour faced girl who hurried us everywhere. Passion Brazil as a tour company need to employ more friendly guides",
          "Fantastic views but far too crowded people fighting to take a photo. Try to go early There are ample toilets and there are gift shops. But souvenir too expensive. Chestier downtown on Copacabana beach.",
          "You get on a rack train to get you from the base of the mountain to the top, which offfers pleasant views on both sides. After you arrive at the top station, take the escalators up to the patio area surrounding the statue. From here the views are stunning, giving you a 360",
          "The train up to the top was beautiful, travelling through lush, green urban forest with fruit laden trees visible. Once up the top the views were just breath taking. There are a couple of restuarants too. It was funny to see people laying on the floor in an effort to capture",
          "Be prepared for a LONG wait to come down from the mountain on a busy day. It appears that there is only 1 train that goes up and down the mountain. So I'd recommend going very early or late evening.",
          "Contrary to what we thought when we got here, there are places in Brazil where you can't just grab any girl you want and go to town. We nearly got kicked out of this place, and my friend got slapped in the face. Not cool. The views are excellent though.",
          "this is my 3rd time to visit Christ the Redeemer but this time i saw it from the aerial view and its fantastic. Highly recommended....",
          "Our 5th New Wonder we have had the opportunity of visiting. When the tour we booked at the hotel failed to show up we decided to venture off on our own. Took a Uber to the site without an issue at all. Once there bought the entrance pass and really enjoyed the whole experience.",
          "Tickets and train ran very smoothly, overall the experience lived up to my expectations, the only downside is the crowds but those are somewhat unavoidable.",
          "What can I say.. this is just great!. My family and I went to this place and it's absolutely amazing!",
          "One of the Rionmost famous spot. Good visit and Tijuca park is just amazing. I recommand to follow the ride in the Tijuca park where you will find an amazing view on Rio",
          "Well worth the trip but in peak times you may have to wait up to 2 hrs for a tram up. Easy access and not expensive, the views are stupendous",
          "The highlight of Rio is CtR. You can't help but to be in awe, not only of Redeemer, but of where you are in the world and the amazing views that surround you. To visit, plan ahead, go EARLY!!! Line ups can be hours long. We had an 8AM reservation and when we came back (about",
          "Great stop but get there early. A tour guide would be a big advantage to get you through quickly on on to your next stop.",
          "The statue of Christ is located on top of a hill. It looks great and appears as if Christ is blessing all. One can reach the top by using elevator and escalators. From the hilltop one can view the beautiful city of Rio.",
          "This is worth the fee. It is a giant statue and many people were lying on the ground to get the best shot. The statue is massive and worth seeing up close. The views from there are gorgeous.",
          "Great view of the city and of course the huge Jesus statue. It\u2019s best to go early, after 10am the line queues are ridiculously long. We went at 830am.",
          "Went end of November, go early in the morning. Even going mid morning it was very crowded at the top. Selfie central, packed in, hold onto kiddos but awesome views and a must see bucket list item. Great fruit juices at the refreshment stand immediately below stand.",
          "I finally got to see one of the 7 wonders of the world. This status actually might bring tears to your eyes.",
          "great view of southern Rio, but in cloudy days is commom to have zero visibility, that\u00b4s why I dont recommend to get the ticket in advance, go there, in case the weather is ok, buy it, if not...try another tour !",
          "The statue is wonderful from a distance, but a visit is a real waste of time. The queues are horrendous (expect 3 hours or more in blazing sun even after you have paid and your group has been called). And when you get to the top the place is swarming with idiots trying to take",
          "Get there early before it gets too crowded. A must see if you are in Rio. A one on one tour is also a great way to get thru the crowds.",
          "It is a site with an exceptional view of the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, it is a destination that one must visit, perhaps the bad thing is that you must go in the morning because in the afternoon it is often cloudy.",
          "A must see! It was crowded but it was worth the wait. An unforgetable experience. The views from the city from up there are amazing!",
          "Visited the Corcovado with my family in an arranged tour by the hotel, the location was great, children friendly even with a stroller.. One advice, make sure you check the forecast before you plan your tour :).",
          "I have wanted to see Christ the Redeemer for as long as I can remember and the statue certainly didn't disappoint. It is huge and commanding and looks out over the city so that it seems to be visible everywhere, It is beautiful and seeing it is a very spiritual experience only",
          "On a Saturday 2pm train there were no lines at all to buy the tickets. If you have a credit card, there is a special terminal, where you can choose a language of your choice to navigate. The process is smooth and fast. In addition, there is a place to get some water, ice cream",
          "We had to do it... You HAVE to do it. 'Cristo' is likely one of the top sites on the entire continent, so of course you're going to go. You can see \"him\" (it) from countless spots in the city, but you still have to go. You know it's going to be extremely crowded, hot, pushy,",
          "most beautiful place in the world. beutiful view. not so expensive to buy souvenirs up high. the oficial photo is too expensive, though",
          "It is a must - and get there early. Bit tricky orientation so keep asking the staff and get your wristband. It helps being identified as Skip the Q people",
          "The train and the statue was kinda cool. But the same as tourist places around the world. You go there, look and then you\u2019re done. Nothing mind blowing but I guess it\u2019s a must see when visiting Rio",
          "Stunning views from the Mountain. Lots of Tourists so be prepared to wait your turn to get decent photos, and a clear shot of Christ The Redeemer. A truly magnificent Statue. Very Spiritual place",
          "This is an amazing sight but it gets very busy and there are time slots for the train to get to the top. We arrived there at about 10 and the first available train was at 2 pm , so my advice is to either get there early or book your time slot online. There are also mini bus taxi",
          "A must do when you're in Rio as you all know. We played Russian roulette with the clouds but made it a bit more exciting. No one can guarantee the weather so I'm not complaining I enjoyed it thoroughly",
          "Packed with people, but worth coming and seeing. The views are stunning, as long as there are no clouds, so suggesting to check the forecast before booking.",
          "Spectacular views but try to get on the first vans going up (around 8am), my 10am it is a madhouse. Also consider taking pictures at the lower level when everyone else is up top",
          "This is one of the must sees in Rio de Janeiro.But be there very early in the morning to avoid queues.",
          "I have always wanted to visit Corcovado. It was extremely crowded and a little unorganized when trying to enter. Great views from the top and the Redeemer is truly incredible and breathtaking.",
          "It was a cloudy day and all felt a bit blah! It's crowded with selfie hungry tourists seeking the perfect angle, but generally didn't feel the WOW factor I have in places like the Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower!",
          "The views from Christ the Redeemer are some of the best views of the city that are on offer. Despite this, I personally preferred the views from Sugar Loaf mountain, but I know some people that thought the contrary. I highly recommend having a guide as they are always locals",
          "It\u2019s visible from every part of Rio & is simply stunning & divine. There are many ways to go up but the best one is by train or bus that takes only 5 minutes. Must go at sunset time as it looks beautiful when the lights come on",
          "Christ the Redeemer has made the list of one of the new 7 wonders of the world. Build in the beginning of the 1900's, it is the most recognizable Jesus Christ monuments in the world with many many copies, but did you know that it wasn't suppose to be a Christ Statue? I'll tell",
          "Beautiful views and very crowded. It\u2019s best to go early in the morning to avoid the crowds. If you are afraid of heights this is it not the place for you. Great place to snap photos.",
          "We vist it at the 26.12.2019 It is much prettier in reality than in pictures. You see an amazing view for Rio, I also could capture the lagoa and shown the christmas tree in the middle of the water, also I could capture the hourse race place. The words can't describe the",
          "Definitely worth the visit. We would suggest getting a fast pass and using the tram up. I have done it twice, by bus and tram. The tram is certainly the best option for a view perspective.",
          "This is a must see when visiting Rio From almost everywhere you are at night you see this symbol . To be up close and see the view of the city is magical. Best deal is to buy the tickets on line and skip the line and best time is first thing in the morning.",
          "Christ the Redeemer looks down on Rio; you must go to the top to see his view! Don't let the crowds turn you off, there's plenty of space when you get there. The vista of the city is incredible. DON'T MISS IT!",
          "Everything is already said about the Crist. Amazing views. Just make sure you visit on a day when the peak is not covered by clouds.",
          "It's definitely a must see while in Rio, but be prepared for the crowd.This was our tour's first stop and while we got there at 9am, there were already a lot of people at the top taking pictures. Everyone's posing with their arms spread out and people taking the photos are",
          "We booked the tour at Rio cruise terminal. First, they took us to take a look of Maracan\u00e3 stadium (outside) and Sambodromo. Then you go through a road to The Corcovado where the Statue of Cristo Redentor is. There you must buy a ticket to take another bus to the Cristo. It was",
          "Everyone plans a visit to the iconic and amazing statue. After my experience I'd say that the view you have from other points in the city is better than the hassle of going up to Corcovado. The system is just a big mess, very disorganized. You spend too much time queuing in the",
          "If you're in Rio, you will of course have this on top of your list. The attraction is very well organised with a group system to the top, avoiding overcrowding. Great for those selfies. The only thing I would advise you of is that no matter the time of year, the statue is above",
          "You've made it all the way to Rio - so Christ the Redeemer is a must do! 3 million tourists a year visit it so I suggest you go early to avoid at least some of the crowd. Tip: if you're in Rio for several days go on the day that is the clearest! Yes it gets very crowded, but as",
          "It was crowded but the facilities are well organised. There are escalators for those who are not so mobile. It is very special to be so close to this famous landmark, set in the urban forest. Unforgettable trip!",
          "This was amazing and in itself a reason to come to Rio. Our tour guide was awesome at explaining everything to us. I feel like I waited my whole life for this experience",
          "Early on a December Monday morning I embarked on a trip to this famous landmark. The sky was blue , the temperature was rising , factor 50 needed and shoulders covered I and about 15 others wound our way through suburban Rio , up a steep and bumpy road , skirting the jungle and",
          "But boy is it crowded. Go early if you can. Purchase tickets online if you want to go up at peak days/ times",
          "We had an early tour, so got up before 9am to hopefully beat the crowds! Still very busy, but all done and dusted by 1030hrs! Started to get really busy after that and the road up to the monument started to get a bit gridlocked! Get up as early as you can and enjoy! Had the best",
          "When in Rio this site is an absolute must visit. It\u2019s placed on one of the highest peaks around. The train ride to the summit is interesting itself. Plenty of flat space at the top to allow for many picture opportunities.",
          "A must-see, must-visit Rio attraction, it is definitely huge. Personally, I think this statue of Jesus is over-hyped. Okay, it's colossal, standing 98 feet high, and with arms spanning 92 feet. And yes, it is Rio's most recognizable landmark perched atop the 2,316-ft, Corcovado",
          "Both the Christ statue and the views are fascinating. It's one of the \"must do-s\" in Rio. Some tips to get the most of your visit: 1. Go early in the morning to avoid the crowd(at 9 am it was OK) 2. Check the weather forecast, and go on a clear, sunny day(if your schedule",
          "My family and I went, we took the train up the mountain on a rainy day, such beautiful sights of the city, definitely worth it",
          "The views and stature itself are amazing. It takes about 2-3 hours total getting up and down the mountain using the tram. It is mobbed with people so be prepared. It\u2019s a must see though.",
          "One of the new seven wonders in the world, you must see the statue and surrounding forest. It's Amazing!",
          "Good to attend, but book in advance for the train. Massive numerous groups of tourists attend. Except to queue up to 90 min if not booked. I would recommend the helicopter ride instead for a slightly more pricey view. Expect to climb steps to get to the main statue.",
          "You need a clear day to see anything. We went on one of the worst days possible - wet, foggy & cold. I can't say I enjoyed the lunch & so much time soent picking everyone up from hotels. Some people had been on the coach for over an hour before they got to us - we were then on",
          "We took the shuttle from Copacabana beach. This clean and HVAC shuttle brings you up to the loading area where you get transferred to the short shuttle to the statue. Very easy. One price covers everything. This was about a 20 minute slow walk from our hotel on the beach.",
          "The statue is HUGE. It was interesting to visit, but there were too many people there for my liking. (Do the Japanese really need 100 photos from every viewpoint?)",
          "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all been said but this is number one. Pre book the train tickets on line and grab a cab.",
          "Seeing the Christ the Redeemer statue is an awe-inspiring experience! Very busy sight but worth the train ride through the Tijuca Forest to see it.",
          "There can be long waits for the cog railway train to reach the top, but we were lucky on a Monday morning in early December. When you buy a ticket you are given a choice of train times. We chose the next available (11am). That time is actually the time the turnstile is opened",
          "Must go. Don\u2019t forget to book the train in advance as it can be crowded. The Swiss will feel kind of home. Don\u2019t miss the chapel under the Christ. Great view aro.",
          "This amazing venue is a must see for most tourists. We visited on a Sunday which was very busy. The viewpoints were extremely crowded with people taking numerous selfies and I wondered how many of them actually took the time to look at and appreciate the wonderful views and the",
          "It is an impressive statue and a must see when in Rio. I believe there is always a lot of people, but even so you can take nice pics. I recommend to visit with an organized group as the lines for individual people are very long and a guide will always have priority and tickets",
          "We booked an 8am shuttle and were able to enjoy the statue with just about 30-40 other people. By the time we left an hour later it was much more packed.",
          "We were on a cruise and looked forward to this activity. Took train up. Takes a while. We went on a Sunday morning. The view from the top is spectacular. I would highly recommend the visit.",

          "the place is great for views of course. our day coincided with 3 cruiseships which had preference for the train so.....no train. once at the top and having paid a van careful as there are touts charging again and they have the official tickets of the day. also this should be",
          "Amazing experience visiting this iconic location, I'm in awe of those who built this monument to faith. Worth the cost and faff of getting up there!",
          "You always think of this in Rio, it was a cloudy day so views were not the best but it was above the clouds so great photos",

          "There\u2019s not a massive amount to do at the top, except admire a massive statue, and some good views, and that makes it worth doing. It is very impressive. Top Tips: if you don\u2019t have time to buy an advance ticket go and try to buy one at the station. We got two tickets without",

          "This is obviously a must see in Rio, but I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed. For one, the statue was much smaller than I expected. Second, this is fairly obvious, but all the gorgeous views of the statue with the city and ocean in the background are taken from helicopters.",
          "The only one like it. Logistically a bit of a pain, with trains and lines of people, plus a million selfie takers with their arms spread. Still worth it.",
          "How could you not go if in Rio? If you cant get there early before the real crowds arrive then just be patient and allow enough time to enjoy it as much as you want. It is very busy understandably. I didnt like the fact that there were actually mats on the floor for people to",

          "Caution - if you go when cloudy, you will NOT see the city below, AND it\u2019s even hard to see detail in the Christ statue. I went when cloudy, and only a few times did the clouds briefly break for vistas of the city below. When the clouds broke, everyone scrambled to try and get",
          "The park is beautiful. There's an elevator almost all the way to Christ the Redeemer. There's an escalator but it was broken the day we were there so plan on doing some steps, but it really wasn't bad. I would also advise to go before 4 PM. Only because the sun gets behind",
          "I think that it doesn\u2019t matter at what time or what day out of the week you go because it will always be crowded. Great view! There\u2019s a place to eat just in case you get hungry. We decided to take the train option to the top rather than car which I highly recommend for the",
          "Was a rainy and foggy day, but that simply added to the visit. What a special moment to visit this beautiful landmark and wonder of the world!",
          "Spent the best part of half a day on logistics but ended up spending only half an hour at the statue itself. It's one of those places that you feel compelled to visit whilst in Rio, what with it being listed as one of the wonders of the modern world. It was for this reason alone",
          "Of course. This is THE icon of Rio. The train ride up is scenic and the views at the top are special. Well worth the trip up.",
          "The perfect representation of Rio. Majestic view from the top reached by a spiraling road. Incredible statue.",
          "We were lucky in a bad weather period to get a clear day which obviously makes a huge difference so don\u2019t book ahead but try to arrange to go on a good day. Also I gather we were lucky not to have long queues - we could go straight up and although it was busy st the top we had",
          "WOW. Simply amazing the magnitude of the statue and the views from the top. Go earlier to beat the crowds.",
          "OMG!! Easy to see why it\u2019s a constant on the wonders of the world list.unblievable takes your breath away.a must see.exceeds all expectations.lifelong memories made.",
          "It was raining but the top of the mountain stayed clean so we gave it a chance. As a result - stunning views with no queves and almost zero tourists. The clouds come and go so you have plenty of options for photos.",
          "Catch the train up the hill and then you walk the last bit. The shops are cheaper than the airport and have some nice stuff (and some tat). All are pretty much the same and equally priced. When you get up to Christ, you sit or stand on a marble floor about 10ft below his feet.",
          "View is good, but Jesus Christ come on when people tell you to move so they can get a photo. Mother of God, you don't own the bloody area mate.",
          "We came here as part of a tour so we were on our bus, got out, got tickets and boarded their vans for the ride to the top, I didnt enjoy it, its steep and fast. Out of the van and up the steps, quite a few steps and then the imposing statue of Christ. It was a foggy day so we",
          "Excellent, little bit expensive ticket but good, Make sure when sky are clear than go up hill Great fun sightseeing, Very scenic view, but when the sky is clear, the view is very attractive. So make sure that the sky is clear before getting tickets. A good place to visit with",
          "The statue itself is amazing and worth visiting by itself and well deserved to be 1/7 world wonders! Amazing views from the top!",
          "I visited this place not so much for the statue of Christ but for the spectacular views of Rio de Janeiro you have from the top.",
          "I took an Uber up there and was worth the trip. Lots of people, but efficient. You can't visit Rio without stopping here at least once in your life. Getting an Uber back you must be patient.",
          "You can\u2019t come to Rio and not see Christ the redeemer it\u2019s so apparent everywhere you turn in the city actually travelling up to it is a must. Amazing views of the city were hindered for us by cloud but when it broke it created a magical moment , we did it as part of a great",
          "One of the worlds great icons what more is there to say. Its one of the main reasons people go to Rio",
          "A trip to Rio is not complete without going to see Christ the Redeemer. I caught the shuttle from Copacabana and it was a very seamless experience. The shuttle cost63 Reals, which is great value. As it is is a confined space at the top the chances are there will be plenty of",
          "Had a great time even though it was misty and rainy . It was a great experience , will visit again when it\u2019s more sunny",
          "Went at 9.30am and it was quite busy then. And it is not even high season. We humm\u2019d and haa\u2019d about whether to go up because it was foggy, but we decided we had to, so didn\u2019t get the views of Rio, although we had seen some great ones from Sugarloaf Mountain. We were literally",
          "It gets crowded, pretty crowded so try to get there around 7am. The Christ Redeemer is such a big monument, you will inevitably get a good picture shot of it even when the place is swarming with people. Awesome views of Rio and many points of interest. Well worth the trip!",
          "Excellent This place is a wonderful heritage of humanity Christ r\u00e9demptor is so amazing A must for everyone coming to Rio",
          "We took a private tour from Copacabana to the entrance of the Christ the Redeemer. There are vans that take tourist up to the highest point since regular traffic is not allowed after the entrance gates. The ride in the van is included with the ticket. Once you reach the top, the",
          "It was ok but there are better views from nearby mountains. It took us about 1.5hr to get there from our hotel in Copacobana (including the tram ride and stair climb) and we spent only 20-30mins at the top.",
          "This attraction (along with Sugarloaf cable cars) was at the top of my list android not disappoint! A 'Must do' when in visiting Rio.",
          "We arrived early hoping to get on the tram but didn\u2019t realise that people who have booked on the internet get priority. So the wait would have been 2 hours. We decided to take a private car - so glad we did - it was perfect... we had a guide who provided us with information",
          "Amazing road to get up there and great views on a sunny day. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day but was enjoyable",
          "Absolutely incredible! A definite must to all visitors to Rio. Incredible structure and amazing views. Highly recommended.",
          "excellent coverage and Renata knows her subject. she introduces music to understand and appreciate Rio.",
          "Worth going, mostly for the view of the city. Must get tickets to go up- seems helpful for crowd control. But even so, be ready for lots of tourists!",
          "Great and terrific! We just fell in love with the entire view and specially its a great selfie place!",
          "There are two places you have to visit when in Rio: One is the famous \"Pao de A\u00e7ucar\", the other is the Corcovado with the famous \"Christ the Redeemer\" statue. You will enjoy the most stunning view from an inland peak towards the various parts of the city, the endless coastlines",
          "Decided against doing the traditional cable car/bus up and opted to hike via the botanical Gardens on the designated jungle/forest trek. Far more enjoyable for me and got to see monkeys, butterfly's, different ants and small harmless spiders. This trek is 7.5km up and is not for",
          "We had an absolutely amazing time touring the Christ th\u00e9 Redeemer statue! I can\u2019t wait to return with family and friends!",
          "Corcovado Christ the Redeemer is alway an impressive visit. I love the atmosphere around the statue with sightseeing places to take photographs of the city or the statue.",
          "This was an awesome experience BUT we had to walk up AND down a total of roughly 600 (yes six hundred) steps because the lift and escalator was out of service. There were a lot of people taking pictures and videos and it seems as if everyone enjoyed themselves and the view of",
          "I thank you for allowing me to explore this view, I think the bad thing is that sometimes it is difficult to get a good view due to the huge amount of people you can find but it is WORTH FOR THE PENALTY!",
          "The views from up here are a great started point of any tour in Rio. The crowds however are horrible! People lying of the floor to get that perfect pic! Rather than soaking up the sights!",
          "Amazing, unforgettable view of the Rio de Janeiro, you can get there by cable car only when the weather is good.. Strongly recommended",
          "What a great place to visit and admire the structure, and size and all the details...Its Brazilian style Welcome to ALL world!! Beautiful views all around.",
          "One can use the train to get to the top of the hill or one get there by car by road or one can even trek up the road to get to the top of the hill,the best way is to use the train where you can have a nice view of the forest and the panoramic view of the city as the train climbs",
          "What is there to say...you cannot visit Rio and not go to Corcovado! Fantastic views of the city and the iconic Rio photo op.",
          "Great views all over the city. Especially over Ipanema and the Laguna. Can definitely recommend to go early in order to avoid crowds",
          "Don\u2019 Take any organized tour, go by yourself. From the Copacabana are take the bus 583 who stops at the entrance to the train who takes you to the top of the Corcovado. Everybody speaks English and are very helpful. Spend the time you wish and return with the train back. The bus",
          "It is not so far from the city and it is worth to visit. Status is very tall and beautiful even at night. Moreover, you can see nice city view at this point.",
          "Seven hundred meters above the city - like a bird or even a drone. You will be seeing the hole Rio de Janeiro. Incredible.",
          "While the statue of Jesus is rather mediocre, the views from the top of the mountain are stunning and definitely worth it. If you can, go on a clear day, and you'll get the best possible views.",
          "This World Heritage site on Cocarvado Mountain is a must see. A number of ways to get there, Uber, public bus or the official vans that take you from varios points in the city. We took the van, you pay axset price and get taken right to entrance. Well organised, well maintsined",
          "It was such an amazing experience. Just the weather didnt play a part.views were limited due to mist. Otherwise it was great. Shop had beautiful souvenirs.",
          "The monument is very safe and clean People are nice, snack places are reasonable and souvenirs are not expensive",
          "Your really up there in the clouds. If your in Rio, Christ the Redeemer has to be #1 on your list to see.",
          "We took an early morning 'skip the line' tour to Visit Christ the Redeemer and would highly recommend visiting early. We arrived and had photos and time to check out the view before the crowds started arriving. The statue is just amazing and even beyond what I had expected.",
          "We had an uber to the tram station. Arrive early!! It will be crowded! Taxi drivers and other non staff will try to get you in a taxi to bring you up to the statue. Just wait and get in line. Inside out of shade after buying your ticket. Ones up. There will be people, and you",
          "You get a really cool overview of the entire city. Pretty cool to see how big Rio is. We took the train up which I thought was cool. It was crowded but it is the #1 attraction.",
          "We visited as part of an organised tour initially however the weather was not great with very low cloud covering the statue. The tajica forest however was still lovely... The 2nd visit we just went & bought our tix direct from the sales office on boardwalk...much cheaper &",
          "A very hilarious spectacle to be sure: dozens of tourists with their hands spread out and their spouses and friends lying with their backs on the ground trying to capture them and the huge statue. Other than that the statue, unbeknownst to most, has a church on its base with",
          "This was the main reason for my trip to Rio. It did not disappoint. It was a cloudy rainy day, but it was still beautiful. Great views of Rio and all the surrounding area. I was in awe. Definitely recommend.",
          "If you are going to visit Rio, you must visit the \u201cCristo Redentor\u201d. Besides being the symbol of the city, the statue is one of the most important Christian sign in the world. Everyday Corcovado is full of tourists from around the world. In my opinion, you should buy the",
          "We were on the 9am train, which was quiet. When we returned at 10.30/11, the station was heaving, despite being off season. Amazing views, reasonable facilities, but more importantly, Wonder bagged!",
          "We came for the view mainly. But the Christ sculpture is really something, breathtaking, inspiring and different. A nice and positive energy there. The security guards spend most of their time taking pictures of the visitors, nice atmosphere! We went up in the morning before",
          "Very spectacular and a must see. Amazing when you get up close to it. We got the first train which was perfect, it got really crowded within half an hour of being up there. Crowds are crazy all trying to get the best selfie without anyone being in their picture (not possible)",
          "Exciting to be here but I did find the behaviour of some of the tourists obnoxious. I would recommend going in the morning as by 3pm the sun was not on Christ\u2019s face. The train is slow but it\u2019s all part of the experience.",
          "It was amazing time in Brazil! Rio De Janeiro always interesting and attractive ! Magic and Beautiful!!!",
          "It\u2019s a big montain, excelent view, you need to go. Rio de Janeiro : we love you! Next time I will stay more time, the sunset",
          "The statue is visible all over Rio but seeing it up close is quite breathtaking. The journey provides great views too, particularly on the right side downward-facing seats. Of course it's very busy which means long lines of people for the journeys up and down but also the area",
          "Fairly long queues, although once you are up there the views are really nice. Another must see when in Rio, although I wouldn't bother with the restaurants",
          "You've seen photos or you've seen it on tv, however nothing compares to actually being there and the story behind it. We went as part of a tour and it was amazing. We are not religious at all, it was the story, the engineering feat and the stunning views that we enjoyed and",
          "It is not necessary to arrange a tour here. Buy your tickets online or at the Trem do Corcovado station (I believe they\u2019re cheaper at the self service points than the ticket office windows - we paid about GBP50 for 3 of us). You can choose the time of your train and wait in the",
          "I\u2019ve been dreaming to visit Rio since i was a little. Being here is surreal experience. Charming place definitely recommended.",
          "This is the iconic landmark of Rio. It is very very very worth the wait and the train ride to the top. Most beautiful view of entire Rio. Even if you are not religious, this is a spiritual event to see. We waited for four days to go because of rain. Once the weather cleared, we",
          "Go early to avoid huge crowds was great advice. Definitely worth the trip to experience the views and the Christ the Redeemer photo opportunity. Well maintained and immaculately presented. Fantastic experience",
          "The weather was shocking so literally couldn\u2019t see a thing but the statue was smaller than expected and the shop at the van level were well shocked with good customer service.",
          "I recently went to the Corcovado and met the man. The place is super hyped and lot of tourist tout. The tourist traps are everywhere. Lots of things are not what as advertised. The taxi driver wanted us to drop at the train station despite us booking the taxi to to the top. As",
          "To start, please be careful when you arrive at the Christ the redeemed train station as you will be inundated with young brazilian men offering to help relieve you of cash. But don't let this put you off, it's so well organised you can and should do it alone. For me the best way",
          "Went with friends and every view was spectacular. Took trolley ride up. Shrine at base of Christ the Redeemer statute.",
          "Went early in the morning before 8am and there were already long queue. Queued for 20mins just to be informed that the cogwheel train broke down and they suggest us to go on our own. Decided to take a taxi up to the station and managed to book the earliest slot to christ",
          "Make sure you go on the cogwheel train to the top. Once there you climb steps to the top (elevator available) and the whole thing is just stunning and awe inspiring.",
          "A must go place in Rio. Be prepared for awesome views (in nice weather) and lots of crowd to go with it. If you don't want to break the bank, get Uber to the Visitor Center, and just pay for the tickets to go up the statue.",
          "fantastic expereince, it is one of the must of Rio de janeiro, it is the most famous symbol of Brasil",
          "You need to book in advance or it will be impossible to see. We chose the Corcovado Train experience and it is fun. However, once you arrive near the Statue of Cristo Redentor it's very chaotic. There are too many people, it's almost impossible to walk and it's impossible to",
          "The views were spectacular once you reached the top, however, it was very busy, lots of people, it was hard to avoid not bumping into anyone, lots of people were taking pictures. First, you have to purchase your tickets before getting access to where the shuttle train is.",
          "This most iconic symbol of Rio is also one of the modern 7 wonders of the world. From there one get the best view of the city overlooking the Sugar Loaf, beaches and more. From my experience as a traveler who\u2019s been to many major attractions in the world from Asia to Europe and",
          "The views are AMAZING- the best of all in town, but it\u2019s hard to avoid the crowds and long queues. If I were to do it again I would definately NOT take the van from the city all the way up to the top and back... 1. We didn\u2019t save much time- first we had to wait 30 mins for the",
          "How can you miss one of the seven wonders of the world? Don\u2019t go when it\u2019s cloudy. You first take the metro to Largo do Machado, and right outside, there is a bus to Cosme Velho, the bus will stop right in front of the train station that goes up to the Christ",
          "You can get there by taxi or you can get there by funicular railway, which is cheap and very scenic as you go through scrubland and houses. It The view really is breathtaking, all of Rio on view and Sugarloaf Mtn, beaches harbour, you can see some of the port defences too.",
          "the redeemer is great, blessing all of us. The view is fantastic, the best of Rio de Janeiro. I recommend to go up by train",
          "One must see this unique landmark of Rio. It is amazingly spectacular!!! It helps to have a guide but it can be done on your own.",
          "Instead of a religious symbol overlooking Rio it is an overcrowded and overrated tourist trap. Only worth the visit is you are intent on getting a \"selfie\" which seemed to be the main reason for everyone's visit. There are great views from the top but there are also great views",
          "Hard to climb but perfect view. There are nice cafes. But it is so sunny. Dont forget ur cap and sunglass!",
          "First day in Rio and we had to make a definite stop at Christ the redeemer, it was not as packed as we would have expected which was great, lines moved quickly great views and it was still sunny so enjoyable trip. Good wifi reception as well.",
          "Ride up high into the clouds flying over the famous \"favelas\" to the well known Christ that seems to embrace humanity. It is just like the Eiffel Tower,Brooklyn Bridge,the Pyramids,Brandenburg Gate Charles Bridge or any of the other most famous landmarks. Be ready to fight the",
          "There is a reason everyone visits the Cristo..because it's an iconic landmark and the views are amazing! The train ride up the mountain to get to the statue is really cool in its own right. The views are incredible and vastly different perspective than that of Sugar Loaf. Get",
          "The views are pretty and it\u2019s worth going to once. The reason every photo is at a steep upwards angle is because there are so many people there it\u2019s the only way to not have strangers in your photo. Try to go early or late.",
          "Going there will take you an hour or more but thats ok, you can feel the majestic view of the Christ Redeemer. What I dont like was theres theis Local Travel Guide that cuts in the line and he was really arrogant. Anyway, but thats the bad side of it. The good side is the",
          "This is one of the things that you CANT miss, if you visit Rio. There are two options two get there, by van or train. Train is the most beautiful way because it lets you appreciate the view of the mountains and it\u2019s more fun. You need to get to the Cosme Velho station (by",
          "This was our fourth trip visiting and the experience is always great. From the train ride up to the spectacular views, it is always worth the time. Visitors are always amazed at the sheer size and magnitude.",
          "Amazing place, must visit on your list! You can go on foot, but be careful- Rio is not safe, it\u2019s better to walk in a group.",
          "Great time, a guide like Gustavo really makes it easy to see the top spots, like the chapel, Christ the Redeemer, and seeing the beautiful country side, the favelas and the beaches. My wife is still talking about it!",
          "The short tram journey & then a short hike led to an amazing view of Christ the Redeemer. Great sea views from the top. Very serene. Went in July when it was a little less crowded but the weather was terrific.",
          "When you there it is breathtakingly beautiful with amazing scenic views. The only downside for me was the chaotic getting there was, we opted for the minibus which took us part of the way with a brief stop for a photo opportunity. We then got dropped off and it was so confusing",
          "Known all around the world. Very busy tourist atraction. We used a local tour guide and it really helped. You need to go to a main station near the statue and from there you will need a mini-bus that will take you to the statue area from where you can take an elevator. When we",
          "We visited Christ the Redeemer as I wish to see all 7 new wonders of the world. This place is so disappointing, so busy, such a let down. We were told to get the tram up, and to sit on the right hand side for epic views... we must have seen three seconds of view on the way up.",
          "Brazil is kind of scary regardless of what people say lol so BE CAREFUL and try to go with someone who knows it well, speaks portugese or lives there(or all 3.) ANYWAY, the Christo as they call it there, is WAY bigger than I anticipated and also can be easily hiked to. They",
          "Even if you aren\u2019t religious, this is worth seeing. There\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s a modern wonder of the world. We booked our tram tickets the day before online. The weather was perfect, so we had no trouble. We went on the 10am tram and were down the hill at noon. Yes, it was",
          "One of the few places in the world if you can you have to visit. We did as a tour, picked up and returned to the hotel. Not overly expensive. It is very busy, so for that perfect photo you will have to be patient and tolerant. Views from up there staggering",
          "This is another MUST SEE tourist spot in Rio. Get there early because the crowds can be huge. You start off boarding a funicular railway car. There are crowds so be ready. Book online. I have said it in other reviews but any popular tourist sights will require a ticket and",
          "Neither the escalators nor lifts were working so for those of us with mobility problems this wasn\u2019t good. It seemed badly organised and somewhat scruffy given the thousands of people that go through every day. The area for the cog train was completely overcrowded and they missed",
          "Nice ride up on the funicular train. Interesting views. Very Instagrammable, I guess. But disappointing that there wasn't something to explain how it came to be, and why. Overall, a bit 'Meh'!",
          "Everything is very well organised but its very busy. However, the view of the city hs great and worth the crowds.",
          "My young adult son took me to Brazil for my birthday. (Did not have option to put this on what sort of visit this was.) He has been to Brazil several times and speaks Portuguese fluently. This was my first time. Our 2nd day in Rio, we went to Christ the Redeemer. They have",

          "While we were in Buenos Aries, we had booked a private two day tour. The first day we went to neighbouring districts and saw sights off the beaten track. It was a Saturday and there were five cruise ships in port. Our said it would better to save this sight for the next day. We",
          "Although it is a very crowded place, it is definitely worth a visit. Go in the morning, so the light is good for pictures. Otherwise, Christ\u2019s face is in the shadow.",

          "Visited on a Sunday morning in mid June, beautiful weather so excellent views all round and perfect for the iconic shot with statue in background. The escalator was out of order but just took the steps gently, luckily was not too overcrowded. Loved the cog train ride up and down.",
          "Said to be one of the wonders of the world. Be prepared to walk up 200+ stairs to see one awesome view of the city of Rio! Huge statue of Christ!",
          "If you are in Rio this is a must see, but the cloudscape can make or break it. It was mostly cloudy when we were there, so we could only capture glimpses of Christ's head, and could not really see Rio itself until the decent It was busy - and this was a Monday in Winter - so",
          "It was quite an amazing experience to have seen this. The cab was able to drive us so far, and you have to hike the remainder, which is also filled with breath taking views of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Anyone who visits Rio has to visit this!",
          "You will not be disappointed by the ride to the top, and the incredible 360 degree views. It's a must do when in Rio",

          "We visited on a tour and on a beautiful day. Great views over Sugar Loaf, Copacabana Beach and across Rio. Spoiled somewhat by the large number of people with no consideration for others. Try and choose a quiet time for your visit. This was the second time we\u2019d visited and",

          "Absolutely amazing place! The Christ statue is by itself amazing but also the view over Rio de Janeiro is amazing to watch. Come on a clear day and you'll see the whole city. The tram up goes through the forest and is nice to do.",

          "Nothing much to see here. Lots of people. On a sunny day, you can't get a great photo of yourself or the statue. Not sure if You could do the hike solo, it appears you could do it safely. Its great work for sure. If you are paying more than 65 Rs you are paying too much (just fyi)",
          "Went on a cloudy/foggy day, which was a different look than the postcards provide. Still impressive, but would recommend going on a clearer day as I feel we really missed out on the view of Rio.",
          "Well worth the trek to see this. Hordes of tourists and watch out for all the selfie sticks.",
          "this is awesome i wish i could go too but sadly i'm only 11 and not an adult",

          "Very beutifull place but its very high",
          "Amazing view!! If you get help from tourist guides you can make it up there in less than an hour. If not it will probably take 4 or 5 hours( without reservation) . I didn't do any reservations online cause I didn't know it was possible! ( GET RESERVATIONS ONLINE AND YOU WILL THANK ME LATER)",
          "Nice views of the city if you're lucky with the weather (unlike me). The enormous queues make it seem overrated.",

          "The first time I cried like a baby because I was afraid of heights. But I recommend it even if you're afraid because the view is totally worth it.\n\nThis second time I spent more time up there appreciating the Christ statue. The fear was \u2026",
          "Very busy but still impressive and worth seeing. We got a van up, but there is a half way point where you have to get out and have a picture taken which they try to sell you at the end.",
          "Amazing view of R\u00edo from all angles. However it's a very popular destination so there always a bunch of tourists bound to be in your shot. Usually a bunch of people waiting to get the best balcony photo view so allow yourself time to wait \u2026",

          "A classic, and must-see when you come to Rio. The train ride to the top is a part of this experience that I really was surprised to enjoy. The ride takes you through a national park, filled with large trees and dense vegetation.\nThe statue \u2026",
          "Obviously must see place in Rio. Its a remarkable landscape that you can enjoy only in few places in the world. But IMHO is it's not a wonder of world. Anyway they have recently upgrade new train system and its running every 20 mins in busy hours and every 30 mins off peak hours.",
          "I have to give the 5 star to this wonder of our planet. The statue is beautiful it gives you a special feeling when you see it. The views? Breathtaking. It\u2019s a must in your life.\nThe negatives bits super crowded no matter what time you\u2019re \u2026",
          "Just one word..... breathtaking \u2764 but you have to go early....",

          "Lugar bem bonito.  Fantastic!!!  Great day trip.  Wonderful climb with a rewarding view of a marvelous city.  This place is busy and sunny.  If you have health limitations, you may think twice about the climb.  Bring plenty of water when it\u2019s hot.  All is worth it though. Eu amei este lugar.",

          "Totally overrated.  If you want to be encompassed with 10,000+ people head straight here.  If not enjoy from a distance.",
          "Amazing... Too many people. 46 Reales per person",
          "A must-see wonder, always full of people, so one needs to figure out a way to enjoy the views despite that. You'll probably be queuing up to get the best spot for a quick peek or click, but its all worth it, after all, thats is why you are there. Avoid rush hours or seasons to be just a little better off.",
          "Great experience with fantastic views of Rio! \n\nGo early to avoid as much of the crowds as possible especially if you want to get that IG / FB shot of you with Christ the Redeemer. \n\nYou can pay to ride the train up but it's not worth the \u2026",
          "I am sure, every tourist - private or business - coming to Rio de Janeiro is going to get up to the Jesus Christ Statue. And rightfully so. It is a wonderful location with breathtaking views in all direction- It also features small chapel and a food area for the exhausted travelers ;-) \n\nEnjoy it, especially in dawn!",
          "Sick absolutely amazing \n\nThe train is ok, the walk up the steps builds the tension then you see the man himself \n\nAmazing experience a bit crowded but that's fine everybody is nice and mindful \n\nGood experience",
          "A fascinating view  ... definitely a once in a life time awesome experience .!!!!",
          "A wonder, simply stunning views over the city and such a great experience, the tram is brand new and great journey",
          "It's certainly about the view from the top rather than the statue itself. Maybe it's the fact it's so famous and so seen, that it's smaller than expected size, made it a little underwhelming. But it's certainly worth the trip up for the \u2026",
          "Amazing! A must if you go to Rio",
          "Amazing place ..it's the one of beautiful view of the world...",
          "Amazing place and feeling but sadly it was raining and very foggy.",
          "This is definitely an awesome place to hang out and get a very good overlook over Rio. Of course there are a lot of people and the statue itself isn\u2019t that interesting. But as I mentioned, the view will do the job. Actually you probably \u2026",
          "Awesome i love it too much....",
          "Finally I came face to face with Christ the redeemer! This was an emotional moment for me as I'd always dreamt of going to see it. It sure did live up to my expectations! I just wish I wasn't part of a tour group so I could have spent \u2026",

          "If you are gonna walk up from Parque Lage it's gonna take you a min of 2.5hours and there are some intense steep hills, so much fun afterwards but quite torturous during",
          "The statue of Christ the Redeemer would seem much more impressive if there weren't as many people posing like the statue does at all hours of the day. We took the tram up Corcovado and the ride is quaint and a fun experience. Peak hours \u2026",
          "Great to see Big Jesus in person. Im going  to be back with family next time.",

          "The ride to this place itself was too good and the christ statue is so miraculous. We felt blessed to be there and you can take photos of your lifetime up there. It has the most beautiful view of the city of Rio de Jeneiro and is rated the top most tourist spot in TripAdvisor.",
          "Great, but go very early as it becomes super crazy.",
          "Jesus Christ!\nTake a poncho it could rain at any minute. Also must take the train it is a wonderful scary experience. Remember to take lots of pictures. There is a small grill or Cafe at the top. For Americans hamburgers are not hamburgers.",
          "This experience was awesome and a must stop in Rio. The most important thing to check before going is to make sure it\u2019s sunny or at least it\u2019s not too cloudy. Otherwise, it will be useless to go up if it is too cloudy. Also, expect to have \u2026",

          "It is a must go. Unforgettable. But one must choose the right day and time to enjoy it. I recommend a weekday and no late than mid morning. To avoid the crowds. Some luck is also required. A clear day is mandatory.",
          "Excelent experience! Mandatory if you come to Rio.",
          "A don't miss location in Rio. Make sure to go before noon or the sun will be behind Jesus, which makes photos much harder to take with all the tourists packed in the shade of the statue, trying to get their shots. Speaking of tourists, \u2026",

          "Being one of the seven wonders of the world is reason enough to enjoy this beautiful work of art. Once you reach the summit after taking a two car train, there's still a large number of steps to get to the statue. From there the 360 Vista \u2026",

          "Wonderful place. The Christ Redeemer itself is amazing (awed by the size of it) but the view from the top of the mountain is unbelievable especially when the weather is nice. You could take a tram, bus or even take a walk.",

          "Amazing view, was cloudy at first but it cleared up alot after like 15mins",
          "Incredible experience to be lived at least once in a lifetime... The installation is very clean, there was always security personnel around, the price was acceptable but I would reinforce security by the very entrance due to scammers and resellers at the entry point which may lead to several tourists falling into traps and scams.",
          "Too many tourist overrated.",
          "This place is must visit if you come to Rio but your experience depends on weather chose a sunny or at least cloud free day to visit if possible. I can\u2019t commit about the 360 views because it\u2019s was cloudy so didn\u2019t get to enjoy the views",

          "The statute is perfectly made, the view is unique but the touristic services must be improved. Be aware of the guys presenting themselves as guides with badges hanging on their necks. You can easily win the tour yourselves unless otherwise you are looking for a professional guide and for that; it is not a big deal.",
          "This iconic attraction is truly all that it is hyped up to be and more. Just being up there is incredible because you are above the clouds (maybe bring a jacket if you don't like the cold) and then the statue itself just put me in awe as if it was not man-made. I could not describe it.",
          "What\u2019s better than seeing the statue itself is the dramatic views of the city of Rio from the top.  Going up by bus was quick and without hassle from Botafogo station.  It was quite easy to get a bus up (you need to change tickets halfway) but the top was crowded so be prepared to jostle to get the insta perfect view.",
          "Unbeatable views ! Iconic location.",
          "The most iconic place to visit in Rio de Janeiro but unfortunately way too much touristed. It were nearly impossible to take any photos of the statue and just to walk around up there. I went on a Saturday and that\u2019s maybe the problem.\n\nI \u2026",

          "Really cool place. Very touristy and busy and honestly I don't think it's worthy of one of the wonders of the world (up close); but it's a nice thing to soon and not super expensive. Be careful coming back as taxis and rides are harder to \u2026",
          "It's a mind-blowing attractions that made me fly for 17 hours just to see. I turned out that's is more than what I expected. Amazing place that makes you feel happy. It's very high and literally you can see whole Rio. You need to plan your \u2026",
          "I just love it",
          "Although it was misty, there was brief seconds when we could see the statue. Drive to top is great.",
          "Iconic. A no doubt cool experience, however extremely crowded. Like barely enough room to stand crowded. Everyone is trying to get their selfies for Instagram and you can barely fit in. I enjoyed the train ride up and the views of the city \u2026",
          "Out of this world but very busy",
          "Get the cable cart up, it's not expensive. Otherwise it's dangerous, there was favelas at the foot of the mountain. The cable cart is a great way to see some of the forest on the way to the summit also. The statue itself can get busy, and \u2026",
          "Worth a visit. The view is nice but expect a lot of people in a small space. It's particularly crowded on weekends and getting there with the buss system is a bit strange as they make you take 2 different busses so you're on and off these 4 \u2026",
          "Too much people. Extremely crowdy.",
          "I can't believe Jesus is t-posing over all of us smh",
          "Disappointed at first for visiting on a cloudy day, it turned out to be a very mystic experience thanks to perfect combination of clouds and sun.",
          "The symbol of South America. The third marvelous of the modern world. The biggest sculpture Art Deco of the modern world! Would you like to know more? Call me, a tour guide in Rio!",

          "Definitely the best tourist attraction in Rio, very well organised. Suggest getting train and sit on the side face downhill as you get better views. Buy your tickets online and in advance so you can get there earlier as the morning ones go \u2026",
          "Speechless views, The iconic Statue of Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor) sits atop Corcovado Mountain at 2,300 feet (700 meters) above the city and it keep a watchful eye over the people of Rio de Janeiro. This amazing statue was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.",
          "Took a taxi and the bus to the top had a combination of views, clear, partly cloudy.",
          "Must visit place!\nStunning panorama and Christ!",
          "Buy your tickets online first, take an Uber there and avoid midday when it is hottest and most people are there. Be prepared for huge crowds, and high priced trinkets.  The clouds blow through quickly which gives it a sense of unreality. \u2026",
          "It's well maintained. Easy to go to. However, it could use a direction at the bottom where Uber cars normally drop off their passengers. I had to follow the crowd to find it. This is one of the wonders of the world. If you're into that stuff, go!",
          "Excellent space, tours are well organised, easy to access, it is very busy up at the christ as expected.\nGift shop looks great, and nice exhibition for free at the centre.\nNo phone signal up there FYI",
          "Best place to visit, I highly recommend this place.",
          "one of the best place to visit...",
          "Absolutely stunning views in every direction. Accesible by busses or a railcart. Usually it's very busy and cramped with people so try to get there as soon as possible.",
          "Beautiful . A must visit place. Look at forecast of weather before visit",
          "You get great views of the city from this high up in the mountains. It's definitely not the easiest of places to get to, so plan ahead and get to the train/tram station that takes you straight here ... it's about R$65 return...and get there early to be able to take great photos, as it's not very well lit when the sun set.",
          "One thing off my bucket list! Second best view in Rio. First being Sugar loaf mountain.",
          "Visited twice.. A great place.. First the marvellous Christ the Redeemer statue.. It has been wonderfully sculpted and no wonder it's termed an engineering marvel too... \nAccess is by road taking the tour vans that could cost 62rials.. Or \u2026",
          "Incredible view of the city from here. We went around noon (by the time we got up there) and it was packed. Barely room to get around and take a good photo. With the height of the monument, though, getting a photo wasn't difficult. \n\nWe \u2026",
          "I want to visit this place one day.",

          "It's a place that's mandatory if you come to Rio. You hace two options to get to the top, v\u00eda train ir treeking, I choose the treeking and ir was great",
          "Don't forget to visit the small chapel behind the huge statue.  The views are amazing and it's one of those spiritual moments, definitely worth a visit in my opinion.",
          "Most Magical moment ever.",
          "Visited on a Monday around 12 o\u2019clock. Very very busy. More could be done to regulate the crowds there. Visited on a cloudy day, was clear when we left, but not the best view when we got there. Still good though, and would def recommend. \u2026",
          "What an experience. We took the hardest way up which was the hour and a half hike through the forest and up the mountain to get there. Almost got bit by a cobra after it fell out of a tree in front of our group, ran out of of water, and \u2026",
          "Worth the trip up the cable car.",
          "Rio De Janeiro the city full of lovely people, beautiful beaches , both natural, man made and human beauty , everyone here seems so fitness enthusiast, Christ the Redeemer tour is a must especially by that tram .. lovely scenes on the way \u2026",

          "Difficult to walk around when it's too full, but absolutely worth a visit!\nIt's easy to get pictures once you're up there, but do be careful with your bags.",
          "You have to see it. The train ride up the mountain is another experience on its own.",
          "One of the landmarks of Rio. Well worth the trip to get there. The original train line is still operating and probably the best way to enjoy the climb",
          "Very impressive. I would strongly suggest to arrive very early in the morning, around 8 as it gets very very crowded.",
          "never been here but i think it's cool.",

          "One of the must see sights in Rio. Great fun cable car and even if it's busy up top the views are outstanding",
          "The walk to the top is worth it, and safe - we did the walk today, on a Sunday and passed at least 30 people going up and down. It took 1.5hrs to get to the top, but it made getting to the top all the more rewarding. Entry is $R28 per person. Lots of people at the top, trying to get the best shot, which is a bit frustrating.",

        "wiki": "Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: [\u02c8\u025bts\u00f5 (w)\u0250\u02c8\u027e\u0250\u0303t\u0283iz du n\u0250si\u02c8m\u1ebdtu]; born 23 October 1940), known as Pel\u00e9 ([pe\u02c8l\u025b]), is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played as a forward. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century award. That same year, Pel\u00e9 was elected Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee. According to the IFFHS, Pel\u00e9 is the most successful domestic league goal-scorer in football history scoring 650 goals in 694 League matches, and in total 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial friendlies and is a Guinness World Record. During his playing days, Pel\u00e9 was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world.\nPel\u00e9 began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, being the only player ever to do so. Pel\u00e9 is the all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games. At club level he is the record goalscorer for Santos, and led them to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores. Known for connecting the phrase \"The Beautiful Game\" with football, Pel\u00e9's \"electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals\" made him a star around the world, and his teams toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity. Since retiring in 1977, Pel\u00e9 has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the Honorary President of the New York Cosmos.\nAveraging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pel\u00e9 was adept at striking the ball with either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents' movements on the field. While predominantly a striker, he could also drop deep and take on a playmaking role, providing assists with his vision and passing ability, and he would also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pel\u00e9 received several individual and team awards for his performance in the field, his record-breaking achievements, and legacy in the sport.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\nPel\u00e9 was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940, in Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born Jo\u00e3o Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American inventor Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the \"i\" and call him \"Edson\", but there was a mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as \"Edison\", not \"Edson\", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed \"Dico\" by his family. He received the nickname \"Pel\u00e9\" during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bil\u00e9, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pel\u00e9 stated he had no idea what the name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bil\u00e9, and that it is Hebrew for \"miracle\" (\u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05ab\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0), the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.Pel\u00e9 grew up in poverty in Bauru in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. He earned extra money by working in tea shops as a servant. Taught to play by his father, he could not afford a proper football and usually played with either a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with a string or a grapefruit. He played for several amateur teams in his youth, including Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, S\u00e3o Paulinho, and Am\u00e9riquinha. Pel\u00e9 led Bauru Athletic Club juniors (coached by Waldemar de Brito) to two S\u00e3o Paulo state youth championships. In his mid-teens, he played for an indoor football team called Radium. Indoor football had just become popular in Bauru when Pel\u00e9 began playing it. He was part of the first Futebol de Sal\u00e3o (indoor football) competition in the region. Pel\u00e9 and his team won the first championship and several others.According to Pel\u00e9, indoor football presented difficult challenges; he said it was a lot quicker than football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pel\u00e9 accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14 years old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. \"That gave me a lot of confidence\", Pel\u00e9 said, \"I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come\".\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Santos ===\n\nIn 1956, de Brito took Pel\u00e9 to Santos, an industrial and port city located near S\u00e3o Paulo, to try out for professional club Santos FC, telling the directors at Santos that the 15-year-old would be \"the greatest football player in the world.\" Pel\u00e9 impressed Santos coach Lula during his trial at the Est\u00e1dio Vila Belmiro, and he signed a professional contract with the club in June 1956. Pel\u00e9 was highly promoted in the local media as a future superstar. He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the age of 15 against Corinthians Santo Andre and had an impressive performance in a 7\u20131 victory, scoring the first goal in his prolific career during the match.When the 1957 season started, Pel\u00e9 was given a starting place in the first team and, at the age of 16, became the top scorer in the league. Ten months after signing professionally, the teenager was called up to the Brazil national team. After the 1958 and the 1962 World Cup, wealthy European clubs, such as Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester United, tried to sign him in vain; in 1958 Inter Milan even managed to get him a regular contract, but Angelo Moratti was forced to tear the contract up at the request of Santos' chairman following a revolt by Santos' Brazilian fans. However, in 1961 the government of Brazil under President J\u00e2nio Quadros declared Pel\u00e9 an \"official national treasure\" to prevent him from being transferred out of the country.\n\nPel\u00e9 won his first major title with Santos in 1958 as the team won the Campeonato Paulista; Pel\u00e9 would finish the tournament as top scorer with 58 goals, a record that stands today. A year later, he would help the team earn their first victory in the Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo with a 3\u20130 over Vasco da Gama. However, Santos was unable to retain the Paulista title. In 1960, Pel\u00e9 scored 33 goals to help his team regain the Campeonato Paulista trophy but lost out on the Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo tournament after finishing in 8th place. In the 1960 season, Pel\u00e9 scored 47 goals and helped Santos regain the Campeonato Paulista. The club went on to win the Ta\u00e7a Brasil that same year, beating Bahia in the finals; Pel\u00e9 finished as top scorer of the tournament with 9 goals. The victory allowed Santos to participate in the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club tournament in the Western hemisphere.\n\nSantos's most successful Copa Libertadores season started in 1962;  the team was seeded in Group One alongside Cerro Porte\u00f1o and Deportivo Municipal Bolivia, winning every match of their group but one (a 1\u20131 away tie versus Cerro). Santos defeated Universidad Cat\u00f3lica in the semi-finals and met defending champions Pe\u00f1arol in the finals. Pel\u00e9 scored twice in the playoff match to secure the first title for a Brazilian club. Pel\u00e9 finished as the second top scorer of the competition with four goals. That same year, Santos would successfully defend the Campeonato Brasileiro (with 37 goals from Pel\u00e9) and the Ta\u00e7a Brasil (Pel\u00e9 scoring four goals in the final series against Botafogo). Santos would also win the 1962 Intercontinental Cup against Benfica. Wearing his number 10 shirt, Pel\u00e9 produced one of the best performances of his career, scoring a hat-trick in Lisbon as Santos won 5\u20132. \nAs the defending champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semi-final stage of the 1963 Copa Libertadores. The ballet blanco, the nickname given to Santos for Pel\u00e9, managed to retain the title after victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. Pel\u00e9 helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that contained Brazilian legends such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with a last-minute goal in the first leg of the semi-finals which made it 1\u20131. In the second leg, Pel\u00e9 scored a hat-trick in the Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3 as Santos won, 0\u20134, in the second leg. Santos started the final series by winning, 3\u20132, in the first leg and defeating Boca Juniors 1\u20132, in La Bombonera. It was a rare feat in official competitions, with another goal from Pel\u00e9. Santos became the first (and to date the only) Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pel\u00e9 finished the tournament with 5 goals. Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third place but went on to win the Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo tournament after a 0\u20133 win over Flamengo in the final, with Pel\u00e9 scoring one goal. Pel\u00e9 would also help Santos retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Ta\u00e7a Brasil against Milan and Bahia respectively.\n\nIn the 1964 Copa Libertadores, Santos were beaten in both legs of the semi-finals by Independiente. The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pel\u00e9 netting 34 goals. Santos also shared the Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Ta\u00e7a Brasil for the fourth consecutive year. In the 1965 Copa Libertadores, Santos reached the semi-finals and met Pe\u00f1arol in a rematch of the 1962 final. After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie. Unlike 1962, Pe\u00f1arol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2\u20131. Pel\u00e9 would, however, finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals. This proved to be the start of a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1966, Pel\u00e9 and Santos also failed to retain the Ta\u00e7a Brasil as Pel\u00e9's goals were not enough to prevent a 9\u20134 defeat by Cruzeiro (led by Tost\u00e3o) in the final series. The club did, however, win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pel\u00e9 scored his 1000th goal in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil. The goal, popularly dubbed O Mil\u00e9simo (The Thousandth), occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama, when Pel\u00e9 scored from a penalty kick, at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium.Pel\u00e9 states that his most memorable goal was scored at Rua Javari stadium on a Campeonato Paulista match against S\u00e3o Paulo rival Clube Atl\u00e9tico Juventus on 2 August 1959. As there is no video footage of this match, Pel\u00e9 asked that a computer animation be made of this specific goal. In March 1961, Pel\u00e9 scored the gol de placa (goal worthy of a plaque), against Fluminense at the Maracan\u00e3. Pel\u00e9 received the ball on the edge of his own penalty area, and ran the length of the field, eluding opposition players with feints, before striking the ball beyond the goalkeeper. A plaque was commissioned with a dedication to \"the most beautiful goal in the history of the Maracan\u00e3\".In 1967, the two factions involved in the Nigerian Civil War agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire so they could watch Pel\u00e9 play an exhibition game in Lagos. During his time at Santos, Pel\u00e9 played alongside many gifted players, including Zito, Pepe, and Coutinho; the latter partnered him in numerous one-two plays, attacks, and goals.\n\n\n=== New York Cosmos ===\n\nAfter the 1974 season (his 19th with Santos), Pel\u00e9 retired from Brazilian club football although he continued to occasionally play for Santos in official competitive matches. Two years later, he came out of semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. Though well past his prime at this point, Pel\u00e9 was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the United States. During his first public appearance in Boston, he was injured by a crowd of fans who had surrounded him and was evacuated on a stretcher. Pel\u00e9 made his debut for the Cosmos on 15 June 1975 against the Dallas Tornado at Downing Stadium, scoring one goal in a 2\u20132 draw.\n\nIn 1975, one week before the Lebanese Civil War, Pel\u00e9 played a friendly game for the Lebanese club Nejmeh against a team of Lebanese Premier League stars, scoring two goals which were not included in his official tally. On the day of the game, 40,000 spectators were at the stadium from early morning to watch the match.Hoping to fuel the same kind of awareness in the Dominican Republic, he and the Cosmos team played in an exhibition match against Haitian team, Violette AC, in the Santo Domingo Olympic Stadium on 3 June 1976, where over 25,000 fans watched him score a winning goal in the last seconds of the match, leading the Cosmos to a 2\u20131 victory. He led the Cosmos to the 1977 NASL championship, in his third and final season with the club.On 1 October 1977, Pel\u00e9 closed out his career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos. Santos arrived in New York after previously defeating the Seattle Sounders in New Jersey, 2\u20130. The match was played in front of a sold-out crowd at Giants Stadium and was televised in the United States on ABC's Wide World of Sports as well as throughout the world. Pel\u00e9's father and wife both attended the match, as well as Muhammad Ali and Bobby Moore.\n\n\n== International career ==\nPel\u00e9's first international match was a 2\u20131 defeat against Argentina on 7 July 1957 at the Maracan\u00e3. In that match, he scored his first goal for Brazil aged 16 years and nine months, and he remains the youngest goalscorer for his country.\n\n\n=== 1958 World Cup ===\n\nPel\u00e9 arrived in Sweden sidelined by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room, his colleagues stood together and insisted upon his selection. His first match was against the USSR in the third match of the first round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vav\u00e1's second goal. He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup. Against France in the semi-final, Brazil was leading 2\u20131 at halftime, and then Pel\u00e9 scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.\n\nOn 29 June 1958, Pel\u00e9 became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5\u20132 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pel\u00e9's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; \"When Pel\u00e9 scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding\". When the match ended, Pel\u00e9 passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pel\u00e9 began wearing a jersey with number 10. The event was the result of disorganization: the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did not send the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt to Pel\u00e9 who was a substitute on the occasion. The press proclaimed Pel\u00e9 the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind Didi.\n\n\n=== South American Championship ===\nPel\u00e9 also played in the South American Championship. In the 1959 competition he was named best player of the tournament and was top scorer with 8 goals, as Brazil came second despite being unbeaten in the tournament. He scored in five of Brazil's six games, including two goals against Chile and a hat-trick against Paraguay.\n\n\n=== 1962 World Cup ===\n\nWhen the 1962 World Cup started, Pel\u00e9 was the best rated player in the world. In the first match of the 1962 World Cup in Chile, against Mexico, Pel\u00e9 assisted the first goal and then scored the second one, after a run past four defenders, to go up 2\u20130. He injured himself in the next game while attempting a long-range shot against Czechoslovakia. This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament, and forced coach Aymor\u00e9 Moreira to make his only lineup change of the tournament. The substitute was Amarildo, who performed well for the rest of the tournament. However, it was Garrincha who would take the leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title, after beating Czechoslovakia at the final in Santiago.\n\n\n=== 1966 World Cup ===\nPel\u00e9 was the most famous footballer in the world during the 1966 World Cup in England, and Brazil fielded some world champions like Garrincha, Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the addition of other stars like Jairzinho, Tost\u00e3o and G\u00e9rson, leading to high expectations for them. Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for brutal fouls on Pel\u00e9 that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.Pel\u00e9 scored the first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, becoming the first player to score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed the second game against Hungary. His coach stated that after the first game he felt \"every team will take care of him in the same manner\". Brazil lost that game and Pel\u00e9, although still recovering, was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola. Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender Jo\u00e3o Morais fouled Pel\u00e9, but was not sent off by referee George McCabe; a decision retrospectively viewed as being among the worst refereeing errors in World Cup history. Pel\u00e9 had to stay on the field limping for the rest of the game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time. After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he would later change.\n\n\n=== 1970 World Cup ===\n\nPel\u00e9 was called to the national team in early 1969, he refused at first, but then accepted and played in six World Cup qualifying matches, scoring six goals. The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was expected to be Pel\u00e9's last. Brazil's squad for the tournament featured major changes in relation to the 1966 squad. Players like Garrincha, Nilton Santos, Valdir Pereira, Djalma Santos and Gilmar had already retired. However, Brazil's 1970 World Cup squad, which included players like Pel\u00e9, Rivelino, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Carlos Alberto Torres, Tost\u00e3o and Clodoaldo, is often considered to be the greatest football team in history.\n\nThe front five of Jairzinho, Pel\u00e9, Gerson, Tost\u00e3o and Rivelino together created an attacking momentum, with Pel\u00e9 having a central role in Brazil's way to the final. All of Brazil's matches in the tournament (except the final) were played in Guadalajara, and in the first match against Czechoslovakia, Pel\u00e9 gave Brazil a 2\u20131 lead, by controlling Gerson's long pass with his chest and then scoring. In this match Pel\u00e9 attempted to lob goalkeeper Ivo Viktor from the half-way line, only narrowly missing the Czechoslovak goal. Brazil went on to win the match, 4\u20131. In the first half of the match against England, Pel\u00e9 nearly scored with a header that was saved by the England goalkeeper Gordon Banks. In the second half, he controlled a cross from Tost\u00e3o before flicking the ball to Jairzinho who scored the only goal.Against Romania, Pel\u00e9 scored two goals, with Brazil winning by a final score of 3\u20132. In the quarterfinals against Peru, Brazil won 4\u20132, with Pel\u00e9 assisting Tost\u00e3o for Brazil's third goal. In their semi-final match, Brazil faced Uruguay for the first time since the 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2\u20131, and Pel\u00e9 assisted Rivelino for the 3\u20131. During that match, Pel\u00e9 made one of his most famous plays. Tost\u00e3o passed the ball for Pel\u00e9 to collect which Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of and ran off his line to get the ball before Pel\u00e9. However, Pel\u00e9 got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left, while Pel\u00e9 went to the goalkeepers right. Pel\u00e9 ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.Brazil played Italy in the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pel\u00e9 scored the opening goal with a header after outjumping Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. Brazil's 100th World Cup goal, Pel\u00e9's leap of joy into the arms of teammate Jairzinho in celebrating the goal is regarded as one of the most iconic moments in World Cup history. He then made assists on Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth finished by Carlos Alberto. The last goal of the game is often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team's outfield players. The play culminated after Pel\u00e9 made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto's running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4\u20131, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pel\u00e9 received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. Burgnich, who marked Pel\u00e9 during the final, was quoted saying \"I told myself before the game, he's made of skin and bones just like everyone else \u2013 but I was wrong\". In terms of his goals and assist throughout the 1970 World Cup, Pel\u00e9 was directly responsible for 53% of Brazil's goals throughout the tournament.Pel\u00e9's last international match was on 18 July 1971 against Yugoslavia in Rio de Janeiro. With Pel\u00e9 on the field, the Brazilian team's record was 67 wins, 14 draws and 11 losses. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Pel\u00e9 and Garrincha.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\n\nPel\u00e9 has also been known for connecting the phrase \"The Beautiful Game\" with football. A prolific goalscorer, he was known for his ability to anticipate opponents in the area and finish off chances with an accurate and powerful shot with either foot. Pel\u00e9 was also a hard-working team-player, and a complete forward, with exceptional vision and intelligence, who was recognised for his precise passing, and ability to link-up with teammates and provide them with assists.In his early career, he played in a variety of attacking positions. Although he usually operated inside the penalty area as a main striker or centre forward, his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role, as an inside forward or second striker, or out wide. In his later career, he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pel\u00e9's unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints in order to get past players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca. Another one of his signature moves was the paradinha, or little stop.Despite his relatively small stature, 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m), he excelled in the air, due to his heading accuracy, timing, and elevation. Renowned for his bending shots, he was also an accurate free-kick taker, and penalty taker, although he often refrained from taking penalties, stating that he believed it to be a cowardly way to score.Pel\u00e9 was also known to be a fair and highly influential player, who stood out for his charismatic leadership and sportsmanship on the pitch. His warm embrace of Bobby Moore following the Brazil vs England game at the 1970 World Cup is viewed as the embodiment of sportsmanship, with The New York Times stating the image \"captured the respect that two great players had for each other. As they exchanged jerseys, touches and looks, the sportsmanship between them is all in the image. No gloating, no fist-pumping from Pel\u00e9. No despair, no defeatism from Bobby Moore.\" Pel\u00e9 also earned a reputation for often being a decisive player for his teams, due to his tendency to score crucial goals in important matches.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\nPel\u00e9 is one of the most lauded players in history and is frequently ranked the best player ever. Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated; \"Pel\u00e9 was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic.\" Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined; \"His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game.\" Tost\u00e3o, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup; \"Pel\u00e9 was the greatest \u2013 he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pel\u00e9.\" His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed; \"In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful.\"\nPel\u00e9 is the greatest player of all time. He reigned supreme for 20 years. There's no one to compare with him.\nFormer Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s stated; \"The greatest player in history was Di St\u00e9fano. I refuse to classify Pel\u00e9 as a player. He was above that.\" Just Fontaine, French striker and leading scorer at the 1958 World Cup; \"When I saw Pel\u00e9 play, it made me feel I should hang up my boots.\" England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore commented: \"Pel\u00e9 was the most complete player I've ever seen, he had everything. Two good feet. Magic in the air. Quick. Powerful. Could beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches tall, yet he seemed a giant of an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football pitch. I remember Saldanha the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pel\u00e9. The man could play in any position\". Former Manchester United striker and member of England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby Charlton stated; \"I sometimes feel as though football was invented for this magical player.\" During the 1970 World Cup, when Manchester United defender Paddy Crerand (who was part of the ITV panel) was asked; \"How do you spell Pel\u00e9?\", he replied with the response; \"Easy: G-O-D.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nSince retiring, Pel\u00e9 has continued to be lauded by players, coaches, journalists and others. Brazilian attacking midfielder Zico, who represented Brazil at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup, stated; \"This debate about the player of the century is absurd. There's only one possible answer: Pel\u00e9. He's the greatest player of all time, and by some distance I might add\". French three time Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini said; \"There's Pel\u00e9 the man, and then Pel\u00e9 the player. And to play like Pel\u00e9 is to play like God.\" Joint FIFA Player of the Century, Argentina's 1986 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona stated; \"It's too bad we never got along, but he was an awesome player\". Prolific Brazilian striker Rom\u00e1rio, winner of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and player of the tournament; \"It's only inevitable I look up to Pel\u00e9. He's like a God to us\". Five-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo said: \"Pel\u00e9 is the greatest player in football history, and there will only be one Pel\u00e9\", while Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, two-time UEFA Champions League winning manager, commented; \"I think he is football. You have the real special one \u2013 Mr. Pel\u00e9.\" Real Madrid honorary president and former player, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, opined: \"The best player ever? Pel\u00e9. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are both great players with specific qualities, but Pel\u00e9 was better\".\n\nPresenting Pel\u00e9 the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, former South African president Nelson Mandela said; \"To watch him play was to watch the delight of a child combined with the extraordinary grace of a man in full.\" US politician and political scientist Henry Kissinger stated, \"Performance at a high level in any sport is to exceed the ordinary human scale. But Pel\u00e9's performance transcended that of the ordinary star by as much as the star exceeds ordinary performance.\" After a reporter asked if his fame compared to that of Jesus, Pel\u00e9 quipped, \"There are parts of the world where Jesus Christ is not so well known.\"\n\nIn 1999, the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) voted Pel\u00e9 the World Player of the Century. That same year, the International Olympic Committee elected him the Athlete of the Century. According to the IFFHS, Pel\u00e9 is the most successful league goal-scorer in the world, scoring 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial friendlies and tour games. In 1999, Time magazine named Pel\u00e9 one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. During his playing days, Pel\u00e9 was for a period the highest-paid athlete in the world. Pel\u00e9's \"electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals\" made him a star around the world. To take full advantage of his popularity, his teams toured internationally. During his career, he became known as \"The Black Pearl\" (A P\u00e9rola Negra), \"The King of Football\" (O Rei do Futebol), \"The King Pel\u00e9\" (O Rei Pel\u00e9) or simply \"The King\" (O Rei). In 2014, the city of Santos inaugurated the Pel\u00e9 museum \u2013 Museu Pel\u00e9 \u2013 which displays a 2,400 piece collection of Pel\u00e9 memorabilia. Approximately $22 million was invested in the construction of the museum, housed in a 19th-century mansion.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Relationships and children ===\n\nPel\u00e9 has married three times, and has had several affairs, producing several children.\nOn 21 February 1966, Pel\u00e9 married Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi. They had two daughters and one son: Kelly Cristina (born 13 January 1967), who married Dr. Arthur DeLuca, Jennifer (b. 1978), and their son Edson (\"Edinho\", b. 27 August 1970). The couple divorced in 1982. In May 2014, Edinho was jailed for 33 years for laundering money from drug trafficking. On appeal the sentence was reduced to 12 years and 10 months.From 1981 to 1986, Pel\u00e9 was romantically linked with TV presenter Xuxa, which was influential in launching her career. She was 17 when they started dating. In April 1994, Pel\u00e9 married psychologist and gospel singer Ass\u00edria Lemos Seixas, who gave birth on 28 September 1996 to twins Joshua and Celeste through fertility treatments. The couple divorced in 2008.Pel\u00e9 had at least two more children from former affairs. Sandra Machado, who was born from an affair Pel\u00e9 had in 1964 with a housemaid, Anizia Machado, fought for years to be acknowledged by Pel\u00e9, who refused to submit to DNA tests. Although she was recognized by courts as his biological daughter based on DNA evidence in 1993, Pel\u00e9 never acknowledged his eldest daughter even after her death in 2006, nor her two children, Octavio and Gabriel. Pel\u00e9 also had another daughter, Fl\u00e1via Kurtz, in an extramarital affair in 1968 with journalist Lenita Kurtz. Fl\u00e1via was recognized by him as his daughter.At the age of 73, Pel\u00e9 announced his intention to marry 41-year-old Marcia Aoki, a Japanese-Brazilian importer of medical equipment from Pen\u00e1polis, S\u00e3o Paulo, whom he had been dating from 2010. They first met in the mid-1980s in New York, before meeting again in 2008. They married in July 2016.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn 1970, Pel\u00e9 was investigated by the Brazilian military dictatorship for suspected leftist sympathies. Declassified documents showed Pel\u00e9 was investigated after being handed a manifesto calling for the release of political prisoners. Pel\u00e9 himself did not get further involved within political struggles in the country.In 1976, Pel\u00e9 was on a Pepsi-sponsored trip in Lagos, Nigeria, when that year's attempted military coup took place. Pel\u00e9 was trapped in a hotel together with Arthur Ashe and other tennis pros, who were participating in the interrupted 1976 Lagos WCT tournament. Pel\u00e9 and his crew eventually left the hotel to stay at the residence of Brazil's ambassador as they couldn't leave the country for a couple of days. Later the airport was opened and Pel\u00e9 left the country disguised as a pilot.In June 2013, he was criticized in public opinion for his conservative views. During the 2013 protests in Brazil, Pel\u00e9 asked for people to \"forget the demonstrations\" and support the Brazil national team.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nIn 1977, Brazilian media reported that Pel\u00e9 had his right kidney removed. In November 2012, Pel\u00e9 underwent a successful hip operation. In December 2017, Pel\u00e9 appeared in a wheelchair at the 2018 World Cup draw in Moscow where he was pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Diego Maradona. A month later he collapsed from exhaustion and was taken to hospital. In 2019, after a hospitalisation because of a urinary tract infection, Pel\u00e9 underwent surgery to remove kidney stones. In February 2020 his son Edinho reported that Pel\u00e9 was unable to walk independently and reluctant to leave home, ascribing his condition to a lack of rehabilitation following his hip operation.\n\n\n=== Public image ===\nHe is known for frequently referring to himself in the third person.\n\n\n== After football ==\n\nIn 1994, Pel\u00e9 was appointed a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. In 1995, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed Pel\u00e9 to the position of Extraordinary Minister for Sport. During this time he proposed legislation to reduce corruption in Brazilian football, which became known as the \"Pel\u00e9 law.\" Pel\u00e9 left his position in 2001 after he was accused of involvement in a corruption scandal that stole $700,000 from UNICEF. It was claimed that money given to Pel\u00e9's company for a benefit match was not returned after it was cancelled, although nothing was proven, and it was denied by UNICEF. In 1997, he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace. Pel\u00e9 also helped inaugurate the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, alongside supermodel Claudia Schiffer.\n\nIn 1993, Pel\u00e9 publicly accused the Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira of corruption after Pel\u00e9's television company was rejected in a contest for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup. Pel\u00e9 accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair. As a consequence of the affair, the President of FIFA, Jo\u00e3o Havelange banned Pel\u00e9 from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban were perceived to have negatively affected Havelange's chances of re-election as FIFA's president in 1994.Pel\u00e9 has published several autobiographies, starred in documentary films, and composed musical pieces, including the soundtrack for the film Pel\u00e9 in 1977. He appeared in the 1981 film Escape to Victory, about a World War II-era football match between Allied prisoners of war and a German team. Pel\u00e9 starred alongside other footballers of the 1960s and 1970s, with actors Michael Caine, and Sylvester Stallone. \nin 1969, Pel\u00e9 starred in a telenovela called Os Estranhos, about first contact with aliens. It was created to drum up interest in the Apollo missions. In 2001, had a cameo role in the satire film, Mike Bassett: England Manager.\n\nIn November 2007, Pel\u00e9 was in Sheffield, England to mark the 150th anniversary of the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C. Pel\u00e9 was the guest of honour at Sheffield's anniversary match against Inter Milan at Bramall Lane. As part of his visit, Pel\u00e9 opened an exhibition which included the first public showing in 40 years of the original hand-written rules of football. Pel\u00e9 scouted for Premier League club Fulham in 2002. He made the draw for the qualification groups for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals. On 1 August 2010, Pel\u00e9 was introduced as the Honorary President of a revived New York Cosmos, aiming to field a team in Major League Soccer. In August 2011, ESPN reported that Santos were considering bringing him out of retirement for a cameo role in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, although this turned out to be false.\n\nThe most notable area of Pel\u00e9's life since football is his ambassadorial work. In 1992, he was appointed a UN ambassador for ecology and the environment. He was also awarded Brazil's Gold Medal for outstanding services to the sport in 1995. In 2012, Pel\u00e9 was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh for \"significant contribution to humanitarian and environmental causes, as well as his sporting achievements\".In 2009, Pel\u00e9 assisted the Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In July 2009 he spearheaded the Rio 2016 presentation to the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa General Assembly in Abuja, Nigeria.On 12 August 2012, Pel\u00e9 was an attendee at the 2012 Olympic hunger summit hosted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street, London, part of a series of international efforts which have sought to respond to the return of hunger as a high-profile global issue. Later on the same day, Pel\u00e9 appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, following the handover section to the next host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn March 2016, Pel\u00e9 filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking US$30 million in damages claiming violations under the Lanham Act for false endorsement and a state law claim for violation of his right of publicity. The suit alleged, that at one point Samsung and Pel\u00e9 came close to entering into a licensing agreement for Pel\u00e9 to appear in a Samsung advertising campaign. Samsung abruptly pulled out of the negotiations. The October 2015 Samsung ad in question, included a partial face shot of a man who allegedly \"very closely resembles\" Pel\u00e9 and also a superimposed high-definition television screen next to the image of the man featuring a \"modified bicycle or scissors-kick\", often used by Pel\u00e9.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nSantos\n\nCampeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A (6): 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1968\nCopa Libertadores (2): 1962, 1963\nIntercontinental Cup (2): 1962, 1963\nIntercontinental Supercup: 1968\nCampeonato Paulista (10): 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1973\nTorneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo (4): 1959, 1963, 1964, 1966New York Cosmos\n\nNorth American Soccer League, Soccer Bowl: 1977\nNorth American Soccer League, Atlantic Conference Championship: 1977Brazil\n\nFIFA World Cup (3): 1958, 1962, 1970Individual\nIn December 2000, Pel\u00e9 and Maradona shared the prize of FIFA Player of the Century by FIFA. The award was originally intended to be based upon votes in a web poll, but after it became apparent that it favoured Diego Maradona, many observers complained that the Internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play, but not Pel\u00e9. FIFA then appointed a \"Family of Football\" committee of FIFA members to decide the winner of the award together with the votes of the readers of the FIFA magazine. The committee chose Pel\u00e9. Since Maradona was winning the Internet poll, however, it was decided he and Pel\u00e9 should share the award.\nCopa Libertadores Top Scorer: 1965\nIntercontinental Cup Top Scorer (2): 1962, 1963\nCampeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A Top Scorer (3): 1961, 1963, 1964\nCampeonato Paulista Top Scorer (11): 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1969, 1973\nTorneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo Top Scorer: 1963\nBola de Prata: 1970\nFIFA World Cup Best Young Player: 1958\nFIFA World Cup Silver Ball: 1958\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball (Best Player): 1970\nSouth American Championship Best Player: 1959\nSouth American Championship Top Scorer: 1959\nFIFA Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur: 2013\nWorld Player of the Century, by the IFFHS: 1999\nSouth American player of the century, by the IFFHS: 1999\nElected best Brazilian player of the century, by the IFFHS: 2006\nFrance Football's Ballon d'Or (7): 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1970  \u2013 Le nouveau palmar\u00e8s (the new winners)\nFIFA Player of the Century: 2000\nFIFA Order of Merit: 1984\nFIFA Centennial Award: 2004\nFIFA 100 Greatest Living Footballers: 2004\nWinner of France Football's World Cup Top-100 1930\u20131990\nBBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year: 1970\nBBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award: 2005\nLaureus Lifetime Achievement Award: 2000\nGreatest football player to have ever played the game, by Golden Foot: 2012\nAthlete of the Century, by Reuters News Agency: 1999\nAthlete of the Century, elected by International Olympic Committee: 1999\nSouth American Footballer of the Year: 1973\nFootball Player of the Century, elected by France Football's Ballon d'Or Winners: 1999\nInducted into the American National Soccer Hall of Fame: 1992\nWorld Team of the 20th Century: 1998\nTIME: One of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century: 1999\nWorld Soccer Greatest XI of All Time: 2013\nFWA Tribute Award: 2018\nIncluded in the North American Soccer League (NASL) All-Star team (3): 1975, 1976, 1977\nNumber 10 retired by the New York Cosmos as a recognition to his contribution to the club: 1977\nElected Citizen of the World, by the United Nations: 1977\nElected Goodwill Ambassador, by UNESCO: 1993Orders\n\nKnight of the Order of Rio Branco: 1967\nKnight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (honorary knighthood): 1997\nElected Commander of the Order of Rio Branco after scoring the thousandth goal: 1969\nAwarded with the Cross of the Order of the Republic of Hungary: 1994\nAwarded the FIFA Order as a tribute to his 80 years as a sports institution: 1984\nAwarded with the Order of Merit of South America, by CONMEBOL: 1984\nAwarded with the Order of Champions, by the Organization of Catholic Youth in the USA: 1978\nHe was awarded the National Order of Merit, by the government of Brazil: 1991\nOlympic Order, by the International Olympic Committee: 2016\n\n\n== Personal records ==\nBrazil national football team: All-time leading goalscorer: 77 goals (95 goals including unofficial friendlies)\nAll-time South American leading international goalscorer: 77 goals\nSantos: All-time leading goalscorer: 643 goals in 656 competitive games\nIntercontinental Cup: All-time leading goalscorer: 7 goals\nWorld record number of hat-tricks: 92\nGuinness World Records: Most career goals (football): 1283 goals in 1363 games\nGuinness World Records: Most FIFA World Cup winners' medals: three\nGuinness World Records: Youngest winner of a FIFA World Cup: 17 years and 249 days in 1958 FIFA World Cup\nYoungest goalscorer in a FIFA World Cup: 17 years and 239 days (Brazil v Wales 1958)\nYoungest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup: 17 years and 244 days (Brazil v France 1958)\nYoungest player to play in a FIFA World Cup Final: 17 years and 249 days (Brazil v Sweden 1958)\nYoungest goalscorer in a FIFA World Cup Final: 17 years and 249 days (Brazil v Sweden 1958)\nMost assists provided in FIFA World Cup history: 10, (1958\u20131970)\nMost assists provided in a single FIFA World Cup tournament: 7, (1970)\nMost assists provided in a FIFA World Cup Final: 3, (1958 and 1970)\nTop scorer in a FIFA World Cup Final (joint with Vav\u00e1, Geoff Hurst and Zinedine Zidane): 3 goals\nYoungest goalscorer of the Paulista Championship: 1957 \u2013 Santos (he was 17 years old during the competition)\nYoungest FIFA World Cup winner: in 1958 \u2013 Brazil (17 years)\nYoungest two-time FIFA World Cup winner: in 1962 \u2013 Brazil (21 years)\nRecord Top scorer in a calendar year: in 1959 \u2013 127 goals\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nPel\u00e9's goalscoring record is often reported by FIFA as being 1281 goals in 1363 games.

          "The museum actually was closed because it was Carnival but it was worth a trip there just to see the outside. I'm sure the inside was spectacular! From the museum you can walk past a bunch of huge murals painted on the warehouses on the way to the Aquarium.",
          "We were fortunate enough to have visited late on a weekend afternoon just as the evening's festivities were ramping up. The activities inside the building spilled out onto the giant plaza area. It was a massive block party! Rio!!!",
          "Great architecture, very well laid out with good interactive installations. You can spend as much or as little time as you like here. But well worth going and getting involved even for a couple of hours. Take a walk along the boulevard and see the great works of art too while",
          "I like interactive exposition and architecture of the building that is unique and situated on the ocean shore",
          "I loved visiting this building which is designed by the same modern architect who did the beautiful Puente de Mujeures in Buenos Aires. As an English speaking visitor much of the museum exhibits are in Portuguese and the overall theme is we need to take care of our planet, our",
          "Amazing and very actual theme in our planet. It\u2019s a wonderful building. Architech love this place. Interior and exterior are Beautiful. Good for all people.",
          "The building itself is a piece of art. The way the museum is structured and the information is displayed is very dinamic. Good for all: children, teens and adults. Two hours of pure enjoyment!",
          "I am a great fun of Calatravas works. The location a d the design are breathtaking. I had no chance to enter. I hope I will have a chance to visit inside next time I will be in Rio.",
          "This was a painful experience. The good part: The building is beautiful and some of the information is interesting. The bad: 1:15h queue to get in then as soon as you are inside you have to queue for another hour to get into the auditorium for an 8 minute video (In",
          "We did not have enough time to explore the exhibition, but the building leaves great impression. Must see in Rio!",
          "We were impressed by how well this museum meets the needs of multi lingual people. Upon entering you are given a card which prompts any activity you engage in to be in your own language. We felt like we learned a lot and loved the architecture and displays in this museum.",
          "Very nice architecture with some interesting things to see. The reality of the last exposition would be great to everybody to see. How are planet is changing fast and not to a good one. Very good to all ages.",
          "This is not a must see visit when in Rio in my personal opinion. I normally enjoy a visit to a good museum but apart from a rather interesting building the actual content of this is very limited. As the tickets are 20 reals I was expecting much more. There is a short film that",
          "Interesting building on the seaside. The message is important, but feels that the contents of the exhibition is more art than science and a little abridged. Especially for English speakers",
          "Really enjoyed our trip to admire this stunning structure. Combine it with a trip to the art museum or meander through Saraa shopping area for a full fulfilled day.",
          "Sure, it's about an important topic, but watch some documentaries about global warming, pollution & waste and population growth and you are up to speed. If you are interested in those topics you might already know most of things shown here. The introduction is only in portuguese",
          "When we went, it was closed. So We can rate only as building, from its external architectonic. It looked like spacecraft. It was impressive. It is by the sea.",
          "It was an incredible experience. The Museum's exhibitions make us think about who we are and where we are going. Transforming experience",
          "This can be considered a new attraction in Rio de Janeiro. The architeture is beautiful and it is easy to walk around. You will not see pictures from famous painters but many spaces where they address the need to protect the planet. It is located very close to the port where",
          "I am not a museum person. But after much insistence from locals, we went. Thank God. It was very cool. The exhibits and movie were fascinating. If you can carve out time in your visit to Rio to see this, do it.",
          "I was torn on going to visit the museum, but ultimately decided that it looked cool and I should check it out (plus it was raining outside so I don\u2019t have much else to do in Rio for the day). The museum is actually cool and has the potential to be a great experience for guests",
          "For a rather religious country it's a huge achievement to creat such a scientific museum telling about the development of Earth and human civilization, mentioning such numbers as 200 mil years for the planet, or 40k years for man. On the other hand, despite the building is only",

          "A very different museum, with lots of things related to science and the environment for kids and adults. In terms of architecture it is amazing! Avoid going on the weekends - lines can be long, but it was worth going!",
          "We had heard good reports about this place but were disappointed. We felt the interactions were good but got fed up of pressing buttons and the screens became too much for us after a while. I noticed some of the communication from the screens were written on normal notices at",
          "We went on a weekday afternoon, and the line to get in was literally out the door and all the way to the street. So, we didn\u2019t even go inside. The outside looks nice, and the location is right on the port/harbor. There are vendors nearby to buy snacks and souvenirs.",
          "I\u00b4ve been to many museums around the world and I have to say that, even though the content is not very extensive, this is one of the most impressive museums I\u00b4ve been to, mainly because instead of going to the past it goes to the future, which makes it different, but also",
          "Really thought provoking museum with powerful and emotive messages on sustainability and climate change. The exhibits were mostly visual and interactive, appealing to a wide audience as well as having portuguese, spanish and english text. I only hope the electricity to power",
          "When you enter it seems quite interesting, there's a couple exhibits in English but the majority aren't and they really won't tell you anything you don't already know, could've been a lot better had they not just catered for English speakers near the door",
          "After our plans of spending the day on the beach were ruled out because of a very rainy Rio day, we decided to spend the afternoon at the Museum on Tomorrow. A really fantastic museum, really thought provoking about environmental and sustainability issues. Loads of interactive",
          "We took the museum in on an unexpected rainy day. We spent 3-4 hours really engaged with the concept it was excellent, the way it flowed was brilliant and informative. We were also appreciative of the English translation of everything. For around \u00a35 entry absolutely a must",
          "The Museum of Tomorrow is a science museum in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was designed by Spanish neofuturistic architect Santiago Calatrava, and built next to the waterfront at Pier Maua. Amazing, modern building. Strongly recommended",
          "One of the nicer museums to check out, pretty interesting view on what life would be like in the future",
          "I enjoyed this more than I thought. To be honest, was not planning to come here but had more time in Rio than thought. Combined with a rainy afternoon, this was perfect. It looks huge but not that much and really depends on how 'interactive' you want to be. I loved it and",
          "The Museu do Amanh\u00e3 or the \"Museum of Tomorrow\" is a magnificent building by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. It's located at the far end of the Pra\u00e7a Maua' near the harbour. As others have said, very tech and mostly videos and film presentations but very interesting",
          "It\u2019s a very unique museum, quite modern and very tech heavy, but not a lot to see, great as a stop if you have more than a few days in Rio. Lot of the stuff is in Portuguese but there is some English subtitles here and there",
          "Museu do Amanh\u00e3 explores the history of our planet and the extent of anthropogenic impacts on our future within an oustanding modern building, full of interactive exhibits. Though the presentation of anthropogenic impacts may be biased towards the technocratic, simplistic",
          "When you go the recently revitalized seaport area, it's like walking into a whole new world. The view is breathtaking and the museum stands out like a futuristic spaceship in the middle of the water. And this is the aim of the Museu do Amanh\u00e3, to take you into how we'll be",
          "The museum has a beautiful design; however, this is not a traditional museum with paintings and sculptures. It\u2019s mostly video/interactive kind of art. Nevertheless, it was still fun and interesting. Tuesdays are free, however you NEED to get there before opening at 10am,",
          "Huge queue, more than one hour waiting to buy tickets. Plus 45 minutes waiting for our order at the unique caf\u00e9 (food was not so good either). The museum is ok, might be interesting for teens.",
          "We went to this museum in June of 2019. I was amazed by the exhibits and information. It is pretty much up to date, but the charging station can be changed to wireless now (lol). I highly recommend for all ages, especially above 6. We certainly will return to spend more time",
          "The museum has different displays and the design is something totaly different. The area around the place has been modeled since the olympic games and is muche better now. There is a day of the week that it\u00b4s free... I cannot remember now when...",
          "This museum is comprised by the history of humans and ideas bout the future. It seems to be aimed at problems of today's society, such as overpopulation in cities, increased CO2 in the atmosphere and loss of biodiversity. It has a vibe to it of being a little too doomsday-ish.",
          "Every bit as amazing as the Sydney Opera House. The information and displays are brilliant and every city needs to replicate something like this. Architecture to stun.",
          "This museum is worth a visit. Start off by watching the video first (most not in English, but the pics were cool). Interesting interactive displays about what\u2019s happening to the earth. You get a card with your language selected and once you register upstairs, you can use this",
          "We had a great time here just what we needed on a rainy day. We visited on Tuesday which we didn\u2019t know but it is free entry so was amazing. Really interesting place and great cafe",
          "Beautifully located at the sea Modern way of tellling the story Bring a couple of friends, if you can",
          "Overall this isn't a terrible museum, but it's nothing special when compared to others around the world. However, Rio and Brazil doesn't have many so it's still really good comparatively. I was surprised to show up on a Tuesday to get free admission which I didn't know",
          "Was allowed in out of the rain to visit cafe & shops, but was also able to see the world globe with all it's changes. Wish I had more time to do a Museum visit fully.",
          "The Museum is something a bit different in a huge building overlooking the bay and a 11km bridge . You can look at the murals close by outside and can walk along the water into Downtown . The Museum is thought provocative as it puts our future in doubt as the environmental",
          "I went to the museum because it's designed by architect Santiago Calatrava, surprised by how meaningful the content inside the museum is! The exhibit really made me think about how our everyday life's decision is impacting the planet, I will call it the museum of climate change.",
          "Really great space and well put together. Highly recommended, especially if you are a science nerd. Different and unique.",
          "We went to the Praca Maua area to see the famous graffiti warehouses and stumbled across this museum. Don't know if it is normally free on Tuesdays or if we just got lucky. I would recommend it for anyone visiting Rio, especially families.",
          "Makes us think what we are doing with our planet and how the choices we are making impacts in our planet. Very interactive, it is a great choice for all types of public.",
          "Very futuristic building and THE eye-catcher of Rio de Janeiros downtown, From outside , looking over the bay from the other side of the enormous pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1, from the port, at day and at night it impresses by it\u00b4s dynamic \"out-of-the-water-jumping\" shape. Extended at the Pier",
          "Love the area around it. The museum itself. So gland I didn't pay ridiculous amount of organised guided tour price. We used metro nearest stop Uruguainian station, probably cost .80p or R$ 2.20 or 1.50 but definatily it work out less than \u00a31.00 then 5-7 min walk ( the walk to",
          "The building is seriously impressive from the inside and the outside. The tickets are quite inexpensive, around R$20. Our expectations might have been to high, there is a 10 minute film inside a \"cubicle\", beautifully done. But it's almost a disappointment when it stops. We",
          "It is a beautiful building by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, in a nice location in downtown Rio. However, the existis are just audivisuals, it does not have its own collection of objects or artwork.",
          "Loved the building, it\u2019s location and its contents. Basically it\u2019s about how humans are impacting on planet earth, with all the stats. Apart from the opening film, everything has English to read. A really well curated museum and worth spending 2-3 hours there.",
          "My gosh, what a place to visit, it is unbeliveable. Words cannot express this stunning museum. My wife and I spent over 3 hours here and only left because they were getting ready to close. When one comes to Rio this is a must see, it is a museum for the young and old alike.",
          "One of the best museums we have visited in years. It was bang up to date on what we, as the human race, are doing and have done to the planet. The dome cinema is a great start and there are many other displays, some interactive which give everyone an insight into possible",
          "With not much left to do we visited the Museum of Tomorrow. If you have kids that love this kind of futuristic exhibition they will definitely be interested in the Museum of Tomorrow which is a new kind of Science with the past, present and future meeting up. The entrance was",
          "The building itself is quite innovative. Some of the exhibits are interesting, but this museum's goal seems to be summarizing hope things are today and making you think about what should be tomorrow. I expected more things like \"the future of this\" or \"groundbreaking",
          "My partner and I visited the museum of tomorrow, coming from NZ I was pleased, the globe at the entrance of the museum didn\u2019t excluded my mother land \ud83d\ude02 was a wonderful rollercoaster of emotions.. I would highly recommend this to everyone and I implore everyone to really take in",
          "We did not go inside the museum as it was closed.It is a fascinating building in a great location ,very photo worthy with the lovely locals partying there during carnival.",
          "This is primarily a science museum. But if you are a fan of architecture. This is a must see. It's about a 15 minute ride from the Copacabana Beach area. You have to check out the outside from front to back as well as the inside. It's an architectural marvel. It also has a",
          "Rio has certainly spent the money on this one. Very modern construction and carbon neutral electricity run.",
          "Good idea to have a museum to celebrate the future and the design is stunning but felt there is lots of empty space that could be better used. Had issues with the check in technology which wasted time as we were on a timescale that day. It was busy and would book in advance if",
          "I did not find it very educational. I was looking for a nugget of info or new point of view to take away....meh....didn\u2019t happen. Free Tuesdays. Architecture was awesome.",
          "It is a nice museum to visit in Rio de Janeiro. The outside area is amazing, with a great view. Inside is quite small, but for the reasonable price it is worth to go. Quick tips: Buy the ticket online, as it has a huge queue for buy on there and you will save some time on your",
          "Super structure and design. Content relied on voice, sound, sight to communicate. Interesting esp to children.",
          "We were in Brazil and didn\u2019t have anything planned one day and somebody told us to go to the museum of tomorrow and the aquarium as they were both great. The museum of Tomorrow certainly was great. The aquarium not so much. Anyway we really learned some things at this museum and",
          "The architecture of Calatrava impressed us deeply. From far and from near it develops always new perspectives. The location at the bay combines with the fragile forms of the building, creating an impression of an aquatic animal. The didactical concept of the museum is tailored",
          "It\u2019s an amazing architecture and the visit takes you in a trip from where we come from to where we are going. It\u2019s simply fantastic! If you interact with the panels and really appreciate everything that the museum has to offer you will spend many hours in there.",
          "This stylish modern building holds an interesting interactive presentation. Well planned, nicely presented, and including lovely architectural views, it is a bit complex and tiring for smaller kids, but teenagers onwards will certainly appreciate the contents.",
          "The museum of tomorrow is an attractive structure close to the Olympic boulevard. Even if not visiting, it makes a good stop to admire the building and enjoy a cool Acai from one of the street vendors.",
          "Since it was not a good day for the beach, we decided to visit this museum on our last day in Rio, and were quite disappointed! The impressive imposing structure with stunning panoramic views overlooking the waterfront at Pier Maua, evokes some Star Wars-like anticipation whilst",
          "It is good for any age. I have been on Tuesday so it was free. They have a nice coffee shop and a nice shop too.",
          "The name of the museum couldn't be more apropriated. It hasn't any painting or any other work of art, but it makes you think in what we are doing with our planet and what will be our future, with such amazing modern things.",
          "This is a nice enough looking building and yes the views are good, but there are plenty of better views in Rio without having to queue and pay to get in and without being lectured to. I learned literally nothing from the museum, which is just way too obvious and is aiming at a",
          "It\u2019s been huge waste of time,museum if you even should call it that is not for English speakers,but that should not even matter,because there is nothing there,you don\u2019t know already. The huge line up to get there,not very polite staff who chooses who is going priority line who",
          "Bright and modern museum in a nice part of Rio Takes about 1 hour to get around and focused on the future \u00a35 to get in so well worth it",
          "The museum is a must. Surprising and beautiful design. The surroundings are worth of a random walk. Indescribable beauty.",
          "The museu do amanha is housed in an amazing architectural marvel. The building was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. Inside the modern rooms display the impact humans have caused to earth.",
          "This is the best museum I\u2019ve been so far! I definitely recommend going. It\u2019s about the beginning or the world and our future. It starts it a kind of planetarium video show, where we see the beginning of the world. We went around 12/ 12:30 and there was no queue. You can see all",
          "This museum is quite different from others. Located close to the sea with a beautiful view This beautiful museum is a must see attraction In Rio de Janeiro There are interactive screens where you Are well informed about the health, pollution And how we treat our Mother",

          "The building is nice but nothing else.. inside you don\u2019t learn anything.. we are all aware about the situation of our planet .. Waste of time you can pass and go visit something else",
          "I enjoyed exploring the museum. You can find there information about different topics - universe, cultures around the world and other things.",
          "The concept of this museum is really good and interesting. The main exhibition makes you think about humanity and our planet. It is truly and eye opener and I wish there were more museums like this all around the world. I gave only 4 stars because I didn\u2019t like the layout, I",
          "Futuristic building close to santos dumont airport. Exhibition to the point and with different media used also catching our teenagers and even younger son of 10y. Well done! Great program to combine with the kobra graffities. You can either take the tram for one station or walk",

          "Highly creative and fascinating exhibits show the impact of the anthropocene on our shared planet. This museum is well designed, beautifully airy and quick enough that you don't have to dedicate a full day. If you can, plan on spending a 2 hours here on a Tuesday, when",

          "Excellent museum. It was very interactive and suitable for all ages. Loved the videos and exhibitions. Staff were very helpful.",
          "I can't really recommend the museum. It's a very light gloss over the origin, design, and meaning of the universe. Probably better for children than adults. I didn't want to spend more than 30 minutes in the museum. Please go on Tuesday when it's free, or just check out the",
          "Well done museum with nice architectural design. The expositions are installations that are a little bit too alarming that seems to be connected for some kind of political agenda. The movie is only in Portuguese, no headphones or subtitles where available for non Portuguese",
          "The museum building is amazing, a gem of the futurist architecture. Site in the front of the plaza Maua, an amazing scenario for pictures. The museum is most educative than exhibition. So you can interact with different monitor about science, enviroment . You get a close view",
          "This is a sort of natural history museum with lots of interactive installations but not worth spending the money to enter. The architecture outside is quite striking, not particularly attractive, but certainly striking. My favorite part of the museum was the plaza outside where",
          "The building is awesome , great architecture and construction but I was disappointed with the inside Mostly nothing except literature that you can find on the internet I was expecting a museum but it is just a great building",
          "Truly amazing attractions, worth the visit. My family and i enjoyed our visit very much. We went earlier this year, and regret nothing.",
          "It's located near the harbour and very close to the city centre and Olympic Boulevard. Spend at least 2-3 hours here and go through all of the exhibits, especially the ones describing our impact on the earth and what the latest advances in technology are to combat these",
          "One of my worst nightmares and concernings about our time is about how difficult is for our generation to undestand the effects we couse in our planet. This museum is an opportunity to make a reflection about it, as an invitation to change some of our consumer habits. An",
          "We had a nice couple of hours in and around the museum. We decided to come after literally every tourist office we spoke to shoved a leaflet in our hands. We didn't really have any expectations of what it would be like, they just loved it and said we MUST go! It's a pleasant",
          "This is a fabulous new museum which is interactive and full of interesting facts about the planet. The building itself is stunning and looks like a spaceship.",
          "To begin, the architecture of the building is vey impressive and the surrounding area is beautiful to walk around and enjoy. The exhibits were well researched and quite impressive too I had a few favourites (the flying silks were fascinating!) but on a whole, the museum is more",
          "This is a very interesting with regards to the architecture and the moving solar panels. The exhibits makes you thing what we are doing to this planet. Be sure to get the iris card in your language for the interactive experiences.",
          "This museum in a revitalized area for the Olympics of the city is a masterpiece of architecture and offers a very interesting visit for all ages. The entrance is very cheap and besides the museum the whole area around it is a postcard of the city allowing hiking and with",
          "I visited the Museu do Amanh\u00e3 with my 16 years old daughter and my husband, it is an amazing place with very interesting art installations. Great place to go with kids ana teenagers, the different art promote a important reflection about from where we came and were are we going.",
          "No matter how many natural history or science museums you have been to, this one is a must go! What is very unique about it is the power it has to mobilize you. Over all the Antropoceno Section is the most disturbing and awakening for every visitor. The many panels displayed",
          "Interactive and great for all ages. If you\u2019re unsure of what to do on a rainy day don\u2019t miss this museum!",
          "Went there with my 103 year old grandmother. She can walk, but is very slow, so we requested a wheelchair. Staff promptly help, going to pick her up outside so she didn\u2019t have to walk too much. Everyone was so helpful. The views are amazing!",
          "What to do in Rio when it rains? Try a few museums and this one was very enlightening. It was a walk through our planet and humanity - past , present and most importantly future. What will it be like tomorrow? Interesting perspectives to consider - all detailed in this",
          "Maybe i have visited nicer futuristic museum so did not find this museum worth visiting. I was done in about 20 mins but it could be because of language barrier",

          "I live in Rio. And, honestly, I have not visited the Museum yet. But, all the comments I here are very, very positive. Its region, Pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1, is in the renovated heart of the city - in the begining of Avenida Rio Branco. You can use the metro and the new street car (VLT) to get",
          "The architecture is out of this world. We went on a day where admission was free. Not much of the interaction was available in English which was limiting. Definitely worth a look but check to see if you can go on a day where it\u2019s free.",
          "Do not hesitate to include this spectacular and immersive experience on your itinerary of places to visit in Rio de Janeiro. Give yourself 2 hours to take in the full experience. The architecture is a study in cantilever design and solar panel integration. The interactive kiosks",
          "This is one of my most favorite musea ever. The 12minute documentary is really Well Made and the museum overall is super interactive! Definitely worth visiting!",
          "It was an awesome attempt at educating us about the environment...just wish they had headphones or some type of pamphlet explaining everything in English as well. But we shouldn\u2019t complain too much as we got in for free (most museums are free on Tuesdays).",
          "Don't arrive at the Museum of Tomorrow/Museu de Amanh\u00e3 at or just after 5:00, you'll have to return tomorrow. Don't go on Mondays, you'll have to return tomorrow. After two attempts to visit this Museum I gave up. At that point it became the Museum of the next visit to Rio. By",
          "Best museum we've been to with teens, all our family blown away, exhibits are staged beautifully, you can't help but engage with the moving images. We were all affected and still discussing days later. The building itself is glamorous and positioned right in the harbour. This",
          "The museum was not what I expected. There were some very good exhibitions and some less interesting ones. The interactive bits kept my attention but the parts with lots of reading bored me a bit, I have a short attention span but it is worth the money as it was very reasonably",
          "We went with a 6 year old and a 13 year old kids. They both enjoyed the exhibits. You probably need an hour and a half to visit the museum. We went during sunset and took great pictures from the museum windows.",
          "Nice museum but not more, missing allot of the info that is not translated to English or other language. All is mainly in Portuguese.",
          "Even if it's not a big place and exhibition, I think the details here speak for themselves and the type of art and ideas that are presented fasctinated me. So much information that is shared, maps of the future, how the railways might look in the future and al digitally. This",
          "Clean and full of technology information about the planet and how far we are destroying it. The maps of what could happen in 5 up too 100 years time too the planet. Beautiful surroundings and a clear message..",
          "Exhibits are really not worth the effort. For international travelers, information readily available in English or at least Spanish would be helpful.",
          "Here are the things that I think make this museum worth visiting: - the walk from the nearest metro will show you a slice of every-day Rio - the building is spectacular, and the views are extraordinary - the exhibits are varied and intriguing, with plaques in both Portuguese and",
          "I was excited about visiting this museum because a few friends told me it was really good. The problem I found was to see that it was a way somebody or organization found to teach evolution and global warming to kids, which I do not believe or agree with. God created all things",
          "I like this museum very much and it is very informative about the changes our planet is going through. Very educational to children about what happens to our planet and how we influence it. This is a museum of all ages. The building itself is also very beautiful and has a unique",
          "Stunning building and a very informative and thought provoking exhibition. Most aspects are interactive which make it great fun for young and old.

          "Calatrava's work is beautiful. Fantastic! You can recognize his traits wherever. Very nice. The museum itself is also very interesting. You think about life, space, time, and how small we are. The only thing I thought was kinda contradictory is that there is no specific trash to",
          "We went as a family to the museum and actually I think this is not for kids a learning... But the museum was very interesting helping to reflect on the future we want to build , great 3 d show .. Highly recommend to spend 1 to 2 hours",
          "It is all about the building at the Museum of Tomorrow. And an impressive piece of architecture it is. Not much to see inside although I had fun playing the computer games trying to save the world from the anthropocene. Hard to get to - use the Tram Line 1 - and not worth",
          "In fact the steel frame building is unique. As a museum, it is oriented for youngsters. The set up and layout is very futuristic. If you are in old city center, walk a bit until the waterfront, and walk around, it will take less than an hour, including an expresso at the coffee",
          "Truly a must visit when in Rio. An evolution of the arts. A futuristic approach combining technology and art to create multiple beauties. From the entrance till you finish your tour, you will be completely blown away.",
          "Really worthwhile exhibition providing a great education on the future and how we interact with it. You receive an interactive card for the displays, which for me were all in Portuguese, which meant I couldn't understand much. Towards the end I noticed others were interacting",
          "I did not like the building, as the shape does not to me seem to serve a purpose being a museum of tomorrow. Inside it was even more disappointing. You have to watch a video before you go in and then the information inside is anything you can read in the papers and seems to be",
          "The Museum of Tomorrow is a wonderfully interesting attraction. Much like the world's fairs and exposition of yesterday, this museum attempts to entertain as well as educate. This is not a museum in the traditional sense, as there are few artworks or artifacts for the visitor to",
          "The building is designed by Calatrava, the Spanish architect who built the Oculus in NY, among other striking structures. The message of the museum is that we need to save the world from destruction by humans: global warming, depletion of fish stocks, pollution, etc. The",
          "There is a bit false hype about this museum. Architecture is wonderful no doubt, i actually liked the exhibitions inside too but its not something wow. Exhibition is about the past, present and what our choices we make would effect the universe in future. Tickets were by",
          "Sure, building itself is very impressive, but museum's contents can be fit on an A4 brochure. You can enjoy it fully from the outside and/or lobby. Most of this museum's showpieces are made of non-interactive led-screens that project blunt information about ecology, dangers of",
          "Disappointing experience due to the extremely basic messages and experiences. Nice initiative but misses the punch. The architecture compensates. Entrance is very democratic. So still worth to go through.",
          "We spent 3 hours in this brand new museum. With enough English translations, there is no reason to have a guided tour. Brings you from the past, the present and what choices we, as people, need to make to keep our planet habitable in the future. So well done! Interactive with",
          "Marvellous addition to the sights & Museums in RioDeJaneiro. This new museum in Centro on the waterfront just near the Cruise Terminal is fantastic and has great exhibits about the future. A very nice experience with 50% discounts on Entry to over 60 years aged people. A nice",
          "This museum is for sure a must see when you visit Rio de Janeiro. The whole architecture is incredibly amazing. The fact that it is right by the Bay adds a special touch to it. You will for sure spend a lot of time analysing the outside structure. It is beautiful to walk around",
          "The Museum of tomorrow was one of the most impactful experiences I have had at a museum. The exhibits are very comprehensive, thoughtful in both imagery and written word. One will leave feeling both challenged and and inspired for a better tomorrow. Do visit the visual dome",
          "There is not much that I would call memorable to see in this museum. The best is the architecture of the building itself and the views of the surrounding area.",
          "My husband and I ended up here on a whim on a free entrance day. The building itself is beautiful and the message was really moving: making changes to the way we live now so that we can have a better tomorrow. Some exhibits were in English and some weren't and we couldn't figure",
          "The exhibitions are nice and we'll presented, unfortunately, as a huge touristic Attraction it's not tourist friendly at all, the majority is in portougese and some parts aren't even traslated, when they are, it's presented on a small part. Other than that it's not that",
          "We liked the museum, it is in a odern building next to the waterfront. The exhibits are good and quite a bit it is multiple languages. You can register a touch card they give you and then this will convert some other exhibits to the language you choose. The museum entrance is",

          "Enlightening! This place was amazing, I strongly recommend you go. It gets pretty hot in Rio so it\u2019s probably a good middle-of-the-day activity as it\u2019s air-conditioned. Other museums in Rio are housed in more traditional (but very beautiful) buildings so they are not all",

          "While the web site strongly encourages reservations, we were able to buy our tickets the morning of for a 1 pm visit. First of all the building is absolutely stunning. The building is very modern in design. While I expected the museum to feature sci-fi futuristic type of",
          "one of the best museum I've ever visited, just stunning, and anyone will enjoy every step, no matter what age you are. If you come to Rio, you have to find a time to visit...",
          "A terrifying and fascinating look into tomorrow. One of our highlights of our week in Rio. Good for English speakers as well as Portuguese. Ideal for all ages. Book ahead to avoid queuing.",
          "Very nice and futuristic museum. From outside look like a boat. Inside is the planetarium. Possible to see different films and presentations about climate changes of the world and possible future scenarios of world climate changes and it`s impact to mankind.",
          "This amazing Museum is the best I've been all over South America. Not only the content of the Museum but its architecture and view by the Guanabara Bay. I'ts also close to the Kobra Graffiti wall. If you are going to Rio, plan to spend some time at this area.l",
          "It's an amazing, eye-opening experience. I would recommend any person who visits Rio De Janeiro to go and visit this place.",
          "Had to drag my wife here as she is usually surgically attached to the sunbed...she loved it ...!! What a fantastic piece of architecture and the exhibits were even better",
          "The museum is a little far from central Rio, however, I recommend taking the subway there as it is fast and cheap. On the day we went, it was free entry (for some reason!) and the line was quite long. I am not too sure whether it is busy every day but the museum inside was not",
          "We visted the museum and were impressed by the beauty of the building the content. We were amazingly surprised that seniors are free and received preferential treatment.",
          "A great interactive experience (particularly with the \"Cosmos\" 360 video - don't miss it!) but accompanied by content that is not extremely good.",
          "The building is worth seeing from outside at least. The ticket is rather affordable (20r). However the content is completely out of interest: too simple and shallow for adults, not well designed for kids. Don't expect to use your brain there.",
          "Beautiful scenery and interesting expositions. It is a must-see kind of place. You can buy tickets in advance. If you don't buy, make sure you arrive early!",
          "It\u00b4s a different kind of museum and it\u00b4s always full of visitors. The tickets are cheap and the you can take beautiful pictures from the back of the museum. It\u00b4s worth visiting.",
          "This museum is an architects dream and presents the trouble mankind will find itself if we continue to abuse the environment",
          "Great experience but a little crowded avoid getting without tickets sometimes you can't get them for the same day.",
          "Granted: the building itself is beautiful and a must-do if you're interested in modern architecture. I'm not sure the exhibition inside enriched me that much. The premise of the Museum of Tomorrow is to explore different scenarios of what the future could be like but there is",
          "We got to this museum in the afternoon at around 16:30 hours. However, when we tried to get in the entrance officials did not allow us to proceed to the ticket office, which closed at 17:00 hours. The museum itself closed at 18:00 hours. We spent around 20 minutes arguing with",
          "Beautiful architecture, interesting exhibition, no parking lot available, not enough places to hide from the sun and hot weather",
          "From a Brazilian prospective an interactive showcase of people, history, trends, geography, physics, astronomy, etc. Could have been put together anywhere but it is like a huge lifeboat thrust out into the ocean beside the cruise dock in Rio.",
          "We visited this unique museum in Rio de Janeiro. The displays are very good and very informative. The set up is very good.",
          "I'm Brazilian and I can't help whisking it was better! Outside is valid a visited but inside... I live in Europe and I have high expectations in regards museums. It's a such a shame... a self sustainable building with non self sustainable estruture. I do expect a lot but never",
          "All the area was before an old city harbor. The transformation is very well done. In side a very nice and modern museum with interactive experiences for all ages, always supervised by a specialize guide. The new atraction in Rio",
          "The new Museu de Amanh\u00e3 (Museum of Tomorrow) is first of all a nice piece of modern, gravity-challenging architecture, Niemeyer-style. The surroundings of the museum have been completely renovated for the 2016 Olympics and it is now a nice area to walk around. Tickets can be",
          "entry to this museum is limit to low numbers and you need to purchase a ticket early, book the prevoius day",
          "Expect long lines. Go early and carry water to await in the sun expecting your time to enter. Buy your tickets online. The Museum is good, but takes more time to visit considering the lines.",
          "The museum is interesting but the organization and lines to enter are ridicusly disorganized at 42 degrees information is not there People changes lines. Defenitelly fails in mangement, organization, tourism oriented. Workers don't care or do anything; they simply don't",
          "This museum, (the museum of tomorrow), is a beautiful piece of architecture along the Guanabara Bay. It also has interesting exhibits and gives an idea of the history and culture of Rio and Brazil.",
          "This meuseuma has intresting interactive displays - great to visit with kids. The displays are in three languages , however a few of them didnt swith to english. On Tues the museum offers free entry - but gets a bit crowded.",
          "Lets get the good bit over first, the building is stunning and in a wonderful situation on an pier. Thats all you need to see. We didn't book in advance so we had to cue, which took ages, I couldn't understand at first then when we got inside it I realised it was due to the fact",
          "Beautifully designed building and those who like design will appreciate it. We were able to buy tickets on the door and not online as some reviewers have mentioned. We paid by card, however cash seems to have been preferred. You are given an interactive card, which you must",
          "As an architect, I was astounded by Santiago Calatrava's creation. The building is magnificent both externally and internally. The contents of the museum is educational and useful for students - don't expect spectacular exhibition in there.",
          "This place is incredible. Really produces a visceral reaction to the self-destruction of the human kind and its habitat. The visual exhibits are just breathtaking. Definitely a \"next generation\" museum, you will feel engaged from start to finish.",
          "The building itself is quite spectacular. A masterpiece from the Spanish architect Calatrava. You can only buy tickets online. The exhibitions are interesting, all related i on earth's Evolution, the cities, growth of population, climate change etc. Across from this museum is",
          "Yes the architecture is really nice and it gives for beautiful photos. But don't waste your time and money, there is absolutely no need to go inside. The museum of tomorrow is summarized to climate change, and there are much better documentaries out there than their crappy",
          "I expected more of this museum considering the ticket's price! But the expo about the environment was wonderfull... several multimedia rooms spreaded arround the museum, a lot of interactive scenarios and the warning about the environmental degradation, pollution and population",
          "The architecture is very interesting and inside is a very interactive museum about future. The only problem was the queue, we waited about 2 hours under the rain and nobody was helping us to understand the waiting. My advise is to buy the ticket online, the day before.",
          "Beautiful museum with many pictures to see, store for gifts, a cafeteria and some attractions to interact. My son loved the film that told the story of the universe. The only problem was the line, wich was too long!",
          "Sorry, but if you do a lot of reading there's nothing here for you. There were lot's of statements like \"Rio de Janeiro will soon experience an increase in temperature\" on big TVs scrolling across walls. A ton of philosophical crap and information barely based in science. It was",
          "This museum is a little hard to get to, located in central but pretty far from Ipanema and Copa. The architecture and beauty of the venue is worth the trip to me. The exhibits are interactive and mostly in Portuguese, but all feature beautiful modern designs-so for design and",
          "Doesn't worth to get in, but taking photos from outside is always nice. At the front there is a big sign that everyone take photos with each letter. You will get the museum as a background which is quite a nice shot!",
          "The first thing that strikes the visitor is the extraordinary architecture of the building. Quite amazing. There's enough to see inside to justify the price of admission. It places a lot of emphasis on the changing climate and human impact on the planet, which is all very good",
          "I think this was one of the most disappointing places I visited in Rio. The architecture ir wonderful, truly beautiful, inside it was also very pretty. However, the theme on the whole museum was something not new to me (future, sustainability, things like that). It was also way",
          "Nothing interesting and real lack of infrastructure. 2 hours queuing with nobody organising anything. After that there is another 1 hour wait for the main exhibit. Save yourself 20 reais and go somewhere else.",
          "This museum will teach you something only if you are a person who has never watched discovery channel or if you never read news. Otherwise it has hardly any groundbreaking information. The cosmos presentation was particularly poor, it does not teach you anything. It resembled a",
          "The Museum is not conventional, they have temporary exhibitions and the main one. I saw the temporary exhibition \"Rio Hackeado\" and the one about Santos Dumont, and I liked more than the main one, but it's personal. The ticket is very affordable, so it worth to visit, but I was",
          "A nice interesting museum to fill a morning or afternoon - although not sure how much of its environmental predictions about the future will hold with rising geopolitical tensions! Booking in advance is required. The museum offers free entry on Tuesdays and is closed on",
          "The museum is very beautiful outside and inside you must purchase your ticket online it costs 10 reais 5 for students very nice architecture",
          "Contemporary architecture that contrasts, but matches perfectly to the natural scenario, Very impressioning architecture, content with much scientific value presented in an interactive way. Full surround movie in giant sphere well done. You cannot go thru all materials on",
          "At the time of our visit this museum only sold entrance tickets on the internet. So we were unable to see the interior and exhibits. But just seeing the architecture is a WOW experience. The museum is situated in a great area with many sites to see. Try getting in, but if",
          "After our guide told us about this innovative and fascinating museum, we so wanted to visit but we were out of time. But we did get a chance to walk around the museum (after it closed for the day and in the rain). The design of this structure is incredible and awe inspiring.",
          "This really new art and science museum in Rio has a very modern proposal for a museum (Museum of Tomorrow, in a literal translation), it intends to show how we will live in the future. The building, a project from Santiago Calatrava, is quite impressive, very modern and adequate",
          "The museum is not indicated to children under 8 years old since a lot of reading (in computers) is required for a full experience there. It`s a good place to know more about our planet in terms of deforestation, water shortage, and enviroment.",
          "The museum is one of the new attractions in Rio that came along with renovations on the Pier area of Rio, for the Olympics of 2016. It features as its main theme Sustainability and the Future, the exhibits try to warn visitors of the dangers of pollution, and waste, by showing",
          "A really interesting museum about our modification of the world and future impacts. You must book online in advance to avoid huge queues to get in. The only bad thing was that the museum was really busy and you still had to do a lot of queuing inside the museum to see the",
          "I went on a rainy cold day in Rio. Make sure that you buy tickets in advance on-line. It has some interesting long-term exhibits about Planet Earth, climate change and where we are headed. I thought they could have done more with the amazing space they have. But the views from",
          "We wanted to visit the museum but there wasa line up for at least an hour so we olny walked around and enjoyed the views! I would recommend booking the visit in advance!",
          "This is a great place to visit. It is cheap but you CANNOT turn up on the day....you must book your tickets in advance. If booking from the UK DO NOT enter your postcode, but fill everything else in. Great for families but not as hands on as the Science Museum in London,",
          "A really interesting museum, make sure you go online to get your tickets before you go as you can't get them there unless you have data on your phone. Also if you go on a Tuesday it's free but it will be busy. We didn't actually see the 'main' exhibit as the lines were",
          "I dont like the buildings of Calatrava however this building is intersting. Visit the place as Olaza Maua is a must see location",
          "Definitely a must see in Rio, one of the most amazing museus in the world! Good for families, cheap!",
          "Arrived at the museum only to read signs that say tickets must be bought online - didn't have wifi on my phone with me and I'm sure many tourists don't have either so this was really inconvenient that it just can't get tickets there",
          "We bought tickets through Internet. The concept, architecture, displays, themes are very high level. You can visit all of the pavilions, recommend to assist the film only if there is a short line, its not worth waiting 40' for an 8' movie laying on the floor. The rest is",
          "This museum is at the port in Rio, which in itself is an interesting area. Around the outside of the museum is the 'Parade of Wheelchairs', an excellent small exhibition if brightly decorated wheelchairs in honour of the Rio 2016 Paralympics. Inside was a brilliant temporary",
          "The building looks beautiful-is there a functionality in the design? Is its ecological,rather than grandiose, I wish it would say! Book ahead-or wait a long time! And if you are female be warned: only 3 cubicles on the ground floor!!!!what male designed this?!?! The",
          "I booked tickets on-line (free on Tuesdays) with a scheduled visit for 10am - we were the first group. No line ups. I didn't know what to expect and I was in awe with the architecture. The exhibits were breathtaking and thought provoking. Where we are and where are we going as",
          "Not sure if its only during the Para/ Olympics but we went to the Museum of Tomorrow with high expectations only to find you can only get in with tickets pre-booked on the internet. Hopeless for tourists and people of a cetain age - very frustrating. Fabulous looking building",
          "Very nice museum, very futuristic and realistic. Alert people, adult and kids about the way we treat our planet.",
          "An exclusive modern, new place with information over the origins of life and its developments throughout the eras. The future is there, of course and a 2 hour visit is a minimum time we need to see all we have to see. Next time in Rio do NOT forget to visit.",
          "Remember to buy the ticket online to make sure you get a spot as it gets very busy. Still, the ticket itself is very cheap R$10 per person (half of that if you're a student), and the exhibitions are very interesting to see! The main exhibition has a long queue, so if you want to",
          "We had an excelente time ate the Museum. The themes are very interesting and the location is very nice. There is always a exposition about tecnology and the future of our planet and they also have diferent seasonal expositions in other spaces.Its a nice museum to visit with the",
          "Nice museum! Visited on 10am and spent around 3h there. Very interesting it has several sections where you can interact with digital media and also learn about universe, environment and other things. Highly recommended.",
          "Interesting conceptual museum in a nice setting. If choosing to pay the small fee to enter, the museum provides a number of interactive attractions, culminating in a decent view over Guanabara Bay towards the Niteroi bridge. The redeveloped port area itself is a great spot to",
          "Really nice museum from the outside. We went to buy tickets but were told you can only buy them online. We didn't have our phones and not sure how I felt about buying something online so we traveled all the way there without going in. So make sure you buy your tickets ahead of",
          "It was a profound experience visiting this museum. It makes you think about the world we live in and as the human race what are doing to it. It also makes you wonder what tomorrow holds for this planet. Brits visiting this museum should feel proud as many of the scientists",
          "That museum is brand new and gives you a wide idea of how humans is devastating the planet as well the actions being put in place to recover the damaged areas. It is a interactive museum full of technology.",

          "The recent Museu do Amanha, designed by Santiago Calatrava in Rio, changed completly its surrounding area. The new addition sums to the already significant neighbourhood - MAR, Mosteiro de Sao Bento - a final touch. A must see in Rio, even if you question Calatrava's designs.",

          "I love environmentally aware projects and this is definitely one of the most stunning I've seen. The entire outer 'spine' is covered in solar cells, it is made predominantly with sustainable materials. <3 it.",
          "Went to see this as the architecture of the building was amazing couldn't buy tickets at the museum so had to go online and purchase them before been allowed in which was an ordel as no wifi. While you are given an iris which you are supposed to be able to use to translate to",
          "Long lines. Nothing interesting. Loud. Terrible signage and organization. Worst \"museum\" I have ever visited. The only positive is the cheap ticket.",
          "The museum is situated in place with amazing view and architecture and near the down town nice place worth visiting with lot of sightseeing around and easily reachable through metro line one",
          "New museum at the port region, Tomorrow Museum is not a museum of pieces of art, old art. It's more like a show of our planet and everything related to human occupation on it and how our lifestyle affects the Earth, and the impacts of global warming. Huge HD screens impacts us",
          "Building is marvelous with the Spanish Architect Calatrava as its designer. Beautiful from outside and astonishing from inside. There is a huge globe hanging on top of the second floor that is a great picture. Main room had a long line the day I visited but it worths the wait.",
          "Rio de Janeiro\u2019s new museum built in the renewed port area was a hospitality house for the Olympics. It is a novel museum that focuses on ideas rather than objects. Six major themes of future are explored: climate changes; changes in biodiversity; growing population and",

          "It is a majestic places, with many galleries. Although there was a 45 min wait to get in, as the line was huge, when you are inside you do not see the crowd. It is well planned and the view to the ocean is breathtaking. It is definitely worth.",

          "I did not have high expectations when I entered the museum as I was so overwhelmed by the architecture.To my surprise the content inside the museum was amazing. It really made me think as there was a major multimedia exhibit about what we humans are doing to our planet. They",
          "For its price tag it is a complete let down. Sure the building looks neat but inside is much like the skeletal resemblance of the building as a whole. There is nothing really of note here that is worth the admission. My advice? Just take photos of the outside and move on.",
          "This museum features a large number of interactive audio visual installations that demonstrate the cultural biological and ecological state of the world and where it is going. Several large attractions featuring multiple screens and interactive stations. Only short coming was",

          "The museum itself is an attraction , but there is more,all at a walking distance. This once decrepit area, is now full of life and I was amazed on how beautiful it became. It is worth also to visit Mar Museum, about 200 meters from this attraction, and stroll the area and if",
          "Entry free for kids and elderly. Appropriate for all ages thanks to very diverse and interactive elements: for kids, since there's so much to see, watch and even play; for adults, since in interactive elements, very detailed information. Great flow of the museum, very impressive",
          "We just had a great visit at this museum. I really recommend going. Visually, It is stunning inside and out - it is shaped like a new aged Picasso-fied whale with moving solar powered mechanical parts. On the inside you see a spacious area with a giant globe. The exhibits that",

          "The Museu do Amanh\u00e3 is the most new museum in the Rio de Janeiro city. Its architecture is at least fantastic. Its attractions are not less than very interesting. Its localization is splendid. Its neighborhood was complete reformed for the Olympics Games with new buidings and",

          "Has to be the most boring and anodyne museum I have ever visited. No exhibition, just screens and lots of them. Appears more intent on making a PC statements on global warming and population pressure than actually fully addressing the issues mankind faces - religion, conflict",
          "We only had time to visit the museum from outside. But this is spectacular. And the complete surrounding has a very nice atmosphere.",
          "It is completely different from a regular museum. I was impressed. And the view from there is difficult to discribe. You can stay there for hours just relaxing.",
          "The beauty of the building and the surroundings is amazing. The exhibits are Ok ...two are very good indeed. It is not huge which is good for children and older people. Still crowded because it is fairly new, so buy tickets online!",

          "I love this museum, but, because the big number of visitors, the wait to enter in museum and the roons is boring. To enter in the black circle, I waited more two hours, plus the two to enter in museum, oh God! Where is the tomorrow's planning?!",
          "I am a very energetic person very difficult to catch my attention for so long; all to say I get easily distracted. The idea of going to a museum is not my first option excepting when we talk about aviation. However the tomorrow's museum was totally the contrary. The message is",

          "The Museum of Tomorrow term in itself is a contradiction in terms. But the building, signed by Catalan design-architech-auteur Santiago Calavedra is breath-taking. It looks like the amazing World Trade Center Metro station in New York City's 9/11 memorial. Content is",

          "It is simply beautiful (I mean the architecture of the building as well as its location). It is really modern inside, even though there aren't that many things to see. It is a REFLECTION museum; what we've done to nature and where we want to be in the future. The Santos",
          "This mussel is unique, it is a very impressive construction and amazing location. The museum makes yourself to think more about the future. It has several interactive screens and impressive information. You will enjoy one visit to this place",

          "We made a special trip to Pra\u00e7a Maua to visit the museum, to expose our grandchildren to the most modern world class museum in South America. It was very much worth the time spent in line getting into the exhibition. The Cosmos initial video is really amazing. The exhibits",

          "The museum is fantastic! I recommend to see it on Tuesday, as you do not have to wait endlessly in line to get in. They have a lot of information available, so take time to read it. The information is available in portuguese, spanish and english. It is quite interactive.",

The museum itself is amazing as well. There are places to sit and relax as well as many vendors selling food, water, drinks and souvenirs from Brazil. We enjoyed our visit!",

          "Very well done, nice place to take your kids. It is a collection of facts about the world. Knowing how diverse is the world and the challenges that the ecosystem is facing will definitely make them a better citizens of tomorrow.\nHighlights- \u2026",

          "Big, modern building with exhibits about features of life on earth. I was a bit disappointed that the beginning of the museum \"Cosmos\" film was only in Portuguese, but the imaging is pretty spectacular and you get the general idea of what is being said.\n\nLots of modern art pieces worked into the displays and cool photo ops.",

          "Impressed! We went on a Tuesday so the entrance was free, what a great place to build your conscious of what we want to do for this planet, realized That since 1950 we are killing our planet little by little. A must go experience meantime you are in Rio!",
          "If you go on a holiday weekend or during peak season, buy tickets online ahead of time. Otherwise, you\u2019ll wait in a very long line! Most of the museum is about conservation of the earth, rather than technology as I thought beforehand.",
          "It's a very educational and interesting place with interactive screens and a globe show room on the second floor. However, if you are coming from Europe and are enjoying the outdoor options of Rio then you can miss this. There are similar ones in Europe.",

          "It is a nice museum to visit in Rio de Janeiro. The outside area is amazing, with a great view. Inside is quite small, but for the reasonable price it is worth to go. Quick tips: Buy the ticket online, as it has a huge queue for buy on there and you will save some time on your trip.",
          "Nice museum about the human expansion and the effects of it at our planet. Very interesting!",
          "Hands down one of the best museum I've visited. The current exhibition itself is so relevant for the world today, there's lots of interactivity and I wished I had another hour to spend. If there's one museum you want to visit in Rio, please go to this one. Oh, and the architecture by Santiago Calatrava by itself is also quite impressive.",

          "Beautiful Museum that talks about the future of man kind, nature, science and technology.  It also gives a brief background of planet earth's discoveries and revelations.

          "Better to visit something else. Outside is better than inside",
          "Stunning museum. Really thought provoking and all the information was displayed in English and Portugese. Innovative ways of getting the message across. Free Wi-Fi (after signing in with Facebook or google) and water fountains. Generally a good museum. Really seems like they took time and effort to display in the most effective way.",
          "Beautiful representation of humanity and how it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to care for this planet of ours. Set in a modern, beautiful building and close to the art museum.

          "Amazing place. One of the most beautiful museums in Brazil.",
          "It's ok. Much more impressive outside than inside, but still worth the visit. Just don't go on Tuesdays, even though it's free, it's not worth navigating through 600 kids.",
          "Museum say they close at 6pm, arrived at 5:05pm, they dont sell tickets after 5pm",
          "Nice place to visit if you find yourself nearby. Some stunning presentations about earth that raise awareness about our planet. \nThough it is not breathtaking as other places in Rio, so if you are on short stay, and short on time, do not waste your time",
          "Very great alternative to the typical museum. Highly futuristic and innovative take on highlighting the effects on tomorrow by today's actions. Free wifi and a coffee shop inside. Entry is free on Tuesdays for everyone and student discounts available.",
          "The were some interesting displays, although I probably wouldn't go again. The architecture is amazing. Three popcorn stands out front were good too.  They don't allow you to take in a backpack or were, but the coat check is free. Keep your entrance card on you because you use it to interact with displays.",
          "Awesome.  Could spend the whole day here!",
          "I couldn't imagine such places in Brazil, simply mixture of science and future.\nLoved it",
          "I cried in this museum. Its trying to make the people aware of how we are destroying our beautiful planet and what we need to do to help save it. Please go there and educate yourselves! Tuesdays they open for free, but I think they should open their doors for free every day of the week!",

          "The bjilding itself is an art piece in it of itself.  The exhibit I saw was also quite special and very well presented but there was too much open space there.  On one hand I can see the value in a 5 piece exhibit... Clear and to the point. \u2026",
          "Thought it was a museum of tomorrow, but it shows facts about the past & today Would not really recommend.",

          "Modern and big musuem with entertainment and learning factor. Many interactions do not make it boring for children either. \n\nTherefore, a good option for the bad weather and then, of course, the view outside is not so nice.\n\nRelatively easy \u2026",

          "An interesting museum, worth the small entry fee and educational for younger audiences",
          "The experience is great. It\u2019s like a cathedral for the universe. \n\nHowever the guy with the ridiculous mustache at the gift shop was a joke. He was \u201cworking\u201d at the register while reading a book. No not reading when there were no customers. \u2026",

          "Big focus on climate change. A nice air conditioned change of pace while in Rio. Really makes you think.",
          "An interesting museum with a gorgeous facade; there is attention to detail in every aspect of the building. The exhibition while we were in Rio feature calling attention to climate change. There is a lot of material out in the world on this \u2026",
          "Defenatly something different for the first time.",

          "Amazingly glorious, beautiful and awesome! Brazilians are great artists!",
          "A very simple yet poignant experiential collection highlighting the wonder of the earth and human species but also our impact on the fragile ecosystem. Amazing 360\u00b0 cinema and plenty of exhibits to be really engaged whilst learning. A spectacular building in itself - like some futuristic spaceship from a Final Fantasy game",

          "Interesting exhibition. Interactive tour had no English translation",
          "The neofuturistic construction and design is absolute amazing by Santiago Calatrava. There should be more hands-on museums  like this. Where we as humanity try to make a difference for our planet. We are responsible of what happens tomorrow if we don\u2019t take action. There are many exhibitions and interactive games. Very nice experience!",

          "There was some interesting things there .",
          "It's a very beautiful piece of modern architecture, located a few steps from the cruise terminal and the Brazilian Navy.

          "Best place I visited ever.",
          "The building is really impressive. Even just from the outside it is worth the visit. Located in the harbor area directly at the water. Better buy your tickets online to avoid the long queue at the entrance. After you made it in, you have \u2026",
          "Best part is the dancing fabrics, the planetarium exhibition is also really cool.",

          "The architectural design is so amazing",
          "An odd place with grand ambitions and clearly a large budget. But already some exhibits were closed and the facility was looking ragged when we visited. It's worth a visit nevertheless. The restaurant on the ground floor next to the pool is excellent. But be careful, no reentry to the museum is permitted. So get your timing right.",
          "A museum with unusual design and architecture. The building has an attractive  exterior within easy walking distance from the terminal building where the Prinsendam docked. Exhibits portray ideas of mechanical and other developments in \u2026",

          "Totally worth it.",
          "Interesting place! Unfortunately with some important things in Portuguese only (such as SIRI or IRIS or whatever and the intro video booth - the video is great and really cool by itself, but if they make it in English and play it for example once per hour, I would give them 5 stars.",
          "It was a interesting and modern experience. The only negative was the lack of English during the first presentation and the staff.",
          "Innovative Museum with an important message. Free entry one day of the week.",
          "The museum is beautiful. Beautiful exhibitions and great design and architecture. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I was expecting a science museum, where I could learn a little bit more about the country's contributions for science \u2026",

          "Small bleak distopian building with some pretty interestingly designed modular exhibits. Exhibit information lacks depth, it's more of an art museum.",
          "Went on Tuesday (free entry), but unlike what it says on the website, it actually closes at 5pm so we weren't allowed in even though we got there about half an hour earlier! We thought it closed at 6pm, and based on other people saying you \u2026",

        "wiki": "Copacabana (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\u0254pak\u0250\u02c8b\u0250\u0303n\u0250, ko-, -p\u0250-, -ka\u02c8-]) is a bairro (neighbourhood) located in the South Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is known for its 4 km (2.5 miles) balneario beach, which is one of the most famous in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe district was originally called Sacopenap\u00e3 (translated from the Tupi language, it means \"the way of the soc\u00f3s\", the soc\u00f3s being a kind of bird) until the mid-18th century. It was renamed after the construction of a chapel holding a replica of the Virgen de Copacabana, the patron saint of Bolivia. The name may be derived from the Aymara kota kahuana, meaning \"view of the lake.\" The social scientist Mario Monta\u00f1o Arag\u00f3n found in the \"archives of Indias\" in Sevilla, Spain, a different history: \"Kotakawana\" is the god of fertility in ancient Andean mythology, the equivalent to the classical Greek goddess Aphrodite or the Roman Venus. This god is androgynous and lives in the Titicaca, and his court consists of creatures (male and female) that are represented in colonial sculptures and in Catholic churches. They were called \"Umantuus\", known as mermaids in Western culture.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nCopacabana begins at Princesa Isabel Avenue and ends at Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Beyond Copacabana, there are two small beaches: one, inside Fort Copacabana and the other, right after it: Diabo (\"Devil\") Beach. Arpoador beach, where surfers go after its perfect waves, comes next, followed by the famous borough of Ipanema. The area was one of the four \"Olympic Zones\" during the 2016 Summer Olympics. According to Riotur, the Tourism Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro, there are 63 hotels and 10 hostels in Copacabana.\n\n\n== Copacabana Beach ==\nCopacabana beach, located at the Atlantic shore, stretches from Posto Dois (lifeguard watchtower Two) to Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Leme is at Posto Um (lifeguard watchtower One). There are historic forts at both ends of Copacabana beach; Fort Copacabana, built in 1914, is at the south end by Posto Seis and Fort Duque de Caxias, built in 1779, at the north end. One curiosity is that the lifeguard watchtower of Posto Seis never existed. Hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs and residential buildings dot the promenade facing Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica.  On Sundays and holidays, one side of Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica is closed to cars, giving residents and tourists more space for activities along the beach.  \nCopacabana Beach plays host to millions of revellers during the annual New Year's Eve celebrations, and in most years, has been the official venue of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. \n\n\n== Copacabana promenade ==\nThe Copacabana promenade is a pavement landscape in large scale (4 kilometres long). It was rebuilt in 1970 and has used a black and white Portuguese pavement design since its origin in the 1930s: a geometric wave. The Copacabana promenade was designed by Roberto Burle Marx.\n\n\n== Living standard ==\nCopacabana has the 11th highest Human Development Index in Rio; the 2000 census put the HDI of Copacabana at 0.902.\n\n\n== Neighbourhood ==\nAccording to the IBGE, 160,000 people live in Copacabana and 44,000 or 27.5% of them are 60 years old or older. Copacabana covers an area of 7.84 km2 which gives the borough a population density of 20,400 people per km2. Residential buildings eleven to thirteen stories high built next to each other dominate the borough. Houses and two-story buildings are rare.\nWhen Rio was the capital of Brazil, Copacabana was considered one of the best neighborhoods in the country.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nMore than 40 different bus routes serve Copacabana, as do three subway Metro stations: Cantagalo, Siqueira Campos and Cardeal Arcoverde.\nThree major arteries parallel to each other cut across the entire borough: Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica (Atlantic Avenue), which is a 6-lane, 4 km avenue by the beachside, Nossa Senhora de Copacabana Avenue and Barata Ribeiro/Raul Pomp\u00e9ia Street both of which are 4 lanes and 3.5 km in length. Barata Ribeiro Street changes its name to Raul Pomp\u00e9ia Street after the S\u00e1 Freire Alvim Tunnel. Twenty-four streets intersect all three major arteries, and seven other streets intersect some of the three.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\nOn 26 April 1949, RMS Magdalena broke in two as she was being towed into Rio de Janeiro harbour. Much of her cargo of oranges was washed up upon the beach.\nOn December 31, 1994, the New Year's Eve celebrations featured a Rod Stewart concert with an attendance of 3.5 million, making it the largest concert crowd ever. More recently, the beach has been a site for huge free concerts unrelated to the year-end festivities. On March 21, 2005, Lenny Kravitz performed there in front of 300,000 people, on a Monday night. On February 18, 2006, a Saturday, The Rolling Stones surpassed that mark by far, attracting over 1.5 million people to the beach.\nOn July 7, 2007, the beach hosted the Brazilian leg of the Live Earth concerts, which attracted 400,000 people. As the headliner, Lenny Kravitz got to play the venue a second time, with Jorge Benjor, Macy Gray, O Rappa and Pharrell as the main opening acts.\nOn October 2, 2009, 100,000 people filled the beach for a huge beach party as the IOC announced Rio would be hosting the 2016 Olympics. 11 of the 15 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups have taken place here.\nOn July 28, 2013, the beach hosted the final event of the World Youth Day 2013. About 3 million people including 3 presidents joined Pope Francis when he celebrated the holy mass.\nFrom May till July, 2014 the United Buddy Bears exhibit was held on the Copacabana promenade and attracted more than 1,000,000 people. The presentation consisted of more than 140 bear sculptures, each two metres high and designed by a different artist.\nIn August 2016, Copacabana Beach was the site of beach volleyball in the Olympic Games.\n\n\n== New Year's Eve in Copacabana ==\nThe fireworks display in Rio de Janeiro to celebrate New Year's Eve is one of the largest in the world, lasting 15 to 20 minutes. It is estimated that 2,000,000 people go to Copacabana Beach to see the spectacle. The festival also includes a concert that extends throughout the night. The celebration has become one of the biggest tourist attractions of Rio de Janeiro, attracting visitors from all over Brazil as well as from different parts of the world, and the city hotels generally stay fully booked.\n\n\n=== History ===\nNew Year's Eve has been celebrated on Copacabana beach since the 1950s when cults of African origin such as Candombl\u00e9 and Umbanda gathered in small groups dressed in white for ritual celebrations. The first fireworks display occurred in 1976, sponsored by a hotel on the waterfront and this has been repeated ever since. In the 1990s the city saw it as a great opportunity to promote the city and organized and expanded the event.\nAn assessment made during the New Year's Eve 1992 highlighted the risks associated with increasing crowd numbers on Copacabana beach after the fireworks display. Since the 1993-94 event concerts have been held on the beach to retain the public. The result was a success with egress spaced out over a period of 2 hours without the previous turmoil, although critics claimed that it denied the spirit of the New Year's tradition of a religious festival with fireworks by the sea. The following year Rod Stewart beat attendance records. Finally, the Tribute to Tom Jobim - with Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, and Paulinho da Viola - consolidated the shows at the Copacabana R\u00e9veillon.\nThere was a need to transform the fireworks display in a show of the same quality. The fireworks display was created by entrepreneurs Ricardo Amaral and Marius. From the previous 8\u201310 minutes the time was extended to 20 minutes and the quality and diversity of the fireworks was improved.

          "The Garden is quite large and is located pretty close to the heart of the city. Most of the gardens are nicely shaded because of the dense tree canopy. Bromides and air plants are everywhere. They also have both orchid and bromide houses. A wonderful and relaxing way to spend",

          "Frankly, I am flabbergasted by the positive reviews. This place is not worth going out of your way for. It is big, yes, but not well maintained. At the time we went, there was nothing in bloom, nothing special to see, except a few monkies. There are more flowers to be found just",

          "Initially I thought this was a quaint small tourist attraction, albeit a very pleasant one. As we walked through it revealed itself to be absolutely enormous! With a wealth of flora to see, the bromeliads are not to be missed and the avenue of palm trees is truly spectacular.",
          "I was very disappointed from the botanical garden. It used to be way more lively and full with birds and other animals. Today the situation is that the thing you\u2019ll see for sure is the plants and for that maybe it worth going. If not I would recommend to spend the time",

          "Not many tourists/locals will think of visiting this beautiful garden while in rio, all everybody likes to do is go to the crowded beaches and busy market areas for shopping, I prefered instead to visit this garden and it was really worth it for its beautiful tall palm trees",
          "This is a nice park and a relaxing walk. It is worth visiting. My star review is based upon many other botanical gardens that I have visited world-wide. It isn't a spectacular park but it is a nice park with a large variety of plants from around the world and the walking paths",

This wasn\u2019t a stand out, but there was plenty of interest, from the cacti garden, to waterfalls, leaf cutter ants in their natural environment, micro bees, orchids, avenues, fountains, etc. On top of that, very peaceful and",

I\u2019m sure the people here do a great job of keeping diversity alive and examples of plants found in Brazil, but frankly it\u2019s not well maintained and is possibly one of the most boring",

          "The place is big and mostly very quiet. It was a good place to go to for an easy Sunday day stroll, when the sellers of the beaches etc hassle seemed too tiring. Especially the foresty areas and the orchidea house were nice, even tho the flora itself was not our forte.",

          "I went on a tour that included the gardens and a trip to the Tijuca National Park and feel I would have been better off if I did the gardens alone so that I was not rushed through without taking in the plants and flowers. Our tour whizzed past 4 sites in the botanical gardens,",

          "The main problem is to get there, we walked by foot from a metro station, but it wasn't a pleasant walk. A bus and a taxi could be stuck in traffic. However, the garden is worth visiting if you love nature. The entrance fee is 15 reais per person right now. Closed shoes",

The cathedral is the See of the Metropolitan Archbishops of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The church is dedicated to Saint Sebastian, the patron saint of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe cathedral was designed by Edgar de Oliveira da Fonseca in a modern style based on Mayan architectural style of pyramids. The current cathedral was built between 1964 and 1979 and replaced as seat of the Archdiocese a series of churches that had served as cathedrals since 1676, the most recent and notable of those being the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel of the Ancient See, now known as the Old Cathedral, built in the 18th century, and that had been declared Rio's cathedral in the early 19th century.\nThe New Cathedral, as it is sometimes called, is located in the center of the city. Conical in form and with a 96 metres (315 ft) internal diameter \u2014 106 metres of external diameter \u2014 and an overall height of 75 metres (246 ft). Inside, the area measures 8,000 square meters and sufficient 5,000 seats(; it has a standing-room capacity of 20,000 people).\nThe cathedral's four rectilinear stained glass windows soar 64 metres (210 ft) from floor to ceiling.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOld Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Portuguese) Official site",

          "This is one of the most interesting designs I have ever seen for a Cathedral. The conical shape is inspired from the Mayan architecture style. The stained glass windows are really impressive (each one is more than 60 meters tall) and the statue of Christ appears to be hanging in",

          "They say it holds as 2,000 parishioners. The shape from the outside appears to be a Mayan pyramid and on the inside it appears to resemble the atrium of a tall hotel like the Luxor of Las Vegas. The altar is in the middle of the building and almost a 360\u00b0 seating arrangement.",
          "Not the traditional cathedral design, but certainly worth a visit. Resembling a steep sided, stepped, multi faceted pyramidal structure, more associated with the ancient civilisations of South America, the design is certainly unique. Built of grey, weathered concrete,internally",

          "Truly unusual facade for a cathedral--but the inside is the most visually striking church I have ever seen, perhaps because it is so very different from most Catholic churches. The modernist design is a feast for the eyes and the stained glass is lovely. Even if you're not much",
          "Verrrry impressive architecture and design for this marvelous wonder. No ventilation, only holes in the walls to allow air. Massive building with even more impressive vibrancy and bronze statue hanging from the ceiling with stain glass. Must see!",

          "We visited this metropolitan church as a part of the Rio downtown tour. The inside and outside are quite contrast to each other. The church looks like a mayan pyramid from outside and inside is quite nice with all the stained glass.",
          "A very different architecture and lovely cathedral to visit..outside the cathedral, there is a statue of mother Teresa which definitely worth seeing. The church itself has beautiful stained glass and a cross over the ceiling!",
          "I first visited this cathedral church in 1987. It captured me then and that interest has only grown in my subsequent four visits, most recently this past Easter Sunday. The church is different, very different, but all the more beautiful for it. Not only is it an architectural",
          "This is a strange some might say ugly building from the outside but on the inside it is incredible so worth a visit the stained glass is amazing",
          "First you don't think that this is a church. But when you enter you see it is. It's was on my path and it looked interesting so I made a quick stop there. It was nice to see but in my opinion there are other/nicer things to see in Rio",
          "This is a great stop in the center of the city, near the financial district and very close to the tram to get to Santa Teresa. We had a guide, which I think is always a good idea when you visit a cathedral. Understanding the background, the structure and the relevance of the",
          "This cathedral is not much to see from the outside but do not judge a book by its cover. We were assured by our guide that the insides would be amazing and it didn't disappoint. The cathedral has lovely architecture and we were fortunate to have the treasures of the setting sun",
          "Visited this modern place of worship it is built for the weather a beautiful breeze naturally flows through the building it is shaded from the blazing sunshine to make it a place of comfort.",
          "Looks a bit like a wigwam than a traditional cathedral. Allegedly housed 20000 people for visits of the last two Popes, so very large. Similar in style to Liverpool's Catholic Cathedral in UK. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, unless it was for religious reasons.",
          "The Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Sebastian located nearby city center is a landmark of modern art. The stained glass windows are amazing and each one tells you a story so a guide is highly reccommended. Worth a visit",
          "Visited this when on my Scenic Tour of South America, looks like a Mayan Pyramid on the outside, the tall stained glass windows on the inside illuminate the inside of this unorthodox church, worth a visit I reckon.",
          "Wow. You have to visit this place if nothing else but to appreciate the unusual architecture. The cathedral has many seats but when removed 20,000 people can be inside. Wow. The stained glass windows are amazing and trying to snap the perfect photo was challenging with so many",
          "I\u2019ve always wanted to see this church since it usually appears in those lists of \u2018most unusual churches\u2019. It\u2019s like a truncated cone shape. If you want a hotel with an excellent view of this church I would recommend Hotel Carioca and request a room with a view.",
          "I visited this cathedral as part of a tour by C2 Rio tours. This cathedral is a modern design based on Mayan architectural style of pyramids. It was built between 1964 and 1979. The cathedral has natural cooling and lighting. The cathedral is huge with a 106 m diameter and a",
          "It is definitely one of the most interesting Cathedrals and architectures I have ever visited. From outside it doesn\u2019t look like a religious place at all. The inside is colorful with beautiful glass windows.",
          "This place is strange, i mean that from the outside it doesnt look like catholic church, more like some pyramid. In the night very ugly green light makes it look like some very old fablric from computer games.. In the inside its not as bad. Its super big inside",
          "This is a a very modern building - a conical structure which does not look at all like a church - but when you get inside it is simply stunning. The interior is cool, spacious and decorated with beautiful stained glass representations of biblical scenes. Well worth a visit",
          "Went there as we often visit churches, even though we do not consider ourselves religious, but there is a lot of history in churches. Walking towards this one it looks special, almost like a pyramide. And actually not very inviting. But close up, at the very wide main entrance",
          "The special conic and pyramid shape of the Metropolitan Cathedral which is based on the Maya architecture looks awkward and unattractive on the outside, but this feeling disappears once you are inside. The church breathes an intimate, cosy atmosphere and that is mainly due to",
          "This building is impressive for its size. The stained glass windows are again very large and ok, but the rest of the architecture is atrocious. The building is a huge conical concrete structure and really isn't attractive at all. I'd call in if near but not take too much of a",
          "This cathedral is a must see. The stained glass is exquisite and rises up to the ceiling from the floor. The Mayan architecture is unique with a cross in the ceiling meeting four columns of stained glass.Gregorian chants were playing when I went, adding to the peace and beauty",
          "Did this with a city tour so must of the tours go here. It's a quick stop and from outside looks like a pyramid but inside is very nice and detailed. Quick photos and go",
          "What where they thinking one can't help to wonder. Niemeyer-inspired building, impressive proportions and measurements, beautiful stained glass windows. Architectural curiosity. Funny combo of \"socialism meets catholicism\" - the Lenin mausoleum wouldn't feel out of place in here",
          "which is on most walking tours (free) or can be sought out if you are in Centro or Lapa. Be careful of Lapa though, shady characters throughout!",
          "Gloomy from the outside but impressive from inside - this church is interesting for a short visit while in the area.",
          "An interesting example of modernist architecture, and very different from any other church I've seen in South America. My first association was with the Basilica of Guadalupe, although there were built by different architects. As others said, it is big, free and quiet as there",
          "You'd never guess that this conical-shaped building was a church from the outside. My first thought that came to mind was of the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, architecturally speaking. Completed in 1979 at a height of 246 feet high, the concrete behemoth can seat 5,000 or",
          "While at the Sugar Loaf mountain, get a veiw of the building that is behind the cathedral. You can see the Cross shape of this building so distinctly. You can also see the cathedral from the top of the Sugar Loaf on a clear day.",
          "Very unique cathedral that is beautiful. It is within walking distance of the Escadaria Selaron, Lapa Arches, and in the middle of the centro district. It was free to enter. It was quite and there were only a few other visitors. They have a small gift shop with souvenirs and",
          "What makes this stop at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Rio is the interesting, unique architectural style that was used to create it. Rising like a conical pyramid/bee hive into the skyline of Rio. The inside is a huge open space with stained glass windows around the outside.",
          "Religions apart, that's a great place to visit. The architecture is amazing from the outside and from the inside. Acoustics are very interesting and the surroundings are also good for tourism. Make sure you go in and explore before going to Lapa, which is 5 minutes walking",
          "We booked a day tour of Rio and had no idea we would see this gem on our route. Definitely worth the visit, the pictures do not do it justice. It is in the middle of the town and welcome to all visitors.",
          "Our Tour guide took us to see this unusual cathedral on our whirl wind tour of Rio de Janeiro. It is incredibly tall, plain looking on the exterior, almost pyramid/Aztec in shape. Felt very cool inside with huge stained glass windows on all sides, quite beautiful when looking up",
          "This cathedral has a very unique architecture. The staining glasses windows are beautiful from inside. Do go into the cathedral to take a look. But it will only take you about 15 - 20 minutes to look around and take photos as a visitor.",
          "Definitely worth visiting and short meditation inside. The architecture is unique enough to surprise even the most travelled visitors. No entry fee, but there are some access limitations due to active Mass services on Sundays",
          "Nice old cathedral that is typically dark but has interesting architecture. This was part of our city tour and was a good visit.",
          "Loved this Cathedral, it really is like no other we've been to. Incredibly austere yet beautiful in a severe sort of way. Even the exterior is so different, a huge almost pyramidical structure. So modern. The crucifix inside is magnificent. So arresting and striking. The place",
          "This building is unusual and appears to be quite plain if unusual outside. Inside it is a revelation and the light filters in from one side as the sun moves round. Capable of seating many it merits a visit even if you don't like churches.",
          "Place this on your list of things to do in Rio. The architecture inside and out is astonishing. You can see the altar from anywhere in the cathedral. The ceiling is entirely supported by the four walls that rise up like a pyramid. Somewhere around 20,000 parishioners can be",
          "Wierd pyramid looking building. Nice stained glass. Best part was the reflection in the building across the street. I liked the old cathedral better",
          "impressed with this modern art 1975 design of this unique cone-shaped structure with a capacity of 20,000 people standing or as usually configured 5,000 seated. A Mass was ongoing, with the bishop officiating, although none was on the schedule for that afternoon.",
          "Pyramidal grey building from the exterior that does not refer to the beautiful interior which also inspires greatness and holiness it is a must see",
          "If you have a few extra minutes, this unusual and rather enormous cathedral is worth a look. Admission is free",
          "My personal impression from the cathedral was rather dissatisfying. I found it dark and dirty-looking. But don't be fooled. The unusual style of architecture should be very inspiring - if you find a correct time to visit it. Some hints: Look for the time when the sun shines",
          "Stained glass panels inside the church form a cross on the ceiling. Jesus is skillfully hung from the ceiling. Free to visit, and you can take as many photos as you want. Not a lot of tourists here. Statues inside are nice. Pews traditional and wooden. Quick visit while in Rio,",
          "I liked this Cathedral from the outside in an intriguing sort of way, but I really loved it from the inside, striking and well worth seeing. 4 stained glass panels over 30 feet tall each form a cross on the ceiling. Jesus is artfully hung from the ceiling and is in the middle",
          "Visited here as part of a excursion around Rio, the one thing you can say it is clearly different form any other RC cathedral we have ever seen. To us it looked similar to a pyramid or an Aztec temple but it is certainly stunning and eye-catching. The inside is quite",
          "This building is out of the expected structure we are used to for a Christian Cathedral and really deserve the visit. Built up in 1979 by Edgar Fonseca architect, it looks like a huge facetted cone cut on the top. Inside , the 30t high celeing allows the colored glass",
          "There is a wide range of opinion about the appearance of the cathedral. Some compare the structure to a pyramid, especially of the South American style. Other has said it resembles a nuclear power plant. Whichever view you agree with, you will be amazed by the internal",
          "This church is often included in a tour of the city and its architecture is meant to represent a Mayan temple. There are great stained glass windows to see inside and entrance is free but by donation. Worth a visit for 20 minutes or so.",
          "Based on a Mayan pyramid this building allows fresh air to circulate around this structure keeping the 5000 worshippers cool. The stained glass is quite impressive and provides a great photo opportunity. The glass fronted building opposite provides a great reflection of the",
          "This concrete cathedral is built like a pyramid with open air entrances. Definitely a must see place. The stained glass and lighting is awesome. There is a statue of pope in one of the openings. This cathedral symbolizes unity of people and is open to weddings. The concrete",
          "When we arrived it looked dour and plain. The inside of the cathedral was brilliant. It was a Sunday morning and communion was being served but did not stop viewing the inside. The flowers were beautiful on the altars and the stainless glass windows stunning. Apparently they",
          "this cathedral is very impressive, the glass work is stunning and it is breathtaking, there is a carriage used by the portuguese when Brazil was a colony, try if you can to attend mass as you accoustic is impressive",
          "This doesn't look like a church but like some kind of pyramidal cement structure. Wait 'til you walk through the decorated doors and gaze on the huge stained glass windows inside. Cross of Christ over the altar is intriguing. A beautiful place to visit.",
          "Cool looking Cathedral. We weren't here long, we just stopped for a couple minutes on our tour Rio so we couldn't really take in that much. Looks like a typical Church from the inside but it does have a very interesting cone structure to the building.",
          "Outstanding if interested in modern style big churches, 4 large, really large colored glass wall/ceilings, working church.",
          "I'm not a big fan of cathedrals but this is unique. It's not that old and contains four large stained glass windows plus an overall capacity of around 5,000. A superb building which left me amazed",
          "I am not sure how I feel about this religious place. In a way I find it very innovative and even provocative, in not her way, the design would have been more appropriate as a concert hall, or exposition place. I love the stain windows, but I think inside is too cold and aseptic",
          "Looks very impressive in pictures. Outside, it felt dark and has no tranquility charm churches usually have. Fortunately, it only takes 5 minutes to see this place and is anyway in the Historic city you will be walking around. Nothing to go out of the way to see or photograph.",
          "Yes it's a big church, so it's impressive, but then? I think it's really dark inside and for me it's just a tourist trap and no more a church!",
          "Pyramidal cathedral with tiered belltower sitting beside it. Doorways on all four sides. Looks unprepossessing until you go in, being immediately struck by the splendid glass windows, which are not obvious from the outside. Apparently sits 4,000 and has room for further 8,000",
          "This cathedral feautures interesting architecture & has beautiful floor to ceiling stained glass windows. It also has an art gallery. It was featuring an exhibit on the Shroud of Turin while we were there",
          "Ultra modern, brutalist architecture - just like the Sydney opera house inside - heaps of exposed concrete. However here there are four amazing stained glass windows floor to top of a hollow spire and a suspended crucifix. We visited on a Sunday so quite lovely to see mass in",
          "Many find this Cathedral structure weird but I simply loved it! It was inspired by the Mayan pyramids and I just love that two religious structures can be integrated so beautifully. It's nice to see designers move away from the standard mould and create something new and",
          "The exterior structure of the church seem a bit rustic, but the interior is just gorgeous. With organ music in the background, this spacious, high ceiling church is calming. Four gigantic stain glass windows on 4 directions were very unique. Great place to just sit and reflect.",
          "Situated in central Rio, the cathedral,if anything, looks a little out of place. It is basically in the shape of a pyramid, reminiscent of Mayan temples seen, for example, in Mexico but given it was only built 60 odd years ago, is obviously quite modern. It is quite some",
          "Stunning! Not traditional. Very modern. Beautiful! The building stands out, like Barcelona's Sagrada Familia. When you go out of the Cathedral look at the sky scraper in front - the cathedral reflects there.",
          "Rather bland exterior, but beautiful modern stained glass inside, which with the tranquil music makes for a very peaceful way of spending 15 minutes or so. Lots of tours stop here for 15 - 20 minutes.",
          "What a Cathedral! Very interesting architecture. I loved the interior of the Cathedral - huge, amazing vitrages and great atmosphere!",
          "This is a stunner! Didn't know much about it but so glad we visited. Like many sights of Rio it has that \"down to earth at the same time as being out of this world\" character. Worshippers and tourists mingle happily in and out of the huge concrete tent. It's free to wander in",
          "Was taken here by tour guide on a recent trip around Rio - had not heard of this landmark before. From the outside this is a big dour concrete building. The wow factor is when you walk in the door - the floor to ceiling stain glass windows and the scale of the internal space is",
          "The cathedral was designed by Edgar Fonseca in a modern style of pyramids. It is 315 ft internal diameter with a height of 246 ft. and 5,000 seats. 30 minute visit for picture. The cathedral's four rectilinear stained glass windows soar 64 metres (210 ft) from floor to",
          "Visited the cathedral as part of a tour. Amazing stained glass inside. It takes 20000 people standing so it is huge. Newly built for a popes visit. Worth the visit as part of a tour. 15 minutes should be enough. Interesting bell tower outside and good reflection photos in",
          "We got a last-minute call from other friends who were in Rio suggesting that this was a must-see and we are so glad they called. The Cathedral is modern and different but that's what makes it stunning. Beautiful, huge stained glass windows, and many other features.",
          "It's so great to see some different church architecture and that is a genuine stunning (if a bit concrete) design with amazing high stained glass windows.",
          "Edgar Fonseca was inspired by the ancient Mayan pyramids to design this very modern cathedral. The cathedral's four rectilinear stained glass windows soar from floor to ceiling culminating in a cross centered 210 feet above the floor. Each stained glass panel represents one of",
          "I am sort of shrined and churched out from my previous vacations, so I was only planning on going here if I had time. I ended up here because I could not find the other attractions I was hoping to go to, so I decided to work backwards. I am happy that I went. The church is",
          "Far too modern for my church architectural tastes but a good place to have a quiet sit and contemplate life in Rio away from the bustle of Centro district. Even so, I think Mayan-style pyramids are more suited to Mexico and Guatemala - personal taste.",
          "An awesome Cathedral; well worth visiting for the vastness and architecture alone. And of course, quiet reflection if you are religious.",
          "Very impressive architecture and building. The location is good, and very good to turn around for different views. Do not miss it!!!",
          "This amazing building is a \"must see\" for everyone visiting Rio de Janeiro. A very moving experience. The windows are incredible.",
          "\"Unique\" architectural but the meaning of \"unique\" sometimes has positive meaning and sometimes has negative meaning. Every visitor will decide about the meaning of \"unique\" in this case. It is recommended to go inside and to admire the fabulous windows with stained glass.",
          "From the top of Sugarloaf we could see the cathedral, and it just looked so odd, so out of place among all of the modern buildings around it. It was on our tour's itinerary so we went along of course. Upon arrival standing at the front with your back to the cathedral you notice",
          "A delight to see how the problem of creating soaring light can be created out of concrete combined with a post Lateran 2 approach to making the mass equally accessible to all by putting seating in a circle. The mediaeval cathedral builders especially English perpendicular with",
          "How could this got 4.5 stars? We came across during sightseeing stop but this cathedral is definitely wasted time and not worth for a visit. Architecture is terrible & inside is it dark only. Absolutely nothing to see! Don't go.",
          "This cathedral is a surprise waiting to be discovered. The architect designed it with hundreds of openings to the outside that slant downward to keep rain out but let fresh air in. The stained glass windows are stunning and the way the pews are configured in a circular manner is",
          "What a cool cathedral! It's located in downtown Rio, so a quick stop if you're there already. The building was constructed to allow for \"natural air conditioning\" (or so I'm told) and had beautiful stained glass panels on each side. Never seen a cathedral like it.",
          "We visited the Cathedral in April, the stained glass windows are incredibly beautiful. From the outside, there isn't much to see but inside the architecture is amazing. It seemed very popular with tourists, and locals. Definitely worth visiting whilst staying in Rio.",
          "what an amazing church in the middle of office buildings , reminded me of a pyramid when you stand in the interior , amazing stained glass windows that are nearly floor to ceiling on all 4 sides .",
          "This cathedral appears to be a standard stop on most of the Rio day tours and is a worthwhile one. Visually it dominates the surrounding streetscape- though the soaring petrochemical company skyscrapers close by now compete. We first visited 8 years ago when the outside didn't",
          "An odd building, this; surrounded by a car park and office buildings. The outside does not inspire much hope but the inside is unique. The stained glass windows are extraordinary and the entire space inspiring. The little exhibition in the corner is all in Portuguese.",
          "The Metropolitan Cathedral is a must see stop while in Rio. The Cathedral's architecture can't be described with words but be sure to visit the gallery in the left rear of the cathedral. I suggest spending at least 20 minutes here if possible.",
          "This thing looks kind of like a cylindrical piece of poo from the outside based on its bland brown appearance. When I first got out of the car, I was like good grief this is ugly, but the inside of it is so mesmerizing that the outside looks pretty on the way out if that makes",
          "frrom the outside a strange building. Seems to be inspired by aztec temples. From the inside very impressive.",
          "It looks like a pyramid from the outside but it is amazing on the inside, with colourful stained glass. The ambience is good- quiet and peaceful.",
          "Very interesting architecture, reminds the Mayan peramids with amazing 64 entered high colourful glass columns. Great place for taking photos. Not only for religious visits... I'm totally not.",
          "Lights up different colors in the evening. We passed by it during our walk around noon and went inside for a quick look. Nice, cool, and quiet inside.",
          "Good to stop by to take pic during the day and night. Both views are pretty. Must take pic inside the church. The mosaic windows are unique and beautiful. Reminder - Some homeless lives under the bridge. Just be careful when you walk by that area at night.",
          "I liked it.Unusual but has the spirit to encourage transcendent contemplation.Rises 246 ft and seats 5000 I believe.I enjoyed the peace and solitude.",
          "The construction is of simple concrete blocks to form a vertical cone shell. This then has long thin stain glass windows at the 4 cardinal compass points. There are also open doorways at these points and these provide free \"air-conditioning\". Above the central altar hangs a",
          "This is a surprising cathedral, round and very high. The outside looks like a round pyramid and the inside is huge. I think it is a nice cathedral to visit and it gives a new perspective of what could look like a cathedral.",
          "I think the cathedral is interesting for religious or in religions interested people. In comparison to cathedrals in Europe it is not overloaded with magnificent artifacts, rather minimalistic but enough for its function. Part of many Rio tours.",
          "So this church is not a looker on the outside, but oh boy! The stain glass inside is AMAZING!!! I was happy to stop by and see this church! I'd recommend stopping by.",
          "What a surprise this was. Not a great fan of the conrete building era but you have to give them credit for the clever disgiuse of the stained glass windows coming from the 4 stations of the cross in the roof. So glad we had a quick stop here as part of a day tour and the",
          "An immense space that can seat over 5,000 people. A 1960s modern building with huge stained glass walls.",
          "I had seen so many churches in Europe, Asia, North and South America, and this one definitely is different and intriguing. Its a modern structure but kept some mayan look. The exterior is boring and gray but when you entered you will be amazed. The stain glass went all the way",
          "From the outside it is just another building, but only when one enters inside one would figure our how majestic this building is! not just a place of worship, not just a tourist attraction but a place where one can feel the inner peace at the feet of God.",
          "This is a church that I've never seen before. When I saw it from the outsight, I wanted to see it from the inside. It's big and space full. The roof is cool with different colors but I think it's the best to visit the church when something religious is going on",
          "The lead light panels are amazing, it is a huge building, but to my mind a terrible waste of money - it rises so high, but all this space is just wasted as there is only seating at the bottom. This was built for one of the Popes that finally visited this very Catholic nation.",
          "Beautiful church. We weren't going to go there but our guide suggested it and we were glad he did. Beautiful! Have your guide tell you how it was built with natural air conditioning. Then have your guide point out the building across the street that becomes a cross when",
          "The Cathedral is a must visit place in Rio. The Cathedral though modern is stunning with the windows providing fantastic colours inside. Small park out front with a statue of current Pope which gives a good photo chance.",
          "We called in not thinking it would be so beautiful when you see the outside. Once inside, the feeling of calm was matched by the feeling that the building was open to the world with massive entrances. The 4 stained glass panels stretch from the roof to floor extending the cross",
          "As with so many things in Rio, a surprise. This building looks very much like a solid structure, but is as open and soaring on the inside as any Catholic church. Four large stained glass windows cascade down the sides of the pyramid and are of novel design. Certainly worth a",
          "Enormous open area with stained glass windows down the sides. I've never seen a church like this. Really striking.",
          "From the outside it looks quite ugly - it cannot get worse. But when you come inside you are positively surprised about the beauty, the hight of the cathedral and the light coming though the many mosaik vindows.",
          "Sadly, we just couldn't get any enjoyment from this cathedral, either spiritually or architecturally.",
          "This is off the sights you should see even if your not religious. The cathedral is located easily in central of Rio. No access fees or nothing. There are doorways at all sides of the pyramid so you can just walk thru the building. There is a tourist police onsite. It looks",
          "So when you see this building from the outside it reminded me of the Luxor hotel in Vegas. But when you get inside it is stunning...Stained class columns of windows that soar to the roof, ornate statues.. very impressive. Worth a visit if it is part of a city tour you are on.",
          "Interesting to go look inside and take a peep at the architects mind. Part of Rio Free Walking Yellow Tour. Just do the tour and you can get to see this. This was apparently voted one of the ugliest building from the exterior in Rio. The cathedral inside is HUGE. Can house about",
          "I am not a great fan of concrete, which is here in abundance. The outside is therefore pretty grim. On the other hand the inside is pretty amazing. A single unsupported huge space and lovely glazing. The natural breeze flowing through the space is an extra bonus.",
          "very interesting architecture, environment and atmosphere, regardless of your religious tendency. most interesting. don't miss.",
          "It is difficult to know how to rate this. It is not a building that takes the breath away as some of the ancient European cathedrals do, and there is not a lot to actually see, but yet it is a highly functional design - and isn't that what places of worship really ought to be?",
          "Very unique cathedral. Loved the stained glass windows. And when looking at its reflection in the skyscrapers of downtown Rio, it really does appear to look like an Aztec building. Very interesting architecture.",
          "Wiki and the guide books tell us that the 'new' cathedral was designed by Edgar Fonseca in \"a modern style based on Mayan architectural style of pyramids\". Another Tripadvisor calls the style \"brutalist\". I can see where he's coming from! It is a huge structure, 106m diameter",
          "This is such a unique and beautiful Cathedral. Catedral Metropoliyana de Sao Sebastiao also known as the Metropiltan Cathedral, it's beauty is evident once you enter the church. It is situated in the city of Rio de Janeiro and it would be interest to anyone visiting this city.",
          "A very refreshing visit to a church that wasn't over the top with opulence. Went as a part of tour group.Worth a visit.",
          "this rare downtown gem is a site that you need to see to appreciate. the shape of the building itself is intriguing and architecturally unique. once inside however, the views of the north, south, east and west stained glass columns are breathtaking and the pictures do not do",
          "If you're a fan of brutalist architecture then this is worth visiting. We loved it and though from the outside it doesn't look the most inspiring of buildings, inside is where the magic happens. Stunning stained glass and an ingenious design.",
          "Just driving past this cathedral, I thought it was an office building. It certainly doesn't look like your average cathedral. But, go inside. It is very unique and beautiful in its own way.",
          "An absolute must see . This cathedral is exceptional ! And only a short walk from Escadaria Selaron. Add this to your itinerary :)",
          "This cathedral is of a similar style to the Catholic Cathedral in Liverpool, but much larger. The windows are stunning, allowing the colours to light the inside. It is big inside and not like a traditional cathedral, well worth a visit.",
          "This cathedral is like a big big cone, stunning, wonderful unique Staines, you won't believe it, stunning. You can take photos and stay as long as want. Don't take tour just get in local taxi so so cheap, costs nothing.",
          "This a very interesting and unique Cathedral, i never saw such a design of a Cathedral with beautiful and interesting vitrage . It's allowed to take pictures inside.",
          "The Church from the outside is similar to Liverpool. Inside the Stained Glass is very good. They claim there ia seating for 5000 and standing room for 20000.",
          "I was with a group tour and our first stop was at this church. You just need to step inside and take a few quick photos.",
          "Not your traditional cathedral style, very modern although finished until in late 1970's. Very striking from outside and in with large stained glass windows from floor to ceiling. Museum on lower ground floor and small gift shop at entrance. No entrance fee but donations box",
          "After seeing so many cathedrals filled with golden opulence, this was an amazing break from tradition. Shaped like a pyramid, the interior is simple and elegant with towering stained glass windows done in a very modern style.",
          "Stunning modern interior with plenty of stained glass, spacious and impressive. Not your typical church.",
          "Coming from Las Vegas in a parish that does not yet have a church, this was a true eye-opener. The photos that I took will be given to our pastor as a possible model for our New church.",
          "It is a truncated cone, over 20 stories high, with no windows. It is a massive structure of concrete, very 60's architecture. From the religious point of view, you can imagine a place that holds thousands of people with no A/C in a tropical climate.As a Catholic, I go there and",
          "Baby Churro was wandering past in a funk when this building appeared in the distance. It looked like an Amerindian version of 1960s Brutalist architecture. Poked a nose in for a look - it is very beautiful on the inside. You should poke your nose in too.",
          "If you are close by, then go for it. If not, you aren't missing anything. Inside it's very tall and has some cool modern stain glass windows. That's about it. Sleazy gift shop at the exit. Tourist trap x10",
          "It was on the tour plan so I went. And I was so glad I did. None of your gold leaf coverings, absurdly ornate furnishings that other cathedrals / churches (particularly in Rome) have but a simple, modern design that really caught my imagination. The four, differently coloured",
          "The cathedral has a unique architecture, very fresh space and it has a wonderful and colorful decoration with glasses.. Recommended for visiting and pray some minute ;)",
          "Finished about 1979, this church possess all the charm of a giant cement plant, with a scattering of color due to the windows. The church seems to be stuck between traditional and quasi-modern, but then Rio is like that, many old colonial buildings sandwiched between modern",
          "Rio's cathedral is an amazing work of modern architecture, being outstanding, very different from the European ones. Worth a visit. You can go there by subway (metr\u00f4 Carioca station)",
          "Couldn't believe that a Church can look like this. It's an impressive structure. But the outside is rather freaky with bad characters roaming about the complex. You wouldn't feel safe over here. In fact, you are not safe in Rio at all.",
          "it takes a minute to figure out how to access the entrance gate, but once you enter the grounds there is a serene peace here.",
          "We had driven past this unique and intriguing structure a couple of times during our stay and decided to take the time to visit the interior. It really is striking; unlike any other cathedral I have ever visited. Truly remarkable stained glass windows. A feeling of tremendous",
          "This cathedral does not look like much from the outside. It would not have looked much from the inside either if it was not for the tall, floor to ceiling, stained glass panels which really added color to this otherwise drab and concrete structure.",
          "Apparently this cathedral isn't very popular with many residents but I thought it was beautiful. The stained glass panels from the top of the building to the floor that form a cross are spectacular. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Sebastian, the patron Saint of Rio de",
          "This is my 2nd visit. At first time, on the way to this church, I met a shower pouring down. Without an umbrella, I had no choice. Just got wet~ What I did in this church was, sitting on a seat and drying myself.(Waiting for being dried) I was amazed how it looked inside then.",
          "OK, it's not the most beautiful cathedral you will ever seen. Its architecture is really weird and vast. But once you reach the inside, you will find an amazing interior that will leave you speechless! Worth it to pay a visit!",
          "There are many interesting places to visit in Rio and if you are a fan of churches, then this is worth a visit. The outside of the building looks unusually modern but the inside is beautiful with stained glass of different colors on the four walls.",
          "This is an amazing and unexpected sight, from the unique structure to the gorgeous stained-glassed panels, to the open soaring expanse of the interior with the crucifix suspended above the alter. I especially enjoyed the modern interpretation of St. Francis at one of the",
          "From the outside it looks like a Mayan temple so I wasn't sure what to expect. Once inside I was won over ...stunning! The 4 Stained glass windows inside run the height of the building and meet in a central cross. A display of small Nativity scenes from different countries had",
          "Many people think in Brasilia when it comes to modern architecture in Brazil, however there are many more places worth seeing, among which the metropolitan cathedral in Rio. Come in and look to the ceiling and the beautiful work on the vitreaux. Really nice to sit down and enjoy",
          "It is really a strange shape and design for a Church, but that's why it is so interesting. It is made entirely of concrete blocks, which are cracked in numerous places so it looks neglected. The inside is very nice thanks to four narrow walls made in stained glass from bottom to",
          "Well, it is definitely the strangest cathedral I have visited in my life. I am not a big fan of the outside but once inside, it is quite impressive thanks to the light and colours of the windows.. a must see anyway in Rio de Janeiro.",
          "Great to see that some places still look great. Lovely atmosphere in the cathedral itself Don't know what else to say rather then great",
          "Not a spectacular cathedral by European standards. The Chechen Itza pyramid inspired architecture is interesting but pretty plain exterior. (struck me as strange that a pagan temple that had human sacrifices would be the inspiration for a sacred Catholic church). The stained",
          "I like this type of modern architecture from the outside, but the inside is simply amazing. You walk in and it's a vast space. And the you see thcan huge four stained glass windows, just breath taking. Be careful when you leave the cathedral, we walked away through the near",
          "The architecture of this building is amazing as is the stained glass inside. Huge glass building surround and reflect the image of the church from many angles. Definitely worth a stop imho.",
          "I visited this cathedral during a three day trip to Rio and to be honest if our guide hadn't persuaded us to go in we probably wouldn't have bothered as it looks pretty boring from the outside- a bit 60ish and lots of dirty looking concrete blocks However how wrong can you be-",
          "The inside of this Cathedral is precious. The ceiling is veeery high and the tinted windows are so beautiful that it's hard to refrain from taking pictures. Not a place to stay for a long time but certainly beautiful.",
          "This cathedral is very different from the ones I've seen before - the architecture is modern and the stained glass compliments the interior majestically. It is a must to visit!",
          "This cathedral was amazing ! No lights, no air conditioning, but a magnificent work of art. holds 4000 people and 3 poes said mass here !!",
          "The outside of this Cathedral is nothing too spectacular, but the inside is remarkable. The stained glass is beautiful and the architecture amazing.",
          "Our visit was an add-on of our vist of Sugar loafmountain, but it was definatly worth it. Having seen some very nice and different churches around the world this one fits right in. From the outside it doesn't look like a church, but more like concrete store\"thing\". But once",
          "Something very modern and very different. In a continent where churches are grand affairs, some very beautiful baroque and rococo, this stands out as its so different. The stain glass is amazing",
          "What a structure Its remarkable how the human mind thinks to design and construct buildings of this nature. From the outside and on standing looking up at the glass panels on the inside its a wonderful thing to see.",
          "Beautiful, clever concrete art. Wonderful stained glass, 12 stations of the cross - all modern - and then a statue of St Sebastian in a white carriage Katie Price would approve.... defy you not to smile at the juxtaposition.",
          "From the outside the building is an eye-sore..but inside, wow. Free entry to this modern stain glass window spectacle. Very beautiful and not like any church I've seen.",
          "Have never seen a Cathedral like this around the world. It is huge (20,000 people capacity) and built like a pyramide. Beautiful natural lighting through the vitrauxs.",
          "This is a great quick stop on your tour in Rio. The cathedral is very pretty and the architecture is unique. It wont take you more than 30 minutes to walk around and enjoy the building.",
          "I was on a sightseeing tour that stopped her. It is a special catedral and absolut somting to visit.",
          "We arrived at the start of the Sunday Morning service and although Roman Catholic, and we are Church of England, found the service enchanting and the welcome from the officiants a pleasure.",
          "The Catedral was an unexpected hit on our day tour. From the outside, it towers in a stocky, brutalist kind of way. Inside, you understand the genius of good architecture and inspired ideas. You don't need to stay long, but don't miss it either.",
          "I liked spacious place, vitrages, and special atmosphere inside. It's hard to explain... It magnets you to stay inside even if you are not religious person.",
          "Absolutely one of the strangest cathedrals I have ever been in, but still a beautiful sight. Great stained glass & architecture.",
          "I've never seen a church like this before--or any other building for that matter. I loved the stained glass windows. And the structure allowed for wonderful cooling breezes. It was worth the look and the trip.",
          "The visit here was part of a city tour. The building was certainly thought provoking shape for a church. The Cathedral could not be appreciated until you entered it. At 96 meters internally unsupported it is magnificent. The natural light filters in through slits in the outside",
          "The building is modern and different. Worth the ride because the region is very interesting, a mixture of old and new!",
          "The Catedral Metropolitana de Sao Sebastiao do Rio De Janeiro in Rio is a strange building. Located downtown in Centro, it looks somewhat like a sandcastle that was built by children on the beach! However it is strangely beautiful. The interior is lovely with the four large",
          "This is the modern Cathedral and it's difficult to take photo on this spaceship like shape. It's amazing to see inside and how too the tinted glass rise above in the cathedral. A place should not be missed and don't forget to say a prayer!",
          "Lovely modern church with beautiful venetian glasses n modern building like maya pyramids. Could be intersting to visit",
          "Even though it might look austere from outside, it is actually quite nice to visit inside with 4 bug beautiful tainted glasses and a hanging cross. A recommended sight in Rio!",
          "Built to only use natural light this cathedral is fantastic. It is worth a quick stop to take a few photos inside of the glass walls and stained glass murals.",
          "The church has a very nice architecture that allows it to use almost no electric power to light the interns. It was nice but not really impressive for a guy that lives in Rome. I especially liked the two buildings in front of the Cathedral. They are twin buildings made of glass",
          "Aesthetics not the best outside, but its pretty cool inside! Located in the heart of Rio, close to Lapa...this \"Predio\" show you how different, diverse and artistic is the Brazilian Culture! It's an interesting statement from the arquitect",
          "From the outside I didn't expect to be blown away by the beautiful interior and massive windows on the inside. It really looks spectacular, its a great place to sit down in the cool shade that the Cathedral offers. While this isn't a place you can spend a whole lot of time at I",
          "Went on a city tour and this was one of the stops. Looking at the design on the outside of the building is amazing. Looking up at it you would think that you are in ancient Egypt. On the inside it was spectacular seeing all the stained glass windows and each one has a story",
          "We didn't realize that this building was a cathedral before we came really close. The architecture is somewhat brutalistic. When you get inside you see the beautiful stained glass window and you get a totally different feeling. Worth a visite.",
          "This is a fascinating building that looks very much like an Aztec temple. It definitely does not fit the mold a typical Catholic cathedral. The inside is cavernous and dark. The stunning feature is the four sided stained glass window construction which sweeps upward and form",
          "Even if you are not religious you are going to enjoy this Cathedral. Its unconventional architecture and the huge glass panels will impress you.",
          "In the swinging 1960s, Rio\u2019s archbishop, Cardinal Camara, wanted to retire the dusty old Rococo cathedral, N. Sra. do Carmo, and replace it with a shiny new one representing modern times. The resulting Catedral de Sao Sebastiao opened its doors for business in 1979. Modern his",
          "amazing modern architecture.. huge place... i really wanted to attend a mass there but the time was a bit tight .. MUST be VISITED",
          "We visited here on a tour and it is so unconventional to other cathedrals I have visited. It is shaped like an Aztec temple with 4 amazing stained glass windows that met at the top of the roof to meet a white glass cross. Thoroughly recommended if visiting the Centro area of",
          "This is one special Cathedral, it's strange/interesting from the outside but once you step in you feel this calmness, you look up and enjoy the stained glass letting just enough light in, love going there and including this in my Centro tour (whenever friends or family visit).",
          "Very bizarre place. We'd walked past several times before even realising that that was the cathedral (having not seen a photo before). Imagine a cross between a Dalek, a Mayan pyramid and a block of flats designed in the 70's and you're halfway there. However, once you take a",
          "This cathedral is of a truly unique design. The church is dedicated to Saint Sebastian, the patron saint of Rio de Janeiro and is supposed to be a modern representation of a Mayan pyramid. The fresh air enters trough layered openings that are designed to let air in but not",
          "On my first day in Rio I visited the cathedral as part of the Rio Express Tour. Although it\u2019s a Roman Catholic cathedral, its design was based on Mayan architectural style of pyramids. In fact, the reflection of the cathedral on the opposite building looked very much like a",
          "Just fine for city tour. Not crowded, and Glass arts are massive and wonderful. Worth to visit this place.",
          "Monumental building!!! There are no windows at all - the four huge stained glass walls or windows are there but otherwise there are no opening windows. The four stained glass windows meet at a cross in the ceiling, They symbolize the four characteristic notes of the Church: One,",
          "This is an interestingly shaped Cathedral. It's easy to walk in & it has a kind of open air feel to it. Outside the front you can take cool photos of the reflection of the Cathedral in the glass of an adjacent building",
          "Even though it was hot on the day we visited, once we stepped into the (open-air) church we felt only cool breezes! It was amazing how comfortable the temperature was once inside. I was told that because of the way it is built/shaped the temperature is always pleasant. Stop",
          "The exterior has the shape of a pyramid and is not real pretty as it is concrete with the usual coating of mildew. The interior is beautiful and very large and naturally cool. Air flows in a cooling tower method and really adds it the uniqueness of the cathedral.",
          "The modern pyramidal shape makes look like a regular modern building. Inside is nice, but does not give you any spiritual feeling, too modern and commercial makes loose it's appeal.",
          "The reason why you should visit this church is due to its different shape. The shape itself makes it one of a kind although in my opinion no one could picture it to be a church from the pyramid shape. The exterior does not give away what is In stored inside where the works makes",
          "I visited the Cathedral as part of a tour group on a Thursday afternoon. The crowds were light & the weather was clear\u2026allowing the sunshine to light up the stunning stain glass windows. For those with a religious / spiritual side, suggest allowing up to an hour to enjoy the",
          "I was skeptical, given that this church looked like a volcano or some sort of mayan pyramid from the outside, but the inside is really quite nice. Tip- try to go during the middle of the day since the church relies on natural illumination and going earlier / later can leave it",
          "This can be the most intriguing looking cathedral you'll see: looking like an aztec pyramid , from outside you will never guess what it is . Nice vitrailles, free to visit, it is worth a short stop when around this area",
          "I have spend close to 80 days in Rio over the last 10 years. This March I had a job to do there and was \"forced\" to see the Metropolitan Museum. I am ashamed I did not make it one of my top 5 things to see in Rio before. It was build between 1964-1979 and designed by Edgar",
          "This was a great place to see and experience. Looks can be deceiving from the outside, but looks amazing on the inside. Well worth checking out!",
          "This is a very different kind of church/catedral and absolutly worth a look when in Rio. From the outside it just looks really strange and something out of a Eastern European communist building, but on the inside it is just so beautiful. And so big!",
          "from the outside it's quite ugly. You don't really know what it is. Then when you get inside, you finally know it's a cathedral where the Pope came in 2014. It's so big, the stained glass windows are huge and beautiful.",
          "The stark concrete exterior, set in what appears to be a car park hides the beauty that is within. The brilliant colours of the stained glass on a sunny day bring vibrancy and life to this tribute to God.",
          "Really beautiful with the sun shining though the stained glass windows. Our visit was spoiled someone as we were followed approximately 5 blocks from Escalera Celeron. Luckily our \"friend\" fled after he saw a police car arriving.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful and spiritual modern churches I've ever seen. It is very reminiscent of a pyramid in Chichen Itza from outside and inspires an awe of St. Peter's cathedral on inside. Put it on your list.",
          "The cathedral is a very unusual structure, especially for a cathedral. The concrete exterior is quite ugly at first sight, like so many concrete buildings of the age. The inside stain glass windows are pretty amazing, and so high! Not worth travelling too far but go if youre in",
          "If I had to select one thing as my favorite experience in Rio, a city often called the most beautiful city in the world, it would be this dark brutalist cathedral. This is an architectural wonder of such beauty - it makes you ache. From the outside, harsh cement and a direct",
          "A totally different building related to Christ. But it's also astonishing. Sit in, up your head and enjoy it. Probably you will never visit a place like this everywhere...",
          "Very interesting design with beautiful stained glass. Dark interior. Nice reflections of the unique structure in the glass buildings nearby. Not my favorite cathedral or basilica, but it is certainly worth a visit, a brief sit for contemplation, and some photos. If this",
          "Recently visited this unbelievable architectural wonder. Air conditioning not required due to design! Stained glass designs really cool!",
          "This is just a remarkable church that you must see. The structure is very unique, it's free to enter, and the inside is very beautiful.",
          "From the outside it is a building like no other. Modern , spacious and incredibly a refuge from the outside heat, it provides a feast for the senses to look up and admire the vastness and beauty of the stained glass around. The Nativity set was still there which I missed when I",
          "Had I not been told this was a church, I would never have guessed. It looks like a pyramid. The floor to ceiling stained glass windows are just beautiful. I didn't attend a service there but would probably find it difficult to feel that I had met an obligation there since the",
          "We visited the Cathedral in early January when the temperature was reaching over 36 degrees.. Incredibly although the streets were steaming hot inside the cathedral the air was fresh and cool, this was thanks to a marvelous architecture design that allows fresh air to circulate",
          "Really impressive on the inside and nice and cool as well and not too crowded. Probably not worth a special trip but if you are in the area, its worth the effort",
          "The Catedral Metropolitana has beautiful stained windows and offers some rest from busy and crowded downtown. It is located in walking distance from Carioca metro station. You can safely take metro or bus from Copacaban and explore Rio's downtown on feet starting from this",
          "From Christ of Redeemer Monument we saw an extraordinary structure shaped like an ice cream cone. The next day we took the metro to see this extraordinary structure. This is a Roman Catholic Cathedral built between 1964 and 1979. The rectilinear colourful stained glass windows,",
          "We visited the cathedral on a hot day and enjoyed the cool interior (in the original sense). From the outside it is an intriguing and rather unattractive grey teepee with a separate contemporary belltower. However, when you walk inside, you have to admire the size and design",
          "A modern cathedral that from the outside looked anything like my perception of a catherdral, but inside the 4 huge stained glass windows and furnishings make you believe it is. It is huge inside. It has an interesting bell tower outside which someone has enjoyed designing. I",
          "i just find it too modern for a catedral. would expect something few hundred years older. it was a little dissapointment forme.",
          "Sorry to dissent, but the modern design Metropolitan Cathedral (de San Sebastio) was sort of boring looking to me on the outside. Since there are not a lot of displays though, it only takes a couple minutes to look and judge for yourself. went for a mass and that was nice.",
          "This is SO ugly from the outside and is much better inside. There are huge stained glass windows and it almost feels like a theatre in the round. Worth a short visit just to see what the fuss is about.",
          "worth visiting this cathedral, it is a modern building, simple and cozy architecture that makes you feel like praying.",
          "So it looks a little ugly from the outside , however it is certainly impressive. Inside it is even spiritual. An amazing space created by some very uniqie archietecture. Surprisingly for me an enjoyable visit!",
          "The exterior of this cone shaped structure is heavy with concrete, but the interior is awe-inspiring with the large space surrounded by 4 large stained glass murals. The adjacent bell tower completes this architectural tour de force.",
          "This church is kind of bizarre. It is very modern. It does not feel like a church. It was not beautiful. I guess it is interesting, since it is different, but I would not recommend this as a good place to check out.",
          "From the outside the building looks like a museum or some sort of weird office building. It doesn't look like a church at all but it doesn't mean it's not a cool looking building. Once inside it's a very nice looking cathedral. It's not overdone like a lot of others with gaudy",
          "This is not your grandmother's cathedral. Starkly modern, and lit during the day through hundreds of colorful deeply colored stained glass windows, it's a calm and somewhat mystical space, as well as a cooling one. Don't know if it would have these qualities at night however.",
          "This Cathedral is unlike any other. It is huge and peaceful and mystical, the light filtered through myriad stained glass windows. It is also a great place to rest one's feet!",
          "Sao Sebastiao is an interesting piece of architecture because it isn't your common style of church. Apparently the legend has it that when it was built Pope John Paul I refused to recognize it as a Catholic church because of it's shape, but after the changing of the guard and",

          "What an amazing Cathedral to visit with it's modern architecture. Looks like a pyramid from the distance.The Cathedral has beautiful stain glass features spanning up along each wall corner and joining to the crucifix feature on the flat apex. It still had a beautiful Nativity",
          "On the outside I didn't really liked it, but when I got inside I loved it. I'm not a religious person but I think this place is very beautiful, specially it's stained glass that goes up until it gets to heaven. I think it is a great way of transmitting the sense of religion, and",
          "This modern cathedral is a stone pyramid looking thing from the outside but has gorgeous stained glass inside.",
          "A huge beautiful building that was included on the tour we went too. Sure was amazing, and relaxing sitting down and trying to sink the experience in. Would definitely recommend and go here again. Felt safe. Public toilets available too.",
          "This is a wonderful cathedral, which has a unique design to most other churches. The glass bricks/windows along the height of the cathedral let in a lot of light which makes photo taking much better. There was only a few masses at this cathedral sadly, sunday mass is only at",

          "According to couple of locals, Catedral area is quite rough and ready Friday to Monday, and should be avoided (especially coming from Lapa end). But if you are around during weekdays, and walking from Carioca or Cinelandia, then its well worth a visit. The interior is certainly",
          "I haven't seen a building like this before. Especially not a cathedral. Sharp contrast in comparison to the unpleasant and depressing outside makes stained glasses more vivid and colorful in some way. Definitely worth a visit and it's free.",
          "This is very untraditional cathedral - from the outside it looks like a cooling tower, but inside is interesting simple space with colorful stained glass. I recommend it to visit it during your wlak through the city center.",
          "I didn't like it at all! I really appreciate modern art and architecture and I have seen other modern views on other cathedrals, but this one is just a dark, ugly, concrete building. It didn't inspire me religion or warm feelings... I also didn't feel that it fits into the",

          "From the outside, this looks more like some sort of concrete office/city something....but inside, WOW. The long stained glass windows bending to the top of the cone/pyramid shaped church are jaw dropping. And, the interior space is huge. I differ from other reviewers; I would",
          "We visited as it was included as part of a tour. When you've explored so much of South America you think \"not another overly ornate Catholic Church / cathedral!!\" How wrong I was! It's... Well... Ugly as hell!! The outside is really funny looking. It takes some time to",
          "I have been in many cathedrals throughout the world but this one is different. First, it is open air. Second, it is multistory but the upper floors are not used. But, the stained glass windows are spectacular! This is not a \"must do\" but worth a visit if convenient. It is",
          "From the outside this looks like a council salt dump. Wait till you get inside. Wow! check out those stained glass windows that change colour as the sun moves round",
          "The fascinating shape of the outside is only enhanced by the inspiring beauty of the inside. The stained glass windows and the bronze crucifix are so impressive. You do not have to be religious to be wowed by this sight.",
          "This Cathedral was built in the 1960's in a modern style. If you ask me, modern = ugly. This Cathedral is conical shaped. There is no charge to enter, but donations are accepted. The alter is in the center of the Cathedral. Inside you can see panels of alternating stained glass",
          "I've seen dozens of magnificent cathedrals all around the world, but never one like this. Its modern architecture is eye-catching, the four stained glass windows spectacular, and the quiet dark indoor space a welcome contrast to the chaos outside in central Rio. Pope Francis",
          "Quite organized structure; the Cathedral's architecture from inside to outside allows to enjoy the warm of faith while standing inside. Not so full of images or ancient traditional details, you'll definitely get amazed of its simple but welcoming architecture.",
          "Wont take you long, so go, its a huge place that can house a crowd of 20K people, the architecture is unusual for a cathedral, being that is modern looking coned shaped rather than medieval,",
          "The cathedral is a concrete structure very dark inside (if you want to take pics you need a good camera), not really recommended, and you must be cautious with the surrounding gardens since it is not a safe place.",
          "Worth going to have a look close up at this Cathedral if you have the time, though not 'a must see' it is different at least.",
          "This is modern, and the building itself stands out. Inside there are beautiful coloured glass climbing up to the top that is worth checking out.",
          "Went here on a roundtrip in Rio after having visited Rio about 10 times. A very different church and not what I expected. The windows gave it a very special lighting-effect. A must-see when in Rio. Best for couples and adults.",
          "It has to be said that this is one ugly cathedral from the outside, and I really wasn't expecting much: 'a modernist architectural abomination, perhaps?' In fact, it was at the end of a day of sight-seeing, and I didn't even want to go in. But step inside and prepare to eat",
          "My first impression on seeing the exterior was \u2013 is this really a Cathedral? Looking at the conical shape with a fa\u00e7ade of concrete, its modernist architecture reads more like a hotel or a Mayan Temple. Don\u2019t be deceived as we were by the outside as it\u2019s more than it seems once",
          "Looks a little uninspiring from the outside, but it much more inside. Go take a look, be prepared to wait in line to leave the parking lot if you go with a tour or a private taxi. The folks who drive the big buses have no idea what they are supposed to be doing and the police",
          "we did a whole day of walking around centro admiring the lovely churches there. this is a modern structure though ... obviously does not have the same impact as the gold dripping igrejas. the stained glass windows on all sides meeting up at the cross in the center was a nice",
          "If you are expecting an old style church, then look at the other ones listed here. This is a modern building with a modern interior. Despite the heat outside, the interior was cool. The stained glass windows and hanging cross are the few distractions inside while you contemplate",
          "From the outside it is drab and boring, not in fitting with the modern buildings around it. Inside, it had no attraction other than the stained glass. Again, the huge amount of grey concrete made it dark and uninspiring. Furthermore, there were severe leaks in various places",
          "Although the outside did not seem too impressive at first, once I walked I a realized this was one of the most impressive structures I have been in. The sheer size was unexpected and humbling. The massive stained glass windows were beautiful. The church lights up a night,",
          "I was wondering why they would take us to a church in Rio. Especially one that looks like a concrete pyramid. But enter this catherdral and the stained glass windows fill it with light. it is amazing. Spend some time here to admire the stained glass windows and the amazing",
          "What a surprise while on our tour of Rio! While visiting other attractions in Rio, our guide made a quick stop here to let us walk through. We ended up spending a little more time than we expected when we got inside and saw the beautiful architecture and stained glass windows!",
          "Yes the building is good, stained glass walls are quite nice. But not much else to enjoy. Try to go on a weekend. If it is included in a day tour, then no harm, otherwise don't see a point to go out specifically to see this.",
          "Awesome place in a great area. Beautiful building inside although does not look it from the outside. Petrolbas Br HQ over the road. Must see the cathedral if you have time",
          "Due to it's architectural originality and size, this is a must see while in Rio... but try to visit on a sunny day to get the full effect of the windows.",
          "At first glance this building looks like a Mayan religious site but inside is a massive cathedral with beautiful stained glass windows. Brazil has a lot of beaches and churches/chapels/cathedrals and this has to be the largest and most modern. July 2009",
          "This conical shape cathedral is quite different to anything you have seen before. It reminded us of our Mexican tour because of its pyramid design. Its four floor to pinnacle stained glass windows each depict a story which the tour guide brought to life through his",
          "Included in a one day tour of Rio de Janeiro was a visit to this beautiful cathedral. When we arrived the outside of the building did not inspire us to go inside but were we glad that we did. The inside of the cathedral is beautiful to say the least. The four stained glass",
          "a biggest church modern architecture with a clear and full of light space, stained glasses, and representanting the most numerous catholic people in the world, Brasil.",
          "Like all the reviews say this Cathedral looks more like a modern art museum from the exterior with its almost ugly grey conical shape, however its absolutely worth taking some time to appreciate this rather unusually modern Catherdral. Inside it is spacious with its 400m high",
          "I saw this on a tour of the city and was not impressed on first sight as it looks like a grey concrete pyramid. However, it is really amazing inside. The stained class windows are sublime and there are a few other interesting things to see inside. Probably not one for kids -",
          "from outside it doesn't look like a very attractive place to see. but once you enter it's really breathtaking. suddenly you are in a huge space with glass windows. suddenly you don 't hear the noise of metropolis. just silence. enjoy it.",
          "My eyes were immediately drawn to this building when I was coming down from the lapa stairs. It looks like something the ancient Mayans would have made. It was beautiful inside too with its immense stained glass windows. The lapa arches are nearby as well, which are also well",
          "While the architecture is simple, the sheer size and the effect of the light (coming through the top and the side coloured mirrors) create quite a sight. Definitely worth a photo or two.",
          "A modern structure outside the centre, almost plain exterior, vast stained glass panels reaching the distant roof overlooking a simple interior - as mesmerising as a European Gothic cathedral in a different way",
          "it is better inside than the view you can have from the street, but , again it is not a normal church, it has beautiful vitrals, but is not like the perfect place to be relaxed.... it is part of most of the tour packages you can buy in Rio",
          "I think the building is ugly from the outside, just a concrete cone. Inside it is pretty cool with the four columns and a overhead of stained glass to light the place is beautiful colorful light. The crucifix appears to float above the altar. It is a site worth seeing.",
          "If you are on a city tour you can take a few pictures of this church. It has big vitrals that look some kind impressive and huge. Did not have a feeling of a relaxing place to pray...",
          "We were lucky to visit the Cathedral 5 min before closing, at night. One of the strongest impression in my life. Worth visiting",
          "Having done more than my fair share of cathedrals in South America, this one is really refreshing and well worth a visit. Its a lovely, modern and refreshing. Beautiful stained glass. Its no so easy to get to (no metro stop nearby), but its sell worth the taxi journey!",
          "from outside it does not look a church, ... it's a pyramid...but inside the stained glass from all four sides going all the way to the huge ceiling and merging into a cross is beautiful to look at.. definitely worth a vist after you see all the older and more traditional",
          "A strange looking building from the outside in a somewhat business district...I came across this place by accident and glad I did. From the outside it looks like it has multiple floors...venture inside and you'll be amazed at what you see....",
          "Mayan Shaped building in the historic area. The area looks iffy, but is regenerating - near the Lapa Arcos",
          "Very unique and worth a visit. Amazing stained glass. It is not in a very touristy area.",
          "Ok it may not look so amazing or resemble a traditional cathedral from the outside... nevertheless still worth a visit as very impressive inside. The stain glass windows and the hanging Christ cannot fail to impress. On a hot day this is a great place to cool off...",
          "Concrete built conical cathedral with seperate bell tower. Looks a bit \"Close Encounters\" from the outside, but inside the clever design means that it's naturally lit. A white glass cross forms the roof top, with four different coloured stained glass windows leading off from it.",
          "It is really worth a visit to go to the Catedral Metropolitana. The church dont look like other churches but is build like a pyramid. It is next to the business center of Rio.",
          "It defies the traditional. As we near it, we look out for what the usual cathedral structure should be, while in front of us stands a tall grey conical building much like a bishop's cap. The interiors are simple, devoid of any embellishments, except for the four stained glass",
          "As an attraction , I think that this is a beautiful site ! The architecture is unique original like a round Incan temple and the cooling system by itself is a marvel . It is a nice place to cool down when visiting Rio . The decoration is nice , pure and simple . The problem is",
          "As we pulled up to this building, I was surprised that it is a church. It looks more like a round pyramid with a chopped off top. But as we walked into this place, the feeling of peace is amazing. Apart from the 4 stained glass panels, the remaining sloped ceiling is all",
          "Go here & be surrounded by a sense of peace. It is beautiful inside - the stained glass is truly inspiring.",
          "After a busy day of walking around Centro, stepping inside this dramatic, modern cathedral and sitting in awe of the architecture and stained glass was a very lovely experience.",
          "The good thing: the vitros inside. The bad thing: the way to get there. Awful neighboorhood. http://www.catedral.com.br/",
          "this catedral locaded in downtown is very cute and so different to another catedrals of the world, because the structure is light a tall building and inside is just flat, you can see almos empty.",

          "Beautiful windows but looks like a modern pyramid, In the business district",
          "I hate this kind of buildings typical in Brazilian architecture influenced by the Ninja Turtle, Oscar Niemeyer. It ugly, not at all embracing, nor comfortable or functional. Reminds a dischargeable plastic cup upside down. Don\u2019t waste your time visiting it. Go to Saint",
          "The strange modern view of this cathedral is the only attraction of itself. Don't waste your time, unless you have to do something else later and don't know what to do downtown Rio.",
          "Reminds the Le Havre's cathedral... A lot of concrete.",
          "From the outside, you either love or hate this Edgar de Oliveira designed homage to Mayan temples. The inside presents a contradiction - on the one hand, there are the magnificent stained-glass windows that create a serene ambience within the church, helped by it's cavernous",
          "very interesting architecture. i guess from the 60s? beautiful inside.i joined the crowd on a sunday morning and it really was a nice experience. very devoted catholics overthere ! have a look.you will love it. (dont go at night.the area is not safe !!!",
          "Ugly on the outside, ugly on the inside. Forget about it.",
          "Looks like a building from the outside...but beautiful inside. Huge stained glass windows.",
          "From outside it looks like a bit too modern pyramide, but you have to go inside. It is a very different experience from within with the light falling in through 90m high windows, the modern sculptures, and the vast space lifting your spirits.",
          "The interior is impressive, with high walls, beautiful stained glass windows, and a huge interior space. Interesting that this \"green\" building uses natural heating and cooling.",
          "Interesting architecture, wonderful place to worship.",
          "Must admit, I'm not religious at all. We went in on a Sunday afternoon. There was no service on but the church itself brought tears to my eyes. The pure scale of the stained glass windows - nothing can quite describe it. Would definately recommend this",
          "It is a modern and nice cathedral. The stain glass huge windows were amazing!!",
          "Worth a visit to see the stained glass work in this large and ornate church",
          "A nice cool and relaxing location. The modern exterior does not prepare you for the spectacular stained glass and sculptures within. the interior is reminiscent of the Pantheon in Rome, though done in the style of Coventry Cathedral.",
          "A unique, dark, moody Catholic cathedral in that it towers maybe 150 feet above floor with only 4 windows, stained glass, extending to near pyramid's top. I defy you to find the confessionals.",
          "Rio has a lot more to offer than just beach. This Cathedral is in the downtown area, walking distance from the Museum of Modern Art. AMazing structure and stained glass.",
          "What a surprise. A huge concrete pyramid from the outside, but beautiful inside. An enormous building with gorgeous stained glass windows and statues.",
          "Ok so it looks like an Alien ship from the outside, its still a work of art. The stain glass windows are beautiful",
          "I was not impressed, its just a lump of concrete in the middle of a rather depresive area ? Go only if you have absolutely nothing else to do",
          "It's very interesting, a modern cathedral in the center of Rio. It's pity that they don't take care of it :(",
          "Despite of the fact that Brazil is only 510 years old, thre are other cathedrals and churches which have more to offer to the visitors. This is, however, a modern construction, which will please those who like modern architecture.",
          "I don't like it.too modern,too clean,too ugly.sorry! I can't help.there are too many places before coming here even if you are going to stay here a whole year.perhaps during a storm,you are downtown,without an umbrella...ok",
          "In a city that struggles to do much for the traveller the Cathedral stands out. A brilliant bit of work.",
          "This was stunning. The cathedral was shaped like a pyramid with beautiful stained glass windows on the walls. Loved it.",
          "Unimpressive modern concrete slabs from the outside but internally so different and well worth a visit.",

          "Found this Cathedral by mistake looking for the other one! Walked around Rio and did eventually find the \"old\" Cathedral but this one was equally if not more impressive. It reminded me of the new Cathedral in Liverpool which is similar in many ways. the stained glass windows are",

          "I never heard of this cathedral and we stopped there on a tour and I was really amazed! Structurally, it might not have been as difficult to construct as the Sydney Opera House, but is is unique and impressive. I would think that architecture fans would enjoy it as well as a",

          "Stunning glass, just stand inside for 10 minutes and breathe",
          "This is a very interesting structure, it somewhat would remind you of a pyramid - location is a bit strange, but it\u00b4s worth a visit.",
          "This is by far a very unique church with long towering stained glass and a design like no other in it's pyramid/cone shape. It is worth the short visit to see this marvel.",
          "If you are to pick one architectural sight in Rio, I would go for this place. Modern, different and very special this cathedral is well worth some time looking into. Try to get someone to explain the building to you to understand the genius in its design. 20-30 min will be",
          "Sorry to dissent, but the modern design Metropolitan Cathedral (de San Sebastio) was sort of boring looking to me on the outside, and a non-event on the inside. Since there are not a lot of displays though, it only takes a couple minutes to look and judge for yourself. View a",

        "wiki": "Copacabana (Portuguese pronunciation: [k\u0254pak\u0250\u02c8b\u0250\u0303n\u0250, ko-, -p\u0250-, -ka\u02c8-]) is a bairro (neighbourhood) located in the South Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is known for its 4 km (2.5 miles) balneario beach, which is one of the most famous in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe district was originally called Sacopenap\u00e3 (translated from the Tupi language, it means \"the way of the soc\u00f3s\", the soc\u00f3s being a kind of bird) until the mid-18th century. It was renamed after the construction of a chapel holding a replica of the Virgen de Copacabana, the patron saint of Bolivia. The name may be derived from the Aymara kota kahuana, meaning \"view of the lake.\" The social scientist Mario Monta\u00f1o Arag\u00f3n found in the \"archives of Indias\" in Sevilla, Spain, a different history: \"Kotakawana\" is the god of fertility in ancient Andean mythology, the equivalent to the classical Greek goddess Aphrodite or the Roman Venus. This god is androgynous and lives in the Titicaca, and his court consists of creatures (male and female) that are represented in colonial sculptures and in Catholic churches. They were called \"Umantuus\", known as mermaids in Western culture.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nCopacabana begins at Princesa Isabel Avenue and ends at Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Beyond Copacabana, there are two small beaches: one, inside Fort Copacabana and the other, right after it: Diabo (\"Devil\") Beach. Arpoador beach, where surfers go after its perfect waves, comes next, followed by the famous borough of Ipanema. The area was one of the four \"Olympic Zones\" during the 2016 Summer Olympics. According to Riotur, the Tourism Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro, there are 63 hotels and 10 hostels in Copacabana.\n\n\n== Copacabana Beach ==\nCopacabana beach, located at the Atlantic shore, stretches from Posto Dois (lifeguard watchtower Two) to Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Leme is at Posto Um (lifeguard watchtower One). There are historic forts at both ends of Copacabana beach; Fort Copacabana, built in 1914, is at the south end by Posto Seis and Fort Duque de Caxias, built in 1779, at the north end. One curiosity is that the lifeguard watchtower of Posto Seis never existed. Hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs and residential buildings dot the promenade facing Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica.  On Sundays and holidays, one side of Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica is closed to cars, giving residents and tourists more space for activities along the beach.  \nCopacabana Beach plays host to millions of revellers during the annual New Year's Eve celebrations, and in most years, has been the official venue of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. \n\n\n== Copacabana promenade ==\nThe Copacabana promenade is a pavement landscape in large scale (4 kilometres long). It was rebuilt in 1970 and has used a black and white Portuguese pavement design since its origin in the 1930s: a geometric wave. The Copacabana promenade was designed by Roberto Burle Marx.\n\n\n== Living standard ==\nCopacabana has the 11th highest Human Development Index in Rio; the 2000 census put the HDI of Copacabana at 0.902.\n\n\n== Neighbourhood ==\nAccording to the IBGE, 160,000 people live in Copacabana and 44,000 or 27.5% of them are 60 years old or older. Copacabana covers an area of 7.84 km2 which gives the borough a population density of 20,400 people per km2. Residential buildings eleven to thirteen stories high built next to each other dominate the borough. Houses and two-story buildings are rare.\nWhen Rio was the capital of Brazil, Copacabana was considered one of the best neighborhoods in the country.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nMore than 40 different bus routes serve Copacabana, as do three subway Metro stations: Cantagalo, Siqueira Campos and Cardeal Arcoverde.\nThree major arteries parallel to each other cut across the entire borough: Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica (Atlantic Avenue), which is a 6-lane, 4 km avenue by the beachside, Nossa Senhora de Copacabana Avenue and Barata Ribeiro/Raul Pomp\u00e9ia Street both of which are 4 lanes and 3.5 km in length. Barata Ribeiro Street changes its name to Raul Pomp\u00e9ia Street after the S\u00e1 Freire Alvim Tunnel. Twenty-four streets intersect all three major arteries, and seven other streets intersect some of the three.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\nOn 26 April 1949, RMS Magdalena broke in two as she was being towed into Rio de Janeiro harbour. Much of her cargo of oranges was washed up upon the beach.\nOn December 31, 1994, the New Year's Eve celebrations featured a Rod Stewart concert with an attendance of 3.5 million, making it the largest concert crowd ever. More recently, the beach has been a site for huge free concerts unrelated to the year-end festivities. On March 21, 2005, Lenny Kravitz performed there in front of 300,000 people, on a Monday night. On February 18, 2006, a Saturday, The Rolling Stones surpassed that mark by far, attracting over 1.5 million people to the beach.\nOn July 7, 2007, the beach hosted the Brazilian leg of the Live Earth concerts, which attracted 400,000 people. As the headliner, Lenny Kravitz got to play the venue a second time, with Jorge Benjor, Macy Gray, O Rappa and Pharrell as the main opening acts.\nOn October 2, 2009, 100,000 people filled the beach for a huge beach party as the IOC announced Rio would be hosting the 2016 Olympics. 11 of the 15 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups have taken place here.\nOn July 28, 2013, the beach hosted the final event of the World Youth Day 2013. About 3 million people including 3 presidents joined Pope Francis when he celebrated the holy mass.\nFrom May till July, 2014 the United Buddy Bears exhibit was held on the Copacabana promenade and attracted more than 1,000,000 people. The presentation consisted of more than 140 bear sculptures, each two metres high and designed by a different artist.\nIn August 2016, Copacabana Beach was the site of beach volleyball in the Olympic Games.\n\n\n== New Year's Eve in Copacabana ==\nThe fireworks display in Rio de Janeiro to celebrate New Year's Eve is one of the largest in the world, lasting 15 to 20 minutes. It is estimated that 2,000,000 people go to Copacabana Beach to see the spectacle. The festival also includes a concert that extends throughout the night. The celebration has become one of the biggest tourist attractions of Rio de Janeiro, attracting visitors from all over Brazil as well as from different parts of the world, and the city hotels generally stay fully booked.\n\n\n=== History ===\nNew Year's Eve has been celebrated on Copacabana beach since the 1950s when cults of African origin such as Candombl\u00e9 and Umbanda gathered in small groups dressed in white for ritual celebrations. The first fireworks display occurred in 1976, sponsored by a hotel on the waterfront and this has been repeated ever since. In the 1990s the city saw it as a great opportunity to promote the city and organized and expanded the event.\nAn assessment made during the New Year's Eve 1992 highlighted the risks associated with increasing crowd numbers on Copacabana beach after the fireworks display. Since the 1993-94 event concerts have been held on the beach to retain the public. The result was a success with egress spaced out over a period of 2 hours without the previous turmoil, although critics claimed that it denied the spirit of the New Year's tradition of a religious festival with fireworks by the sea. The following year Rod Stewart beat attendance records. Finally, the Tribute to Tom Jobim - with Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, and Paulinho da Viola - consolidated the shows at the Copacabana R\u00e9veillon.\nThere was a need to transform the fireworks display in a show of the same quality. The fireworks display was created by entrepreneurs Ricardo Amaral and Marius. From the previous 8\u201310 minutes the time was extended to 20 minutes and the quality and diversity of the fireworks was improved. A technical problem in fireworks 2000 required the use of ferries from New Year's Eve 2001-02. New Year's Eve has begun to compete with the Carnival, and since 1992 it has been a tourist attraction in its own right.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistory of Copacabana (in English)\nCopacabana - Tropical Crime Noir",

During the 1920s Lage had the mansion remodeled by Italian architect Mario Vodret, with interior paintings by Salvador Payols Sabat\u00e9. \nIn the 1960s the land became a public park, with walking trails through subtropical forest. The Escola de Artes Visuais do Parque Lage (Visual Arts School of Parque Lage) and a caf\u00e9 open to the public operate from the former mansion.\nThe mansion was notably featured in the 2003 music video for Snoop Dogg's single \"Beautiful\".\n\n\n== External links ==\nEscola de Artes Visuais do Parque Lage\nPlage Cafe\nInstituto Terra Brasil\nParque Lage to Christ the Redeemer",

          "We came to Parque Lage for lunch (We had heard it has a good and trendy restaurant/cafe), a few drinks, to relax, and enjoy the free-entry, public park. The villa is very nice, with beautiful architecture. Lots of people were taking selfies in the villa. The entire park is",
          "You may easily reach this Park after walking around Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas (recommended, as this is a nice lake in the middle of Rio). Also very close you may also visit Jardim Botanico (Botanic Garden) within a walking distance from Parque Lage. Parque Lage is not so big, but",
          "Ditto on the pregnant women. Apparently it's a big thing in Brazil but the professional shoots really take over areas for 15-20 minutes at a time. In addition the coffee shop and gallery were closed for a private function so although the gardens are nice, it was not",
          "We visited Parque Lage in late June 2018. We have visited Rio de Janeiro many times but had never visited the park before. We walked from Forte de Copacabana to the park took over an hour to get there, but it was a really nice walk along a marked path. The parque is a hidden",

          "We went out of way to visit Parque Lage but it was a bit underwhelming to be honest, it is very beautiful and picturesque but quite small, it was nice to walk around the grounds and we saw lots of marmoset monkeys close up. As we had come quite a way in a taxi we stayed for some",
          "We came to the park to hike from there to the Cristo Redentor, but the park ended up being the high point of the hike. The hike itself was also very good and with a lot og monkeys, but Cristo Redentor is quite crowded. The park looks very old and lush, with a lot og gems like",

          "We enjoyed the beautiful setting of the villa and the huge Park which is alike the Rio jungle. You can spot monkeys tolling around and explore many plants and hidden paths. The coffee inside the villa in the patio with pool is a must to close off your visit. Very friendly staff",
          "Walking from ipanema beach, around the lagoon, and finish in park lage, it is beautiful, you can have a lunch in the park, but by the time we arrived there it was crowded so we preferred to go else where. Prices are expensive. But even if you don\u2019t buy anithing the sights are",
          "A sunny warm day made Parque Lage great for a wander with stunning views and if your hungry or thirsty a good place to sit down for a coffee . If you have a lot of time in Rio then it\u2019s defo a place to add to your list of must visit .",
          "I have returned to Parque Lage afte many years. And it is in pristine condition. What a beautiful manor house incrusted in the middle of an atlantic forest with the mountain of the Christ in the backdrop. It is a cultural center that also holds an Arts School. When I got there",

          "Just like the Selaron Stairs, I was interesting in seeing the location of some of the older popular music videos that I saw when I was younger. I didn\u2019t realize how beautiful the property was. I\u2019m not 100% sure of the history behind the property, but I thought that it was pretty",
          "We went before even considering to check in advance if this bar/restaurant is open at all. When we arrived in the park, unfortunately they wouldnt let us inside the building. No one of the doormen spoke English but it looked like there was some preparation for an evening event.",
          "We got there after visiting the Cristo. It's not too far, though we took a local bus to get there. It's a very beautiful park, with a once very luxurious mansion in the middle of it. Now there is a little cafe there (I was told serves the best brunches in Rio, though I didn't",
          "I arrived by mistake looking for the botanical gardens, but this was a bit of e gem and was free. Landcasped by Tyndale, this is a great marriage of the old and new worlds. You're supposed to be careful here, but the olny alarm I experienced was half-exposed Brazillian",
          "Yes, come and take the obligatory photograph of yourself with the weather-worn estate, emerald pool, steamy jungle and Cristo in the background, then wander the grounds, which could use a little cleaning up. But avoid the cafe. The waitstaff is very pleasant and it\u2019s great for",

          "A friend took us while we were in town to see the house and the view of Christ the Redeemer. There were monkey's around so my friend was really excited to see them in the trees looking for food. We didn't have a lot of time or we would have explored more, but there were people",
          "Went there and had a coffee in the caf\u00e9. Real nice. At entrance though, I was by a person and signs told not to take photos in the buildind outside as well as inside. Sitting there we observed plenty of photos being taken using smartphones. The person did not attempt to stop",
          "We went to Parque Lage twice in our 4 day visit to Rio. The grounds are really well kept and you need walk around for a good hour to see everything. We stopped at the Art School, also known as the place Snoop Dog and Pharrell shot Beautiful, and enjoyed food and drinks. service",
          "A nice park (More like a forest). Apart from the main tourist attraction, the hotel and the pool, the park beside is impressive. You can get some nice shots on your DSLR and looks right out the jungle. Not a must visit. But if you have some time to spend in the Rio, do visit",

          "Not much to see, but it is a very nice place. The parc itself has about 3/4 nice points of interest that can be quickly seen, But, the main interest is that you can climb to the corcovado from there. Be careful on or after a rainy day : it becomes very slippery and can be",
          "It's a nice (not so large) park in the city, close to the Botanical garden. It's perfect for a quiet walk and to spot some monkeys. It was apparently also a popular spot to take wedding pictures as we saw 3 couples with their photographer.",
          "There's a nice bar inside the building which once housed a prominent figure in the arts and his wife. It's not very large, so you will be able to visit most of the premises with 1-2hours. Don't fail to go inside the mini-aquarium and to go up the tower. It's worth the visit.",
          "A very lovely park with a beautiful residence and a good view of the Christ the Redeemer statue. Once inside the park you are instantly in the green lush even though you are still in the middle of the city. We came here to do the corcovado trail to the Christ the Redeemer. But",
          "Talk about a diamond in the rough! It was hard to fathom a tranquil, tropical park being in the bustling city of Rio, but it definitely exists. We had a few daylight hours to spend before our final night's dinner, so my spouse and I hopped in an Uber which was insanely",
          "Buildings a bit shabby but still a spectacular residence. Gardens cover a large area and offer many trails. Not an essential stop but worthy of consideration.",
          "First, this little spot is free, so you really have to see it anyways because it costs you nothing. It is a mix of old stone work from a sugarmill and rainforest wilderness all around you. Being in the forest, it was a bit cooler than the city areas and it was comfortable",
          "My boyfriend and I came here after reading in a guide that it was a must visit in Rio. It's free to enter so we thought we'd have nothing to lose! As we walked up the entrance, we monkies in the trees - is there a more positive way to start a day out for those coming to observe",
          "I would recommend it whilst you go around the lake. Worth a stop. We saw the lovely mini aquarium, walked inside the nice building were the school of visual arts is now located. Even saw 2 lovely monkeys!",

          "Rio is a big and hot city. This place is excellent to feel far away from the inevitable pollution and heat, for it has so many trees that only in a few spots we are not under them. A great place for picnics (don't feed the monkeys!) or a little walk, it gets a little busy on",
          "My first visit was with a group of photographing students. We decided to have one of our practicals here and no regrets at all. The park opens at 08.00hrs and you can park your car inside the park as long as the place is not full. There are parking spots around but you might",

          "Loved visiting this place. Only dissappointing thing was the weather which didn't play along the first day so we had to try again. Just pay too much to tour operators, instead rather take Rio Tourism shuttle which costs R $71 from Copocabana. It takes you there and back. Plus",
          "We were looking for a shady spot yesterday afternoon and this was just the right place to come to. The lovely cafe/restaurant invites you to stay, we just had a beer and some excelent p\u00e3o de queijo and were on our way to know the gardens which are full of surprises ranging from",
          "Rio is really an unbelievable place, everywhere you go there's so much green and natural beauties. Close to the Botanical Gardens, this place is a great place for a peaceful walk, picnic, or if you're into hiking and want to explore some of the region's fauna and flora. There is",
          "I visited this park as opposed to the Botanical Gardens which I assumed would be more generic, and I'd read a lot about the beauty of this park. It has so much going on, and makes for a beautiful walk or picnic spot, and also has a popular cafe in the centre too. It was filled",
          "A nice area down the road from the (more impressive) botanical gardens, but we came here particularly for the cafe which was highly rated. We couldn't agree more - a burger and a pulled pork sandwich later and we wished something similar existed back home!",
          "This old sugar mill farm in the \"foot\" of Corcovado mountain is just magnificent. This area is full of trails, caves, nature, animals, history, art, ponds, gardens, and small waterfalls. Great place to spend a day with your significant other, family and friends.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Quinta da Boa Vista (English: Estate with the Good View) is a public park of great historical importance located in the S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o neighbourhood, in the North zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The park was part of the gardens of the S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Palace, the residence of the Emperors of Brazil in the 19th century and the home of the Zoological Garden of Rio de Janeiro, with over 2000 species of animals.. The building of the old palace hosted the National Museum, with collections on natural history, ethnology and archaeology.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe area now occupied by the Quinta da Boa Vista used to be part of a Jesuit farm. After 1759, when the Jesuits were expelled from colonial Brazil, the land was divided and given to private landlords. In the early 19th century, part of the farm belonged to Elias Ant\u00f3nio Lopes, a rich Portuguese merchant, who around 1803 built a manor house on top of a hill. From this hill one could appreciate a wonderful view of the Guanabara Bay, hence the name Boa Vista (nice view) of the Quinta.\nWhen Prince Regent John VI and the Portuguese court arrived in Rio de Janeiro, in 1808, Elias Ant\u00f3nio Lopes donated his farm to the Prince. John VI appreciated very much the gift, and stayed long periods in the manor house. At the time, the farm was located relatively far from the city of Rio de Janeiro, and was surrounded by mangroves and swamps. Later these had to be eliminated to facilitate the access to the city.\n\n\n=== Imperial Palace ===\n\nTo better accommodate the Portuguese Royal Family, the house went through a renovation between 1816 and 1821, directed by English architect John Johnston. In front of the palace, Johnston installed a decorative gate, a gift sent from England to Brazil by Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. The gate was later transferred to the entrance of the zoological garden of the Quinta. The house became known as the Pa\u00e7o de S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o (English: Palace of Saint Christopher).\nAfter the declaration of the Republic of Brazil, the Imperial family left the country and the Palace and its surrounding gardens became empty.\n\n\n== The Quinta today ==\nThe Quinta da Boa Vista is a very popular attraction for locals and also tourists. The fact that the North zone of Rio de Janeiro, where the Quinta is located, has very few public parks only contributes to its popularity. The main attractions are the park itself, with its green areas, centenary trees and lakes, as well as the National Museum and the Zoological Garden.\n\n\n=== National Museum ===\n\nFounded in 1818 by King John VI of Portugal, the National Museum was transferred to the old Imperial Palace of the Quinta in 1892. During its long history, its collections have been greatly expanded by acquisitions and donations, including by Emperor Pedro II, a great sponsor of the sciences. The collections included Astronomy (mostly meteorites), Palaeontology, Natural history, Ethnology (including many interesting works by Brazilian indigenous peoples) and Archaeology (mostly antiquities from ancient Egypt). \nMuch of the art collection displayed by the Museum consisted of what was gathered by the Emperor Pedro II himself. In this manner, it reflects 19th-century views of Anthropology, Archaeology and sciences in general. Additionally, as is the case with the building, the collection was poorly preserved.\nUntil the September 2018 fire, visitors could also see a few rooms of the ancient Palace with its original painted and stucco decoration, like the Throne Room, the Embassadors' Room and the room of Empress Teresa Cristina. These rooms displayed a couple original pieces but were overall empty.\n\n\n=== Zoological Garden ===\n\nThe Zoo of Rio is perhaps the most popular attraction of the Quinta. It was inaugurated in 1945 under President Get\u00falio Vargas and is the oldest in Brazil. Among its over 2000 animals, the collections of Brazilian monkeys and birds are particularly important.\n\n\n== References ==\nCentro de Arquitetura e Urbanismo do Rio de Janeiro (2000).

          "The park is small. It is comfortable walking there in winter time (June), but in summer it must be very hot. The museum is small too; there are exhibits on broad topics. However, it is interesting to see an imperial place, it is just pity that not much of original interior and",

From the top of the hill there are views of the Municipal Park, the botanical garden and a long stretch of the south coast.\n\n\n== 2016 Summer Olympics ==\n\nThe men's and women's 2016 Olympic cycling  road course started at Fort Copacabana and included the Vista Chinesa Circuit.   This course sector features 2 of the 4 climbs in the 2016 route layout. The circuit ran clockwise from the Estr. da G\u00e1vea, first for the Canoas climb (Estr. das Canoas), then the Vista Chinesa climb (Estr. da Vista Chinesa) before descending back to Av. Niemeyer (the coastal stretch which connects the circuit to the main route).\nThe men's road race included three laps of the 25.7 km (15.9 mi) circuit for a total of 77.1 km of the 241.5 km race distance.

          "As you can read in the many reviews, you can indeed take an uber or taxi to the vista chinesa. We decided to hike. We took an uber until parque da cidade in gavea (estrada santa marinha). You enter the park and will see several signs to trilha. After a while you arrive more in",
          "Even if there are a lot of look outs to see Rio from the top, each one gives you a different view of the city, and this one is worth doing as it is only about 10 minutes by car by Corcovado. Worth the additional ride",
          "This is by far the best place to see the city and beaches below! The views are fantastic! We would highly recommend everyone to go to this vista",
          "It might take you some physical strength to go up the hill (or you take a taxi), but it is definitely worth it. Beautiful view over the city, not crowded, and it's for free. ;) Tip: Grab some food and drinks for your way up there, you might want to stay there for a while to",

          "It's totally wasted time to go there. It's so ugly & unspectacular that you better spend your time somewhere else. And yes the view is good but I could count 1000 better views than this spot. Avoid please!",
          "Not worth the effort of going there. This seems to be a filler on some tours. You get the same views from Sugarloaf or Christ the Redeemer - this is disappointing",
          "We only stopped off here for a few minutes, but the views from the lookout were brilliant, especially on a clear day, you can see Christ the Redeemer from the vista. Worth visiting if you're passing near the Botanical garden or exploring the Tijuca Forest.",
          "A place that you can visit in order to have a nice view on Rio. You will not spend more than 5-10 minutes which is enough time to take some photos.",
          "There was much more to see than we saw. We went on a Monday and they are closed on Mondays. Oh well.",
          "A nice ride out of town and a good view but not spectacular. You're done in 5 minutes, the ride up/down is nice though. and when continuing into the forest or the botanical gardens a good stop.",

          "If you come here do it to visit the overall Tijuca park, NOT just this view... THe park is amazing and this view is just one of the many areas you can visit. Make a day trip and visit the large park with all the great vistas and hiking trails... This view is very nice but I",

          "If you enjoy nature and want a good view of the city, this is the place to go. It's not crowded like other turistic places and it's in the middle of a small forest. And it's free. If you are in to sports and hiking, you can go on foot or bike.",
          "This was at the end of a Jeep tour we did, later on in our trip to Rio, and was easily worth our while. A brilliant view of Rio which included Christ the Redeemer as well as Sugarloaf, the lagoa, Ipanema. Great to capture/envision places we enjoyed during our stay in one",
          "Our wonderful tour guide found this spot up high where we could see P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar and the mountains, lush trees, the city and gorgeous ocean. No tourists when we went!",

          "To me, that live in Rio, this is the best view of the city. If you are not in a tour, you can take the 4km uphill walk (500m up) and I am sure it will be worth it, especially in a sunny day! I recommend going on weekends though. It is very common to find bikers and runners",
          "An unforgettable picture. Mandatory passage for those visiting the Rio de Janeiro is one of the most beautiful views in the world.",
          "Not exactly an easy place to find, the Vista Chinesa is a Chinese styled construction in the middle of the rain forest surrounding Rio de Janeiro. You can either drive up there for a formidable view of the city below, or you can face the challenge to ride a bicycle all the way",
          "This was the last stop on our tour of Rio and really wrapped up the beauty of this city. Christ the Redeemer actually was visible from their after spending all day playing peekaboo. It was great to see it, Sugar Loaf Mountain and the beaches from here.",
          "A bit \"off the beaten track\" this spot has great views from Rio. We came here with a Jeep Tour and it was very enjoyable.",
          "Stucked in the Tijuca \"jungle\" Park it has one of the most amazing views in the city. It is also close to the \"Emperor\u00b4s table\", a place in which the Emperor used to have a breakfast and lunch in the ancient times. The view out there is also amazing.",
          "We have Corcovado, P\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00facar but as per my opinion nothing beats the view from this spot, it is full of beauty",
          "One of the most beautiful views from Rio de Janeiro. I really recommend the visit! The whole Vista Chinesa way is nice, including the Mesa do Imperador",
          "This is well worth it when visiting rio but the best way is to get the services of a taxi as there are no large groups and view from the top is awesome,it's also best to not get there around early afternoon as we made that mistake and it was pretty crowded there are no shops",
          "There is a urban forest in Rio de Janeiro called \"Floresta da Tijuca\". It is a beautiful green area in the hills of Rio. From Vista Chinesa you can see a beautiful view of the sea, the laggon and different mountains. It is worth a visit.",
          "After crossing an area of Atlatic forest, you reach a calm (and non paid) place where you are able to see the Corcovado, Rodrigo de Freita's Lagoon and Ipanema beach. Rio is nicer from far.",
          "We went there with a guided tour in Tijuca National Park. The view was awesome. Our tour guide mentioned that a politician built this to honor the large number of Chinese immigrants and their value to the city's history. The best spor of the tour in the Park!",

          "The view is awesome from up here. Our tour guide mentioned that a politician built this to honor the large number of Chinese immigrants and their value to the city's history. It's amazing how many beautiful views this city has.",
          "Great view of the south side of Rio. Pretty calm and quiet compared to other vistas. My group got to the area in open air jeep tour ride. Gave a good sense of the Tijuca forest surrounding the view and guides gave a good explanation of the meaning behind the memorial area.",
          "Either by running, biking or sightseeing this is one of the best views of the Rio Zona Sul. Very good place to stop and admire Rio de Janeiro sights before stopping at the Emperor's Table.",
          "Vista Chinesa is another lovely point of interest to visit during your Rio trip. It is in the Parque Nacional da Tijuca and could be part of your itinerary for a day trip to the Parque. Great vistas with stunning photo opportunities on a lovely clear day. Highly recommended.",
          "We went by car, but we were impressed by all the alternative ways people go up this mountain - motorbikes, normal bikes, in-lines... The view is amazing and you also see the Cristo Redentor. It is a place to take pictures but the journey up is in itself a very impressive one.",
          "Bring your camera... you'll not regret it... it's an amazing scenic view of Rio de Janeiro's beachs.",
          "We visited this place and it was a long drive up the hill . Though an hour drive from copacabana but it was worth , the view was breath taking and could see Christ the redeemer from here . Also one can on way back take a ride in a boat in the back waters",
          "Especially on weekends, many bicyclists take on the 5km climb up to Vista Chinesa. The place has a sort of Chinese pagoda and is located on a view point from where you can overlook the south zone of Rio de janeiro, especially the Lagoon and Jockey club area.",
          "If you are energetic and reasonably fit, it is worth taking a hike up the hill that leads t oVista Chinesa form Horto, near Jardim Bot\u00e2nico. The road uphill is good, safe, there quite a few bikers cycling up, and the views you enjoy form the top of the hill are among the most",
          "There's a greate view from the Christ the redeemer, Sugar loaf mountain and Rodrigo de Freitas lake. The access to the Vista Chinesa is not easy. There's a small and steep road. If you don't have private ou rented car I strongly advise to take a cab and ask to wait you there",
          "Beautiful view of the bay and less crowded... much less than Corcovado... Take your camera for great shots. You must stop there if you are in the area.",
          "It's so easy to go up there, and it's free!! Another amazing view of the city and super cool. I Love just go there and hang out with friends.. don't miss it!",
          "Choose one very sunshine day with few clouds for a better view. Speechless view. Take care with hundreds of skaters and bikers when driving up and down the hills.",
          "started from Jardim Botanico and followed the google map directions up to Parque Nacional Tijuca... it was easy following the road and the lovely shade of the forest trees made the uphill walk easier and you can stop by the waterfall for a dip to freshen up. Would be nice if",
          "We arrived in the morning and this attraction really blew us away. What an incredible view. The drive up to this location was as rewarding as the view itself. Truly a rainforest we felt refreshed just breathing the air. The view was magnificent and contained so much of rio.",
          "a place where you can see Rio from upside. It looks like a painting when youou go in the dawn. Breath the air of the forest and be in contact with nature. I also recommend going up rinding a bike. Its really nice, but a a tuff ride.",
          "One of the best views of Rio... Breathtaking... How to go? Easiest and cheapest way is to walk from Botanic garden until the enrance of the Tijuca National Park and hitchiking :) Its just a 4km distance. You can even try to walk in the beautiful nature of Tijuca forest.",
          "From this point you can so all of the Zona Suda as well as the Christ. It is really breath taking. I personally walked up to this point (about 2 hours uphill), but it can also be done by bike or car. On the way up you follow a paved road, but it is almost always covered by",
          "Lots of tours take you here or you can cycle or walk to it. It is a bit of a slog so I would recommend a tour or taxi to get here. The view is spectacular and you can see both Christ and Sugar Loaf. There's not much to do around it but it is worth going to.",
          "Even tho' the place is amazing and the view is breathtaking, please be aware it is dangerous, and that's the reason why it is always peaceful and with few - or none - tourists. The road to get there is really beautiful, but as a local, I'd recommend you not to go. It's not",
          "I think this is the best view in rio. Better than Corcovado and better than sugar loaf. A must see. About half way up there is a waterfall on right side where you can stop and go for a swim. Then at the lookout, you have great views of Corcovado, Lagoa, ipanema, Copacabana,",
          "This is perhaps one of the nicest views of Rio. It's kind of a hassle to get there, but it is well worth the effort. The Chinese monument at the spot is quite interesting, too.",
          "If you have an opportunity, you definetly should go there! This a great visual and a huge landscape to admire. You can see Rio as you can see in movies and others international remarks.",
          "Great place to get a good view of Rio with much less crowds than you get at the Christ statue - if you are in town it's easy to get there by car and worth a visit",
          "I took a cab to go to this attraction, the view is ok - not so much as you see at Cristo and P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar, or even at the Forte de Copacabana. But at least is free. But the time that you take to get in, and the price that you will have to pay for the driver ... I don\u00b4t think",
          "If you want to enjoy the beautiful of Tijuca forest, don't miss this attraction. You will see a beautiful view of the main post card of Rio de Janeiro and enjoy nature. There is no fee for this attraction but the only terrible thing is that you have to take a taxi or go by car",
          "Lovely view from inside Tijuca forest was the impression we got from all our reserch but it is better to go with tour groups",
          "The easiest access to Vista Chinesa is made through Botanical Gardens Neighborhood, either by taking the 409/416 bus which passes through most of Zona Sul coming from Saes Pena through Lapa, or the 125 bus from Ipanema, but they both go only 1/3 of the way up, the rest you have",
          "This is arguably the best view of Rio de Janeiro. It may be a little tricky to reach this site, but if you feel a little adventurous, it is well worth it! The Asian kiosk was being remodeled when we visited and the site was not very busy.",
          "The place to go when visiting the city. Nice view, there are parking place. Just take care to not visit late afternoon when is getting dark due to security.",
          "This is our favourite viewpoint and we try to include it when we do private guided tours. The \"chinese\" pavillion is not nice, but it is an amazing view.I suggest to go there in the morning - you'll have the mist stretching out over the distant mountains - as well as the South",
          "The view is nothing short of spectacular, but caution is advised. The area known as the Tijuca Forest, in which this attraction is located, has been the site of several recent robberies. There are still un-pacified favelas nearby, and tourists unfortunately make for easy",
          "This is probably one of the best views you can get in Rio. Well worth the trip up there. We travelled in a jeep up there, but you can walk (if brave!), cycle (if braver!) or drive up. There seemed to be work going on at the place so there was a bit of scaffolding up there at the",
          "You will need to drive or, if you are in shape, take your bike, to reach Vista Chinesa. You will not find even street vendors there - it is just the view. But then it will probably be THE view to be remembered. Make sure to drive a little further to the Emperor Table. Both",
          "It is totally worth to go to vista chinesa. The way it is wonderful and the view it's amazing. You will see the Cristo Redentor, ipanema and Copacabana beach and much other things.",
          "It's a different point of view of Rio from this spot, but certainly not as dramatic as Corcovado or Sugarloaf. If you've gone to both, Vista Chinesa is not really a must go.",
          "This was one of the stops on the Tijuca Forest tour, which was an add-on to the favela tour. The gazebo and surrounding area are very nice, but the view is what you come for. This is a very nice complement to the view from Sugar Loaf, since you can see the other side of Rio",
          "After crossing an area of Atlatic forest, you reach a calm (and non paid) place where you are able to see the Corcovado, Rodrigo de Freita's Lagoon and Ipanema beach. Impressive!",
          "To my opinion the beauty of Rio is it views which are overwhelming and unique. This view point in Tijuca forest, provide probably the most unique view point from where youcan see the corcovado, the Shugarloff, the ilands, leblon and Ipanema etc and all from an altitude. Go there",
          "You can see all Rio HIghlights from a single points: Xsto Redentor, Sugar Loaf, Lagoa, Copacabana and Ipanema and Leblon Beaches.",
          "Nestled in a little corner surrounding the famous urban forest called Floresta da Tijuca, you can visit la Vista Chinesa which allows you to get the best views of the lake, Christ, Ipanema, Leblon and so forth. Don't forget your camera!",

          "This place is really cool. Unfortunately the day my husband and I were there it was so cloudy it was like being in the fog. On a clear day I understand you can see forever. We went on a Jeep tour up through the rainforest which was a total blast and highly recommended.",
          "A very nice view of Rio city you can have from here. There is a baved road to here which we took an uber to. The cost was around 20 BR$ from the two borthers mountain.\n\nWe took the hiking trail down to the city near Lagoa. It was a nice experience with lovely water runs along the way.",

        "wiki": "The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro or University of Brazil (Portuguese: Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ or Universidade do Brasil) is a public university in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. UFRJ is the largest federal university in the country and is one of the Brazilian centers of excellence in teaching and research. In terms of scientific, artistic and cultural productions it is recognized nationally and internationally due to the great teachers, researchers, reviews and assessments made by international agencies. In 2017 QS World University Rankings ranked UFRJ as the best Brazilian federal university, as well as the third best university in the country occupying the seventh position among institutions of Latin America. In 2016 and 2017 the Ranking Universit\u00e1rio Folha (RUF) ranked UFRJ as the best university in Brazil and the best Federal University in the country. The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) published in 2017 UFRJ as the second best university in the world in Zoology field.Brazil's first official higher education institution, it has operated continuously since 1792, when the \"Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho\" (Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, precursor to the university's current Polytechnic School) was founded, and served as basis for the country's college system since its officialization in 1920. Besides its 157 undergraduate and 580 postgraduate courses, the UFRJ is responsible for seven museums, most notably the National Museum, nine hospitals, hundreds of laboratories and research facilities and forty-three libraries. Its history and identity are closely tied to the Brazilian ambitions of forging a modern, competitive and just society.The university is located mainly in Rio de Janeiro, with satellites spreading to ten other cities. Its main campuses are the historical campus of \"Praia Vermelha\" (Red Beach) and the newer \"Cidade Universit\u00e1ria\" (College City), which houses the \"Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico do Rio\" (Technology Park of Rio) - a science, technology and innovation development cluster. There are also several off-campus units scattered in Rio de Janeiro: the School of Music, the College of Law Studies, the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences and the Institute of History, in downtown Rio; the National Museum and the Valongo Observatory (not to be confused with the National Observatory); and the high-school unit \"Col\u00e9gio de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Application College) in Lagoa. To the city of Maca\u00e9, located in the State's northern region, was dedicated a research and learning center focused on environmental issues and oil-related matters, and the city of Duque de Caxias, in partnership with the National Institute of Metrics, Normalization and Industrial Quality (Inmetro), saw the implementation of \"P\u00f3lo Avan\u00e7ado de Xer\u00e9m\" (Advanced Center of Xer\u00e9m), aimed at boosting research in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology.\nUFRJ is one of the main culprits in the formation of the Brazilian intellectual elite, contributing significantly to build not only the history of Rio de Janeiro but also of Brazil. Some of its former students include renowned economists Carlos Lessa and Mario Henrique Simonsen; Minister Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello; the architect Oscar Niemeyer; the philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger; the educator An\u00edsio Teixeira; the engineer Benjamin Constant; writers Clarice Lispector, Jorge Amado and Vinicius de Moraes; politicians Francisco Pereira Passos, Osvaldo Aranha and Pedro Calmon, besides the great physicians Carlos Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz and Vital Brazil.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Creation ===\n\nThe Federal University of Rio de Janeiro is a direct descendant of Brazil's first higher education courses. Created on September 7, 1920 (Brazilian Independence Day) by president Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa through the Law Decree 14343, the institution was initially named \"University of Rio de Janeiro\". Its history, however, is much vaster and parallel to that of the country's cultural, economic and social development (many of its courses trace back to the very foundations of Brazilian higher education system).In its inception, the university was composed by the \"Escola Polit\u00e9cnica\" (Polytechnic School, founded on December 17, 1792 as Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, during the reign of Portuguese Queen Maria I), the \"Faculdade Nacional de Medicina\" (National College of Medicine, founded on April 2, 1808, by Dom Jo\u00e3o VI under the name of Academy of Medicine and Surgery) and by the \"Faculdade Nacional de Direito\" (National College of Law, which came to exist after the fusion between the College of Legal and Social Sciences and the Free College of Law - both recognized by the Law Decree 693 of October 1, 1891).\n\nTo these initial units many others were progressively added, such as the \"Escola Nacional de Belas Artes\" (National School of Fine Arts) and the \"Faculdade Nacional de Filosofia\" (National College of Philosophy). Thanks to such achievements, the UFRJ toke crucial role in the implantation of Brazilian higher education, which was in fact an aspiration from Brazilian intellectual elite since the country's colonial era. Due to the longstanding tradition of its pioneering courses, the university functioned as the \"scholar mill\" upon which most of Brazil's subsequent higher education institutions were molded.\n\n\n=== Restructuring ===\n\nIn 1937, Get\u00falio Vargas's minister of education, Gustavo Capanema, announced a reform of the education system, under which the institution changed its name to the \"University of Brazil\". The change reflected the government's aim of controlling the quality of the national higher education system - mainly by setting a standard by which all other universities would have to conform. Such decision was strongly influenced by the French concept of university - that in which component schools are isolated in order to assume a specific professionalizing teaching method under strong state control -, which contrasted to the German model seen, for example, in the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, founded in 1934.The early 1950s marked the institutionalization of research in the university, which consequentially led to the implementation of research institutes, full-time academic staff, instruction of highly specialized professors and the establishment of partnership with national and international financing agencies.\nIn 1958, occasion for the 150-year anniversary of UFRJ's medicine school, the university was faced by the urgent needs of a structural reform that stimulated deeper participation and cooperation among professors and students with college affairs and a more rational, efficiency-based use of public resources. After an ample sequence of debates and public consultations, the resulting plans for reforms in University of Brazil were quickly absorbed by the scientific community, set a new standard for national college planning and influenced even, among others, Brazilian communication industries and government's decisional spheres.In 1965, under the government of general Castelo Branco, the university would achieve plain financial, didactic and academic autonomy - a condition called, according to Brazilian legislature, \"autarchy\" - and acquire its current name, which followed the still-active standard for federal university naming (i.e.: Federal University of name of State or region).After the reformation process, the university was propelled into a deeper and riskier restructuring phase that aimed to make the institution fit for the recently approved Law Decree of March 13, 1967 - a situation widely regarded as too bold for a nation with recent history as an independent territory and a culture that, inheriting traits from the Portuguese colonial rule, heavily emphasized tradition and stability.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\n\nThe UFRJ keeps an \"open-doors policy\" regarding foreigners who arrive at it to disseminate or accumulate expertise; this also allows for internship or job opportunities for its teaching staff in different institutions and areas of research. International interexchange and partnerships are profuse, leading to reformist tendencies that most of times successfully coexist with the university's strong traditional ties.The UFRJ adopts the Roman goddess Minerva - patroness of the Arts and all professions; also associated with knowledge and intellectuality - as its mascot, and many sculptures depicting the goddess are seem scattered throughout the institution. In 2000, the rectory requested to the Federal Justice that the university's name was changed back to \"University of Brazil\", as the old name has been changed by an arbitrary decree during the country's years of military dictatorship. The request was deferred, so it is correct to address the university by either names.\nThe university manages an ambitious program for extension courses, consisting mostly in providing full-time education to financially debilitated non-students of varying education backgrounds. Besides, the UFRJ contributes heavily to Rio de Janeiro's public health with its nine college hospitals, providing for over one thousand vacancies, and its deep integration with the State's health treatment network. In 2010, the institution achieved a \"very good\" evaluation and a maximum score in the Ministry of Education's General Index of College Courses (\"\u00cdndice Geral de Cursos\", or IGC in Portuguese). Its clear emphasis on research alludes to the personal motto of one of its most famous and distinguished scientists:In a university, one teaches because one researches.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nThe Federal University of Rio de Janeiro is an autarchy and a public institution linked to the Ministry of Education (MEC). Its administration is commanded by the superior councils: the \"Conselho Universit\u00e1rio\" (University Council), the highest decisional authority, presided by the \"reitor\" (rector); the \"Conselho de Curadores\" (Curators Council), responsible for the financial books and budgetary matters, also under rectorship rule; the \"Conselho de Ensino de Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Undergraduate Council), responsible for admission to undergraduate course and other undergraduate affairs, presided by the pro-rector of graduation; and the \"Conselho de Ensino para Graduados\" (Graduate Council), responsible for research activities and post-graduation courses, presided by the pro-rector of post-graduation and research.The institution is also directed by a vice-rector and six other pro-rectors. The rectors are nominated and chosen by the Ministry of Education (MEC) from a three-candidate list formed by a general election every four years. In general, the MEC respects the electoral decision, choosing the most voted candidate. The current rector (2014) is Carlos Ant\u00f4nio Levi da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, with Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9 Ledo Alves da Cunha as vice-rector.The academic pro-rectories are as follows: \"Pr\u00f3-reitoria de Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Pro-Rectory of Undergraduate Studies), \"Pr\u00f3-reitoria de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o e Pesquisa\" (Pro-Rectory of Research and Post-Graduate Studies), \"Pr\u00f3-reitoria de Planejamento e Desenvolvimento\" (Pro-Rectory of Planning and Development), \"Pr\u00f3-reitoria de Pessoal\" (Pro-Rectory of Human Resources), \"Pr\u00f3-reitoria de Extens\u00e3o\" (Pro-Rectory of Extension) e a Pr\u00f3-reitoria de Gest\u00e3o e Governan\u00e7a\" (Pro-Rectory of Management and Governance).\n\nServing as executive institutions are a total of eleven superintendencies: \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o\" (General Superintendency of Undergraduate Studies), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o e Pesquisa\" (General Superintendency of Research and Post-Graduate Studies), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Planejamento e Desenvolvimento\" (General Superintendency of Planning and Development), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Finan\u00e7as\" (General Superintendency of Finances), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Pessoal\" (General Superintendency of Human Resources), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Extens\u00e3o\" (General Superintendency of Extension), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Gest\u00e3o e Controle\" (General Superintendency of Management and Control), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Governan\u00e7a\" (General Superintendency of Governance), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Tecnologia da Informa\u00e7\u00e3o e Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o Gerencial\" (General Superintendency of Information Technology and Managerial Communication), \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Pol\u00edticas Estudantis\" (General Superintendency of Student Policies) e a \"Superintend\u00eancia Geral de Atividades Fora da Sede\" (General Superintendency of Non-Campus Activities).\n\n\n== Notable Rectors ==\n\nSome of the famous figures that have held the post of rector in UFRJ are: Benjamin Franklin Ramiz Galv\u00e3o, doctor, first-ever rector and former member of the Brazilian Academy of Literature(ABL); Raul Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, doctor; Pedro Calmon, former minister of Education and Health; Deolindo Couto, former member of the ABL; Raymundo Augustto de Castro Moniz de Arag\u00e3o, former minister of Education; Carlos Lessa, economist and former president of \"Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ\u00f4mico e Social\" (National Bank of Economic and Social Development, BNDS).\n\n\n=== Statistics & Heritage ===\nAccording to its yearly statistical report (2013), the university controls 52 units and supplementary departments, each linked to one of six academic centers. It has a total of 48 454 active undergraduate students plus 7 333 students in undergraduate online courses, and a yearly graduation rate of 5 381 students. As of post-graduation studies, there are 5 389 individuals undergoing master's degree and 5 5382 candidates for doctor's degree. Of its 3 821 professors, 3 068 hold a doctor degree, 618 are masters and 61 are specialists. In addition, its high-school unit (\"Col\u00e9gio de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o\", or Application School) accounts for 760 enrolled students.The university's main buildings are located at \"Cidade Universit\u00e1ria\" (College City, with 5.2 million m\u00b2) in \"Ilha do Fund\u00e3o\" (Backward Island), but the campus at \"Praia Vermelha\" (Red Beach, with 100 thousand m\u00b2) still gathers a plethora of units and supplementary departments. Additionally, there are the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences, the Institute of History, the College of Law Studies, the Valongo Observatory, the School of Music, the Residence of College Students and the National Museum (53 276 40 m\u00b2). Among the isolated health buildings there are the Maternity School, the S\u00e3o Francisco School-Hospital and the Anna Nery Nursery Schools. The UFRJ possesses additional campuses in Rio de Janeiro's Chile Avenue (8 550 m\u00b2), in the cities of Maca\u00e9 and Xer\u00e9m, in Itaguia\u00ed (149 869,18 m\u00b2), Jacarepagu\u00e1 (10 000 m\u00b2), Arraial do Cabo and in Santa Teresa (a 1.5 million m\u00b2 research-only wildlife reserve).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nUFRJ can be divided into six university centers plus the \"Escrit\u00f3rio T\u00e9cnico da Universidade\" (University Technical Department), the \"F\u00f3rum da Ci\u00eancia e Cultura\" (Forum of Science and Culture, FCC) and the University City Hall. Each center is made of dozens of units and supplementary organs responsible for education, research and extension in their respective areas of knowledge.\n\n\n=== University Centers ===\nCenter of Health Sciences (CCS): the university's largest, involved in activities and research related to biosciences. As a whole, it gathers ten units and fourteen supplementary organs: three hospitals, three \"nuclei\" (headquarters), two schools, three colleges and thirteen institutes. Activities are developed mostly at CCS's main building at College City, but there are also units at Praia Vermelha, in downtown Rio, in Maca\u00e9 and in Xer\u00e9m.\nCenter of Technology (CT): the university's second largest center, it manages two sprawling engineering schools and two high-tech research institutes, all located at College City. The CT also controls two business incubators and one foundation focused at technological studies. These units were all previous to the center's foundation, each with a unique history, and their performance is crucial to the national technological environment, given that together they form one of the country's most influential tech-poles.\nCenter of Mathematical and Natural Sciences (CCMN): originated from the traditional and influential National School of Philosophy, it is made of five institutes and one observatory. Its main infrastructure is located at College City. The Institute of Chemistry and the Institute of Physics are located at Center of Technology's Block A and the Institute of Mathematics, at its Block C, but both are units of CCMN. The Valongo Observatory is placed near the Mau\u00e1 Park, at the top of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, and it is the country's only federal institution to offer undergraduate course in Astronomy.\nCenter of Law and Economic Sciences (CCJE): responsible for activities concerning applied social sciences: administration, economics, law and urban planning. It gathers three units (schools) and two supplementary organs (institutes) scattered throughout College CIty, Praia Vermelha and downtown Rio.\nCenter of Philosophy and Human Sciences (CFHC): encompasses interdisciplinary academic activities regarding social sciences, especially those with theoretical focus on society formation. The CFCH is made of six units (two schools, one college and three institutes) and two supplementary organs (one headquarter and the Application College, which supports professor-training courses). The CFHC is locates mainly at the campus of Praia Vermelha, though some minor buildings are found in the regions of Largo do S\u00e3o Francisco and Lagoa.\nCenter of Literature and Arts (CLA): similar to the other centers, it was founded in 1967. It currently comprises four traditional units of UFRJ: two schools and two colleges focused on the arts, language and architecture. Its main buildings are placed at College City, except for the School of Music, which is located at downtown Rio.\nCOPPEAD Graduate School of Business (COPPEAD): The UFRJ School of the Business founded in 1973, located in its own building on the campus of UFRJ Fund\u00e3o Island is the only business school associated with a Brazilian public university that has international certification, whose is the only of Latin America listed among the 100 best in the world by the prestigious Financial Times ranking.\n\n\n=== Units and supplementary organs ===\nThe so-called \"units\" and \"supplementary organs\" are institutions of basically two types: schools/colleges, destined to professional training, research and extension; and institutes, destined to basic research, extension and teaching of a specific area of knowledge. Generally, units deal with undergraduate and postgraduate courses while supplementary organs are charged with coordinating disciplines according to each specific line of research. Additionally, there are \"research nuclei\", which fall into the category of \"supplementary organs\". As in most Brazilian universities, these two institutional sets are subdivided into departments.\n\n\n=== Libraries and museums ===\n\nKeeping important historical documents of both national and international relevance, UFRJ's libraries and museums can be considered the primary source of inquiry for the country's most renowned researchers. In 1983, the university implanted the System of Libraries and Information (SiBI), through which students and staff enjoy easy and speedy access to the entire collection of its forty three libraries. General (i.e. non-affiliated to the institution) digital access to UFRJ's libraries is made through the Minerva Base, a database that, much like the SiBI, gathers all university libraries into a single website.Among the most noteworthy museums and cultural spaces are: the National Museum, Latin America's largest museum and anthropological of natural history as well as Brazil's oldest scientific institution. Its building is a conversion from the Brazilian Imperial Family's old palace in \"Pa\u00e7o de S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o\" and it was founded by royal figure Dom Jo\u00e3o VI in 1818, but integrated to the university only much afterwards, in 1946. Brazil's emperor Dom Pedro II himself, an enthusiast for scientific knowledge, contributed to the museum's collection with Egyptian art, fossils, botanic species and many other items obtained by during his personal trips. Laboratories occupy a great portion of the museum and spread to some buildings raised in \"Horto Bot\u00e2nico\" (Botanic Garden), in \"Quinta da Boa Vista\".In Botafogo, the university also manages the \"Casa da Ci\u00eancia\" (House of Science), a cultural center of science and technology active since 1995 and dedicated to the exploration of languages and of popular forms of communication such as theater, music and audiovisual techniques. It performs periodical workshops and expositions opened to both students and the general public.\n\n\n=== Health complex ===\nThe university's medical-hospital network is composed of nine supplementary organs distributed throughout various campuses. Together, these units are responsible for 566 410 treatments, 8 293 surgeries and 18 555 hospitalizations every year.\nClementino Fraga Filho University Hospital (HUCFF): created in 1978, it is UFRJ's flagship medical institution. Sprawling through 110 000 meters squared, it is both national and international reference in high surgical procedures of high complexity.\nS\u00e3o Francisco de Assis Institute of Health (HESFA): founded in the 19th century as School Hospital and reopened in 1988 by then-rector Lu\u00eds Renato Caldas. Sustaining a profile of high-quality customer service clinic, it acts on medical procedures of low or medium complexity and focuses on patients requiring long-term care and hospitalization.\nInstitute of Psichiatry (IPUB): acts as Latin America's flagship research, post-graduation learning and knowledge-diffuser institution regarding multidisciplinary studies in psychiatry and mental health.\nMartag\u00e3o Gesteira Institute of Childcare and Pediatrics (IPPMG): institute of nationwide recognition in matters of childcare, it was incorporated to the university after formal proposal from professor Joaquim Martag\u00e3o Gesteira. It undergoes research in the mother-child field and acts on assistance and teaching and training in pediatrics.\nInstitute of Chest Diseases (IDT): founded in 1957 by professor Antonio Ibiapina and, since 2000, adjunct to HUCFF's main structure. Promotes full-time assistance and undergoes research regarding respiratory illnesses.\nDeolindo Couto Institute of Neurology (INDC): located at Praia Vermelha campus,  is responsible for activities, research, teaching and assistance in the fields of neurology and neurosurgery.\nInstitute of Gynecology (IG): founded in 1947 and located at university hospital \"Moncorvo Filho\". Notable for providing radio-therapeutic services specifically for matters of gynecology ontology.\nEdson Saad Institute of Heart (ICES): founded in 2003 to develop high-quality research in the fields of cardiology and vascular surgery. The institute initiated its activities in old departments from HUCFF and the School of Medicine.\nMaternity School (ME): founded in 1904 to assist pregnant women and newly-born children from unprivileged social backgrounds in the State of Rio de Janeiro. It was pioneer in the use of, among other methods, ultrasonography and dopplerfluxometry in Brazil.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\n\n=== Rio de Janeiro ===\n\nThe Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's main infrastructure is the College City, located at and occupying almost all of Ilha do Fund\u00e3o (Backyard Island), northern Rio de Janeiro. The island was artificially created in 1950 by the union of various already existing islands through embankment techniques. Academic activities in the campus, however, would only start in 1970, and the initial project stated that all active courses would be transferred to the City. Architecture was hugely influenced by modernism and some designs were even awarded, such as the rectory building (designed by Jorge Machado Moreira and awarded at the \"IV Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo\").The campus has a residence complex for undergraduate students (504 rooms), three university restaurants (commonly called \"bandej\u00f5es\", or \"big trays\"), a sports center, and banking agencies. In 2010, there was the opening of an integration station for the unified college transport system, aiming for more security and comfort to the college community. Dozens of 24/7 inter-campus bus lines, free for students, are connected to the College City, plus regular urban and intercity lines serving the population of Baixada Fluminense region and of metropolitan Rio de Janeiro.\nThe campus at Praia Vermelha (Red Beach), locates at Urca, southern Rio, concentrates on courses related mainly to human sciences. Its largest and most historically notable building is the University Pallace, a neoclassical-style premise built between 1842 and 1852 to serve as a hospice, which was inaugurated by emperor Dom Pedro II only ten years later. In 1949, the building was given to the University of Brazil, which then restored and expanded its facilities.\nIn downtown Rio de Janeiro, one can find many isolated college units: the College of Law Studies, at Conde dos Arcos Palace, former headquarter of Brazilian senate; the School of Music, planted in the old National Library building since 1913; the Valongo Observatory at the top of \"Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Hill); the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences and the Institute of History, both situated in the old National School of Engineering building, at \"Largo de S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula\".In the 2010-2020 UFRJ Master Plan a project was set for conversion of the Praia Vermelha campus into a great cultural center, consequentially transferring almost all of the campus' academic activities, plus that of all of college units scattered throughout Rio, to the College City, thus redeeming the City's original intent of centering all university activities in Ilha do Fund\u00e3o. The decision has generated strong polemic with both students and staff, given the great distances between southern (Praia Vermelha) and northern (Ilha do Fund\u00e3o) Rio and the chaotic traffic that plagues the Red Line of Jo\u00e3o Goulart Freeway - the \"jugular\" connecting the College City to Rio.Alo\u00edsio Teixeira, then rector and strong advocate for the integration, argued that the University Palace can bear a circulation of no more than two to three thousand people per day, and that the College City's major problems are not on its structure, but on its access points which are more easily fixable matters. Aiming to solve part of the City's traffic problem, in mid-2010 Rio de Janeiro saw the building of its first cable-stayed bridge, named \"Ponte do Saber\" (Knowledge Bridge), which was inaugurated in 2012 to receive a daily average of 25,000 vehicles.\n\n\n=== Duque de Caxias ===\nThrough its biophysics undergraduate course, started in the second half of 2008, UFRJ initiated activities in Xer\u00e9m, a region with large industrial and technological potential in the city of Duque de Caxias. Aiming to cooperate with Inmetro (National Institute of Metrics, Normalization and Industrial Quality), the university forged a partnership with the government of Duque de Caxias and with the Foundation for Technological Development and Social Policies. Currently, and additionally to biophysics, the Xer\u00e9m campus offers undergraduate courses in biotechnology and nanotechnology, both added in the first half of 2010. As of the following year, there was the addition of the professional masters in Scientific Formation for Biology Teachers, targeted at professors of the biosciences looking for skill improvement. Students have Inmetro's infrastructure and laboratories at hand, but most students and staff whose main laboratories are at Ilha do Fund\u00e3o still have to complete their academic internships at College City. In an attempt to fix this inconvenience, Inmetro agreed to concede its Xer\u00e9m infrastructures to UFRJ, which was then reinaugurated as a full campus in 2012.\n\n\n=== Maca\u00e9 ===\n\nUFRJ has operated in the city of Maca\u00e9 since the 1980s, when researchers from its Institute of Biology performed studies in the lakes of \"Regi\u00e3o dos Lagos\" (literally, Lake Regions). In partnership with the city, it instituted the Maca\u00e9 Nucleus for Ecological Researches (NUPEM) in 1994. The university's recognition in and importance to the city was so visible that, in 2012, the City Hall has donated to the institution a 29,000 m\u00b2 terrain, in which was raised a new university center. In 2005, NUPEM was officialized as a supplementary organ of the Center of Health Sciences and, in 2006, the university implemented its first course outside Rio de Janeiro, professor training in the biosciences, to be taken in NUPEM's headquarters. In 2007, Maca\u00e9 inaugurated a full university complex with two buildings and seven more planned ones, for graduation, post-graduation and extension courses. During this solemnity there was also the signing of the \"Protocolo de Inten\u00e7\u00f5es\" (Intensions Protocol) between UFRJ and the city, promising the initiation of chemistry and pharmacy courses in 2008.Currently, the campus is physically distributed among four poles (University Pole, Barreto, Novo Cavaleiros and Ajuda), where the following undergraduate courses are offered: biological sciences, chemistry, nursing and obstetrics, engineering (production, civil and mechanical), pharmacy, medicine, and nutrition; as of post-graduation courses, there are two: environmental and conservation sciences, and bioactive and biosciences products. The main campus was named after former rector Alo\u00edsio Teixeira, incumbent from 2003 to 2011, in 2012 (Campus UFRJ\u2013Maca\u00e9 Professor Alo\u00edsio Teixeira), honoring his decisive contribution to the spreading of UFRJ through the State of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== E-learning poles ===\nE-learning courses are offered by the CEDERJ (Rio de Janeiro Center of Higher-Education E-learning) consortium, signed between UFRJ and the following institutions: Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ), Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) and Centro Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ).Taught in a mixed scheme where some activities require the students' physical presence, UFRJ offers professor training courses in the biosciences, physics, and chemistry. At the course's conclusion, a student is awarded with a certificate equivalent to that of physically-based courses offered by the institution, according to each student's chosen e-learning pole. Admission are made by an independent \"vestibular\" organized by the consortium. UFRJ's e-learning poles in the State of Rio de Janeiro are: Angra dos Reis, Duque de Caxias, Itaperuna, Maca\u00e9, Nova Igua\u00e7u, Paracambi, Pira\u00ed, Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, Tr\u00eas Rios, and Volta Redonda.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Undergraduate courses ===\nThere are 179 undergraduate courses covering all areas of human knowledge and distributed into four types: morning, afternoon, night and integral (all previous three combined) courses. Each courses is linked to one academic institution, but some share multiple institutions, like the nanotechnology course, which is offered by the Polytechnic School, the \"Instituto de Biof\u00edsica Carlos Chagas Filho\" (Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho), the Institute of Physics and the \"Instituto de Macromol\u00e9culas Professora Eloisa Mano\" (Institute of Machomolecules Professor Eloisa Mano).\nBelow are listed all offered courses and the respective specializations (including emphases, habilitations or modalities) for which students can opt during their graduation.\n\n\n=== Postgraduate courses ===\nThere are 345 post-graduation courses, being 167 lato sensu (specialization) and 178 stricto sensu (master's and doctor's degrees). Similarly to the undergraduate courses, each post-grad course is linked to a specific academic institution. As of 2010, there were 1 965 scholarship programs from Coordination of Higher-Education Personnel Improvement (CAPES) available to post-graduation candidates, 844 from the National Council of Technologic and Scientific Development (CNPq) and 800 from the university itself.\n\n\n== Students ==\n\n\n=== Admissions ===\nSimilarly to most Brazilian public universities, admissions to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro are defined by highly competitive entrance exams held every year (commonly known in Brazil as \"vestibular\"). Anyone who was already graduated from high school is eligible to the undergraduate courses. Admission is also possible by transfer (known as \"external transfer\"), exemption from exams (\"reentrance\") or by international partnerships.\nUntil the late 1980s, the admission exam was managed as a unified \"vestibular\" by Cesgranrio Foundation. Given the university's disagreement with the test's methodology - which consisted almost entirely in multiple-choice questions -, the institution quit the partnership and organized its own \"vestibular\", named \"Concurso de Acesso aos Cursos de Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Undergraduate Courses Admission Exam). The test was solely based on open-ended responses, and its elaborate questions eventually led it to be considered one of Brazil's toughest and most demanding higher education admission exams.Since 2012, the university responded favorably to the utilization of the \"Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio\" (High School National Exam, or ENEM; a yearly nationwide exam managed by the Ministry of Education) for student admission. The exam's importance grew to the point that, in 2011, the UFRJ extinguished its \"Concurso de Acesso\" and made the ENEM its single admission exam; candidates' selection was delegated to the \"Sistema de Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Unificada\" (Unified Selection System, or SiSU; also under the Ministry of Education's rule). UFRJ quickly became one of the most coveted institutions in the system: as of the second semester of 2012, it received 103 829 applications, the highest of any other university in SiSU.The institution also adheres to affirmative action policies since 2010: currently, 30% of all vacancies are reserved by some form of affirmative action measure; the most common basis for selection under this system is through socioeconomic standards, favoring students with public schooling backgrounds and whose families earn less than one and a half minimum wage (R$1 086/month, or roughly US$15/day, as of January, 2014).\n\n\n=== Notable alumni ===\nGiven its academic excellence, the UFRJ was home to some of the countries brightest minds in all fields of knowledge. What follows is a list of some of them:\n\nAnthropologists: Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, and Gilberto Velho\nArchitect: Oscar Niemeyer\nArtists: Ary Barroso, Vin\u00edcius de Moraes, M\u00e1rio Lago, \u00c2ngela Leal, and Ivan Lins\nBillionaires: Andr\u00e9 Esteves, Carlos Alberto Sicupira\nChemist: Otto Gottlieb\nDoctors: Vital Brazil, Carlos Chagas, Osvaldo Cruz, Carlos Chagas Filho, Herman Lent, and Mauricio Rocha e Silva\nEconomists:  Carlos Lessa, Joaquim Levy, Jose A.

The entity remained influential until its shutdown by the military regime of 1964\u201385, when dozens of union leaders, including student and then-president of DCE Mario de Souza Prata, were murdered. In the late-1970s, given a gradual political opening, academic centers such as the DCE were given permission to function once again. Among the students that participated in the DCE's reactivation are M\u00e1rio Furley Schimidt and some member of popular Brazilian comedy show Casseta & Planeta, like Marcelo Madureira, Beto Silva and H\u00e9lio de la Pe\u00f1a.\n\nTo the young students who, at dawn of September 23rd, 1968, in the National College of Medicine building, dared to resist the police forces of the military regime. The episode known as \"Massacre da Praia Vermelha\" is one of the most important events of the constant fight for academic autonomy. To them, our deepest admiration.\nBesides the DCE, minor academic centers (CAs) act as students representative organs for each course: the Carlos Chagas Academic Center for the College of Medicine, the Polytechnic School Academic Center of Engineering, the C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira Academic Center for the College of Law Studies, the Max Planck Academic Center for the Institute of Physics and the Academic Directory for the School of Chemistry, to cite the most notable.\nThe infamous episode known as \"Massacre da Praia Vermelha\" (Red Beach Massacre) was a hallmark the history of Brazilian student unions. At dawn of September 23, 1968, squads from the military government invading the old facility of then-National College of Medicine and savagely beat all students sheltered there. There was also massive depredation of public patrimony, as the action disenabled several of the College's laboratories and administrative sectors. Around 600 students were gathered to protest against the government's arbitrary and oppressive actions (ex.: the shutdown of DCE and UNE, the increase in meal prices) and to vindicate the release of Law student Rodrigo Lima, arrested for 35 days in the \"Batalh\u00e3o de Guardas do Ex\u00e9rcito\" (Army Squad Battalion).\n\n\n== Technological Park of Rio ==\n\nThe Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico do Rio (Technological Park of Rio) is also located in College City. It is a technopole geared towards research in energy, oil, and gas. In partnership with Petrobras, UFRJ intends to convert an area of 350 000 m\u00b2 into the world's largest oil-related technological research center, given that exploration and oil extraction from the recently discovered pre-salt layer fields is in urgent need of new, more affordable techniques. Intense private and state investments in the region, plus the high expectations it has generated, led it to be considered a Brazilian \"Silicon Valley\". The park gathers, among its main facilities:\n\nLeopoldo Am\u00e9rico Miguez de Mello Research Center (CENPES): founded in 1962 and managed by Petrobras, it is responsible for research and development (R&D) and for the company's basic engineering matters; it is the largest oil research pole in the southern hemisphere.\nElectric Energy Research Center (CEPEL): founded in 1974, it is part of group Eletrobr\u00e1s and manages R&D related to the generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy. It is also the hemisphere's largest research center in the field.\nMineral Technology Center (CETEM): founded in 1978 and under direct command by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI), it acts on the technological development concerning to minerals.\nGeneral Electric Global Technological Center (GE): under construction, with inauguration planned to 2014. Until then, General Electric operates in the facilities of the Center of Excellence in Communication and Information Technology (CETIC).\nAlberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Post-Graduation and Research in Engineering (COPPE): UFRJ's supplementary organ, it is Latin America's largest research and learning center of engineering. Also notable for owning the world's largest (volume terms) and deepest oceanic tank, which is used to simulate sea-life conditions.Additionally, there is the Center of Excellence in Natural Gas (CEGN), the Institute of Nuclear Engineering (IEN), the Nucleus of Ecosystem Recovery Technologies (NUTRE) and a virtual reality center linked to the Laboratory of Computational Engineering Methods (LAMCE). Among the corporations with research units established in the Technological Park or in other spots of College City are: L'Or\u00e9al, Siemens AG, Usiminas, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, FMC Technologies, Repsol YPF, Halliburton and Tenaris Confab. Public biddings for the construction of new research centers and commercial tower, all capable of supporting one hundred new more enterprises, are currently under request. The Park project has also attracted over 200 small or medium-sized companies to its centers, resulting in higher stakes for its innovational potential.\n\n\n== Projects ==\n\n\n=== UFRJ Newspaper ===\nThe \"Jornal da UFRJ\" (UFRJ Newspaper) is a monthly publication by the General Superintendence of Social Communication. It has been on circulation since 2003, covering subjects of academic interest and government affairs. It is available both on print and digitally, with 25 000 copies being distributed across the universities many campuses.\n\n\n=== UFRJ Sea ===\nThe \"UFRJ Mar\" (UFRJ Sea) was developed along Rio de Janeiro's coastline and comprehends several fields, from physical education and engineering to biological sciences and geosciences. The project relies on one of Brazil's most complex set of R&D laboratories in maritime and coastal studies.\n\n\n=== Getting to Know UFRJ ===\nThe \"Conhecendo a UFRJ\" (Getting to Know UFRJ) is a two-day yearly event that takes place at College City, when high-school students have lectures about the institution, tour through its main campus and get to know its academic routine and student life. As of 2010, on its eighth edition, approximately 14 000 students participated in the event.\n\n\n=== Plant Waves ===\nDeveloped by COPPE with Government of Cear\u00e1 supporting Pec\u00e9m Wave Power Plant is the first in Latin America and places Brazil in a select group of countries with knowledge to extract electrical energy from sea waves. Factory with 100% Brazilian technology, is located 60 km from Fortaleza in the breakwater of the Port of Pec\u00e9m. The project of researchers from COPPE underwater Technology Laboratory is designed in modules which allows the expansion of the capacity of the plant.\n\n\n=== MagLev Cobra ===\nThe Maglev Cobra is a levitation train developed at UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) by Coppe (Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Graduate Studies and Research in Engineering) and the Polytechnic School by LASUP (Superconducting Applications Laboratory). The Brazilian train, as well as the German maglev floats on the tracks, with only friction with air during their displacement. Maglev Cobra based on levitation, moving without friction with the ground by a linear motor primary short. The vehicle has been designed towards a revolution in public transportation through high-tech, non-polluting way, energy efficient and affordable to large urban centers.\nThe deployment cost of Maglev Cobra is significantly lower than the subway, getting to cost only one-third of this. Its operating normal speed will be within a range of 70 to 100 km/h, compatible to the subway and ideal for urban public transport.\n\n\n=== LabOceano ===\nAble to reproduce the main features of the marine environment and simulate phenomena occurring in water depths greater than 2000 meters, LabOceano is a strategic technological support for Brazil, which has more than 90% of its oil reserves concentrated at sea, and for the oil and shipping industries. The ocean tank holds 23 million liters of water and its height corresponds to an eight-story building. Today, only two facilities in the world exist with similar characteristics to the tank designed by COPPE researchers: the Marintek, Norway, 10 meters, and Marin, Holland, 10.5 meters.\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nLaw School\nMuseu Nacional (National Museum)\nCasa da Ci\u00eancia (House of Science)\nCAp UFRJ (Laboratory School)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEducation in Brazil\nBrazil University Rankings\nUniversities and Higher Education in Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Federal University of Rio de Janeiro at Wikimedia Commons\nUFRJ Official website (in Portuguese)",

          "It\u2019s an art gallery like many others in the world. When we went it had a history of Samba, which was really interesting provided you used Google translate as everything was in Portuguese. The other floors had different exhibitions and they were pretty good.",
          "This museum has several floors of exhibits, all interesting. They had a samba exhibit while we were there complete with music. It would be nice if there were explanations in English or Spanish.",

          "Heavy rain spoiled my beach plans so headed to the museum instead. Interesting exhibits and some great art in here. Mostly in Portuguese so bring your Google translate, but still worth your time. Big bags not allowed inside but there is a free bag check. Take cameras and enjoy!",
          "A nice art museum with good exhibitions. On one floor they had a really thorough exhibition about Samba in Brazil and in Rio. You could learn a lot about the history and cultural importance if Samba. On the other floors it had different art exhibitions from Brazilian artists",
          "We set out to visit other landmarks in the area and luckily ended up at MAR, which features great architecture, excellent views and a lovely museum restaurant. When we were there, there was an exhibit about samba, which was truly amazing and helped us understand the city better.",

          "I had high hopes, but I was disappointed. Luckily it was pretty cheap when bought with the Museu da Amanha ticket. Decent view from the top. The coolest part was the favela model, but you can see that on the ground without even buying a ticket. A lot of videos in the exhibits.",
          "What I liked the most on this museum is that you can interact with art on the exhibitions. I bought the tickets online for both Museu do amanh\u00e3 and MAR for R $32,00. Its location, price and view are excellent!",

        "wiki": "The Marine Aquarium of Rio de Janeiro (Portuguese: Aqu\u00e1rio Marinho do Rio de Janeiro), or AquaRio, is a public aquarium located in the Gamboa neighborhood, in the port zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. With a constructed area of about 26,000 square metres (280,000 sq ft), it is located to the west of Muhammad Ali Square. It is considered the largest marine aquarium in South America.It was inaugurated on October 31, 2016, in a ceremony that was attended by the former minister of Tourism, Marx Beltr\u00e3o. The public aquarium was made at Porto Maravilha, an urban operation that aims to revitalize the Port Zone of Rio de Janeiro.\nThe building occupied by AquaRio has a total of 5 floors and 28 tanks with various types of fish. In the tanks, about 4.5 million liters of salt water are stored, in addition to 8 thousand animals of 350 different species. The building formerly belonged to Companhia Brasileira de Armazenamento (Cibrazem), now Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (CONAB).\n\n\n== Main features ==\n\nAquaRio brings together about 8,000 animals from 350 different species from all oceans. Among the main species present in the aquarium are: the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum); the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus); the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus); and the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). The fish are distributed in 28 enclosures, which gather a total of 4.5 million liters of salt water.In addition to the visit to the tanks, AquaRio allows the visitor to perform the following additional activities, subject to charge separately: \"Sleeping in AquaRio\", where the visitor can spend a night in the tunnel that passes in the middle of the Great Ocean Tank; the \"Diving of the Ocean Tank\", where the visitor can dive into one of the tanks;  the \"Virtual Fish\", where the visitor can create a virtual friend at the beginning of the tour and interact with him along the circuit; \"Behind the Scenes\", where the visitor can see up close the equipment that treat the water of the enclosures, the work of the biologists and the way of realizing the feeding of the fish.\nThe AquaRio visitor can also enjoy the following attractions: the Virtual Aquarium, a digital aquarium with fish created by visitors; the Science Museum, composed of the Plankton Station and the Shell Exhibition; Surf, a space dedicated to the surf elaborated by the surfer Rico de Souza. As part of its structure, AquaRio has a caf\u00e9, a scientific research center, a parking lot and a souvenir shop, including some kiosks.\n\n\n=== Solar roof ===\nOn May 31, 2016, the largest solar roof installed in urban areas of Brazil was inaugurated at AquaRio. Comprising about two thousand solar panels installed in an area of 6 thousand m\u00b2, the solar roof will generate about 77 thousand kilowatts of energy per month, equivalent to the monthly consumption of 500 Brazilian homes. The roof reduces the consumption of electricity consumed by the aquarium by up to 30%.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTourism in Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "It wasn't Riley's Aquarium or anything else but it was an amazing experience nonetheless. I see reviews complaining about the organization/collection but it was beautiful. They had a massive main tank where you can go underwater, and a gorgeous collection of fish of all colors",
          "Went to the aquarium with my husband and two young daughters. Bought the tickets online for a specific date and time. However, I had the impression that if I had gone at another time during the day, it would have been ok. Nobody checked. The overall experience is great,",
          "Amazing place to visit on any given day. This is the largest salt water aquarium of south America. Here you have the opportunity to learn, visit and appreciate sea life in many forms. The tunnel at the biggest tank is just amazing. 9/10 would definitely visit again. A great",
          "We planned to spend a few hours here on a rainy day but despite it's rumor as south American biggest aquarium it isn't particularly big nor impressive. A walkthrough would take 20-30 minutes at most. The habitats created for the animals weren't particularly large or",
          "I loved it. They also have the wax museum right there. It is worth it to see both in the same trip. Very nice and modern. Enjoy it.",
          "Having been to several of the world's best aquariums, and many lackluster ones as well, AquaRio falls closer to the low end in terms of collection while the higher-than-average cost of admission further compromises the experience. Impressive at first, a kid-friendly foyer",
          "This aquarium is the largest in South America but not as large at the Atlanta, National or New England Aquariums. It is a good place to escape the heat for 1.5 to 2 hours and would be great if you have small children. It has a nice layout and good collection but it could be",
          "We decided to go the aquarium on a holiday. It was so crowded! But walked thru the tunnel under the water was very exciting! Kids there were very happy and we ended up having a good time too. If you have time and kids, definitely have to go there.",

          "We decided to go here on a day when it was rainy. It was a pretty long walk from some other museums in the area. We were very unimpressed with this place. To be fair we have been to some really nice aquarium including many in the United States like New Orleans, Chicago, and San",
          "Let's start with the positive points: it's pretty easy to buy tickets on their website and there's a nice little transparent underwater tunnel from which visitors get a nice look at the fish. However, this place is only considered a significant tourist attraction in the city",

          "If you have more than the usual amount of days to spend in Rio, and if you find that the weather forecast isn't very good, this could be an interesting visit. Make sure to add it as part of a port area tour. The light-rail line stops by the aquarium.",
          "I was expecting a lot from the famous aquarium of Rio de Janeiro but I must admit I was a tad disappointed. The place is far to small for the amount of visitors it gets, which means you spend most of you time behind countless people taking photos and selfies in front of the",

          "And in my opinion the best aquarium together with the aquarium in S\u00e3o Paulo. Very big and very increadible. If you go during the week you can touch manta and sea star. You can buy online ticket that is cheaper than in place.",

          "I went to the aquarium with my fiance on a Sunday morning. I wish i would've saved my money. 1st of all they allow wayyyy too many people inside the aquarium at one time. This is my major issue with the place. Was very difficult to see the tanks as there was a crowd of people in",
          "I went there with my boyfriend on a Sunday and we were super excited. The prices were quite expensive compared to other attractions in Rio, but the real problem was how many people they allow to go in at the same time.. It was IMPOSSIBLE to see the fishes, there were thousands",
          "One very decent big tank but the rest is camped and far from generous in space, no out of the ordinary stuff to see and a lot of digital experiences that you could easily have at home. It\u2019s a huge building which seems to be mostly dedicated to parking and a pretty large exit",
          "It is a wonderful aquarium, the place is calm with powerful air conditioning permits a very enjoyable visit to wonderful world of fish and sharks. There\u2019s biologists to explain several interesting aspects of ocean life. Just At beginning if the visit there is a interesting",
          "During weekdays the Aquarium is not crowded, you can stop in front of each aquarium and enjoy the fishes, try the experiments at the virtual groves, touch the fishes, etc. About the fishes touching I was expecting a bit more. The tanks are large and the fishes stays out of reach",

        "wiki": "The Largo do Botic\u00e1rio (Apothecary's Square) is a square in the Cosme Velho neighborhood of the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The square can be reached by the Beco do Botic\u00e1rio (Apothecary's Alley), that passes by the Carioca River. The area is characterized by large, neo-colonial houses and Atlantic Forest vegetation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of the alley and square are derived from Joaquim Lu\u00eds da Silva Souto, apothecary, who had an establishment on the old Rua Direita, today's Rua Primeiro de Mar\u00e7o in downtown Rio. Apothecary Silva Souto was very successful, even treating members of the royal family. He bought land in the Cosme Velho neighborhood and moved there around 1831. In 1846, marshal Joaquim Alberto de Souza Silveira\u2014a frequent visitor to the royal court\u2014lived there and author Machado de Assis was his godfather.\nThe defining feature of the square appeared in the 1920s. Edmundo Bittencourt, founder of the newspaper   Correio da Manh\u00e3, bought the property and began to build neocolonial houses. This trend continued into the 1930s and 1940s with the help of diplomat, architect, art collector, and resident, Rodolfo da Siqueira. Sylvia de Arruda Botelho Bittencourt her husband Paulo inherited the Correio da Manh\u00e3, moved into the square, and assisted with its preservation. Some of the original houses near the square were refurbished by modernist architects like Lucio Costa and Gregori Warchavchik, using original materials authentic to the colonial era salvaged from demolition projects around the city.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nDuring its \"golden age\", the Largo do Botic\u00e1rio became filled with huge houses owned by well-known figures in Brazilian society and foreigners attracted by the parties and social events held by the neighborhood's illustrious residents. Currently, however, the once-decadent area has fallen into decay. Between 2006 and 2008, one of the houses was taken over by a group of homeless people.\nThe Largo do Botic\u00e1rio is one of the few places in the city from which one can see the Carioca River. Near the square, several other historic sites in the Cosme Velho neighborhood can be found, including the Solar de Abacaxis house and the Corcovado Railway. In the 1970s, the square was featured in a scene in the movie Moonraker.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "back in the day this area was real bad, but after the olympics it has changed drasticaly which is great, this boulevard is between the museum do amanha and the aquarium, both locations are worth to visit and between them you can enjoy the train ride or the walk in the boulevard,",
          "These murals are close to the cruise ship port. We were told they in the Guinness Book of Records. They beautifully depict the indigenous tribes of the five continents. This is a nice area for walking around anyway but these paintings really beautify the neighborhood.",

          "Walking down the Boulevard there are various art murals however what impressed me most were the ones by Kobra. The faces and colourful design were really interesting and I spent a few moments sat on the bench in front of them admiring his work. Worth a quick trip here to see.",
          "The murals were interesting with the various faces of the natives. It was a master piece of work. The murals was just across the cruise terminal. It is reachable by public transportation the bus stops just in front of the mural.",

          "It is many years since my last visit, when the dockside areas were a shambles with dilapidated buildings and not a very safe place to walk. The 2016 Olympics has enabled all this to change. It now has orderly armazems (warehouses) and shipping terminals and for Carnavale 2017",
          "On our last afternoon our guide Gus to us to visit this part of Rio especially to view this amazing piece of art work. It was done by an artist \"Kobra\" - clearly a genius we have never seen such and amazing mural. It stretches for ages and made of significant peoples of the",

          "This was a great thing to see in Rio. If you are into Art and culture then this is the place to go. I'm not even particularly fussed about these things but when you see the magnitude of the Art work you will be able to appreciate is",
          "Unfortunately these wonderful tribal paintings will disappear some when they demolish the old factory wall. They are though well worth seeing so hurry",
          "It's a bit of a walk from the main street where your taxi can drop you off but it's worth visiting. The murals are a sight worth seeing and they're HUGE!!!",
          "This is the biggest graffiti mural in the world painted by the world famous graffiti artist Kobra for the Olympic Games, and it is absolutely incredibly beautiful, a real work of art. Pity it will only last about 5 years, so hurry up and go and see it!",
          "Big long piece of graffiti ... surely there is a lot of work into it. The walk to this boulevard is new and very nice. FYI, The second lady is the tribe lady from the northern part of Thailand!!",

          "This place was created as part of the Olympic games in Rio. The best way to acess it is to take the subway to Uruguaiana station, visit Candelaria church and then walk for 10 minutes. Or you can stop at Carioca station and commute to a tram . The boulevard starts at Pra\u00e7a Maua",

          "Set up for the Olympics and after this has plenty of action going on. People come and just mingle, eat, roller blade, ride bikes. Relaxing with entertainment some times. However this can be a bit too loud at times.",
          "One of most full-places with art I have been on Rio. There are too many arts, is easy to take the VLT to access the subway service and of course, you can go walking at streets, it's secure! I recommend to visit this place during the day because there's a typicals foodtrucks and",
          "A good bit that's interesting, but it's rather too spread out. Worth taking the tram, so you can hop on and off as you see bits you'd like a closer look at. Not sure how good it will be post-Olympics. Ciudad de Samba - excellent! Get in if you can, and take your camera. I",
          "Although the place is beautiful anytime, I think sunlight and shadows make it more interesting at sunset (or at dawn). Have a meal in the restaurant at the top floor of MAR (Museu de Arte do Rio), enjoy your afternoon around or in Museu do Futuro and after dusk go to Lapa to",
          "A lot of Attractions to see and cool things to absorb all around you. Fun Place for people watching and a great place to relax and take in all the sight and sounds. In my opinion you'll want to spend a lot time here. I hope that Rio is able to maintain this place in years to",
          "Now that the dust has settled and the Olympics are over, it's a relatively quiet place now. Some people but no crowds. Nice to see. The moving sculpture is something I have never seen before and worth going just for that!",
          "Amazing what the place has become. Rio did an incredible job cleaning up and restoring an important part of the city. The murals are outstanding. Nice walk around the area. Still need to create more food area. The food trucks nearby do a well done job.",

          "There is lots to see in the Boulevard Olympico. Be warned, you do need to pre-book online to enter the museum, but if you haven't, it's an extraordinary, beautiful piece of architecture, more like an enormous sculpture than a building. You can walk all round it, and there are",

Along there are different places to enjoy, the lovely view to Ilha das Cobras, the Museu de Amanh\u00e3 and Museu do Rio among other things. Definitely",

          "This is a great stadium to visit if you are in Rio. It is not only a stadium but it has a lot of great history too. There is a lot to see and a tour of this stadium is a must.",
          "We had a behind-the-scenes trip organised thru the tour company where you get taken in thru the players entrance. Grand and colourful stadium, we were disappointed that we couldn't purchase any football jerseys (the outside ones were fake).",
          "I turned up on the morning of a Flamengo match; alas no tickets. Next time. As I was there I paid RS80 for a stadium tour. Well worth it to see this truly great stadium. You get access to the dressing room, the dugout and the stands. Excellent fun!",
          "Attending a big game between Flamingo and Flumininze football clubs. The atmosphere is magical and the organization going in and out is very good considering the huge number of spectators",
          "The soccer temple!!!! World Cup scenario twice and one of the biggest structure built in Rio. Visit the bench and the field. And all the other places the players went to.",
          "Travelled here with Hubby who is a soccer Fan. Can buy the jerseys of the teams that play here. We did a tour without the guide-Pay extra for the Guide. Air Con is good on a warm day to cool down Great info points available and info on the Great Brazilian Players",
          "If Flamengo plays at the Maracana when you're in Rio you can't afford to miss it. One of the best football experiences ever.",
          "Didn\u2019t do the stadium as a tour went and saw a soccer game. If in Rio and there is a game on I highly recommend going to it. One of the best experiences I have witnessed.",
          "This is the most disappointing and misleading tour I have ever experienced. I strongly recommend to book with another company and NOT Gray Line Tours if you are concerned about your safety and getting to watch the game until the end. Pick up was organised for 17:10, to which",
          "I did visit the stadium in March 2019 during the day when it was empty. However, real experience is to go there during the real match when local team Flamengo is playing. Over 65.000 people normally visiting this games and the atmosphere is amazing. I do not like soccer itself,",
          "Let\u2019s start at the ticket office. Utterly unhelpful, didn\u2019t care and \u2018not bothered\u2019 This continued with all the staff throughout this \u2018tour\u2019. With the exception of the young lady on the entrance turnstile. They have plonked, yes plonked a bunch of shirts and balls for you to",
          "If you love football and you are in Rio, this is a must visit activity. For me it was extra special because the Red Devils from Belgium had beaten Brazil in the quarter finals in the world cup and the same Red Devils had beaten Russia in this stadium in 2014. Everyone knows",
          "We've been lucky enough to go round some pretty spectacular tours in our time and this one by far is the worst. I was absolutely gobsmacked there was no replica ground of the old Maracana so we could have seen what it looked like as they claim it held 200,000 people, there's no",
          "We arrived outside entrance A in an Uber and walked 2 mins to ticket office. Easy to buy ticket and followed advice and didn\u2019t book tour just entrance fee 55 R each - which was the best choice as all areas are clearly marked in English and didn\u2019t have to wait for tour guide to",
          "Visit when a match is being played for the complete experience. The tour doesnt do justice. The vibe and feeling of a live match is important to taste the Brizalian passion for football. Tickets only 10reals",
          "When we took a day tour in Rio we stopped at the Maracana stadium. The stadium was empty and almost no one was there so we lacked the atmosphere when a match is taken. We saw in the front of the stadium the statue of the past famous football player H. Bellini swings the Jules",
          "Brazilians love their football. Average stadium. Affordable seating. Closer = wetter due to open roof. A little chaotic outside afterwards, so plan ahead for a ride.",
          "During our stay in Rio we were fortunate enough to have a home derby scheduled at the Maracan\u00e3. The atmosphere was incredible and the home fans were all very friendly. Unfortunately the game finished in a draw but this didn\u2019t detract from the experience! The main concern for",
          "We watched Fluminese play Santos, very special experience. Pity the fans stayed away, was a nice match. Stadium is refurbished and decent food.",
          "As part of a tour we stopped outside for photos. There are guys standing around the statue of Bellini at the front with a trophy trying to get money for you taking photos with their trophy. Just not into stadiums so I wouldnt bother.",
          "I am a huge fan of sports and love visiting sporting stadiums around the world. The Maracana tour offers a great insight into one of the greatest football stadiums. My tour guide did a great job conducting the tour in English, Spanish and Portuguese. She was well informed and",

          "There was no tour guide around on the day we visited so we opted for the standard entry ticket. There are a few bits of memorabilia and access to rooms however certainly not as much info is provided compared to other stadiums I have visited. Price is overpriced for what you get.",
          "Good to see part of the city famous places and history Was also part of the tour I had and if you go alone you can walk around as well, plenty of shops in the area",
          "We only saw from the outside..so it's hard to visualize inside part!! As it is the only large stadium in Brazil with more capacity for standing and watching the game is something to cheer about..",
          "It was raining out and I was in route to another place. And my driver had brought me near the stadium. The stadium is one of the largest in South America being able to hold a large bunch of wild and crazy football fans in South America, in Brasil it futbael, in US it\u2019s soccer",
          "Not being a portueguese speaker, I paid the entrance to vist this world famous football stadium and wonder around by myself. The stadium having hosted many famous football matches and being involved in the Olympics is easily accessible from the Maracana metro station. The",
          "As a huge football fan this was a must see, and compared to other stadia disappointing in the access areas. Some interesting historical memorabilia and ofcourse seeing the pitch, dug out and stadium were great, had hoped to experience more around trophies, back room areas.",
          "We loved our experience with Raul, who guided us expertly to Maracana Stadium to cheer on the Flamengo team! We tried to get tickets in the US - but it's very hard to navigate - Raul communicated everything we needed to know - we met him at the designated spot - there were about",
          "A visit in Maracana is visiting the essence of Brazilian soul. The stadium is of course renovated and modernized and is not the same field that Pele used to play. You pay an entrance fee and you can either take a guided tour or visit yourself depending on the time you have. You",
          "We went to a game, not the stadium tour. The atmosphere was outstanding, and very safe. If a match lines up while you're in town, I recommend going. There are tours that will arrange tickets and transportation for you.",
          "Was pretty disappointed. We have been to many stadiums and this was by far the most run down. There was not very much to see or do. It was quite far out from where we were staying in Copacabana Beach and was only there for a maximum of 40 minutes.",
          "We went to the quarterfinals cup match here and wow, what an experience! I\u2019m not a football fan myself - my kids wanted to go - but nevertheless it\u2019s an unforgettable occasion. The atmosphere is electric. Everyone stands for the entire game, including in the aisles and",
          "Arrived st the stadium in the afternoon for a tour only to find out that due to a match that night, they closed the stadium museum tour early. We tried to take photos outside and was met by unfriendly security personnel (who didn\u2019t let us peek inside the stadium to take a photo)",
          "Went to see a football match. Enjoyable day. Tickets were easy to purchase at the window (but it was a local match). I only wanted to feel the stadium and I did get that.",
          "Book the tour without any guide. It was better than going with a group. The stadium doesnt have much to see. But it's well maintained and sufficient enough for me. The grandstand area is not crowded. So you can take photos without much people in the background. The staffs were",
          "I was slightly let down by this. Huge and fabulous stadium but not sure it was worth the guided tour. I have done many stadium tours for different sports arounds the world. The guided tours normally cover a lot more and you get to see so much including dressing rooms and",

          "We went there to watch the game between Flamengo vs Botafogo. The game was awesome and the supporters are amazing, everyone is to 200% behind there team and you can feel it. Very nice experience, just recommend it! We were in block D and the tickets were not expensive (15\u20ac) to",
          "This is what I call football, really amazing, nothing compared with Europe. The team crowd of both teams were literally breathtaking, it was crowded. We went with our kids, secure, and easy to find and to get there by yourself.",

          "This is a big football stadium in Rio de Janeiro. It was rebuilt for the 2013 FIFA CONFEDERATIONS CUP. It was opened with a lot of fanfare. Today it is used for matches. The day we went there it was deserted as there was no match. It is a huge stadium and could hold nearly",

          "I booked through my hotel a trip to watch Fluminese play at the Maracan\u00e3. The game was good and transport etc to the match was fine and perfectly safe. Due to the size of the stadium we achieved an overal attendance of 12,000. However the stadium can hold close to 70,000 (I",
          "So for me, the maracana, wembley and old trafford are as big as it gets for football. I went to my first ever football match here. Santos vs Flamengo. It was amazing. Fans were singing all 90 minutes Downside was that the staff were quite rude. My mum and I bought tickets",

          "One of the best atmospheric games I've ever been to. The stadium was only half full but still the crowd was rowdy and joyous. Great experience!",

          "The tour of this famous Stadium with a guide costs 65R for adults, or 32.50R for children and seniors. You can also do your own wandering for a bit less. The guide for the tour spoke in Portuguese, Spanish and English. It was a large group, so it took over an hour, but it's",
          "We did stadium tour on 24 April 2019 & as football fans it was great to visit this iconic stadium , to see where 2014 world cup final was played , along with greats like Pele who scored his 1000th goal here. What was surprising was the basic changerooms if compared to English ,",
          "As a small child I lived in Brazil. All my life I've wanted to see my favorite team (Flamengo) play here. It's a shrine to Brazilian soccer. I was surprised that it was well organized and relatively clean for such a large sports venue. The game I went to watch was a big game",
          "If you are knowledgable about the Brazil national team you may not learn a lot but it had lots of good memorabilia. Going to a game is another story altogether. We went to watch Flamengo vs San Jose in a Coppa Libertadores match and the atmosphere was sensational, I'd recommend",
          "What do you associate with Brazil? Nuts? Beaches? Carnival? Of course but there is something far more important than the above. The famous Liverpool Manager Bill Shankly once stated that football was more important than life and death and a visit to the Magic Maracana is up",
          "We wet to a game at the Maracan\u00e3 and the atmosphere was electrifying and full of excitement. My grandson had a hamburger and got a very bad food poisoning thus we lost at least a full day of visits. So be aware.",
          "We saw Flamengo and Fluminense play, Saturday, 6th of April. What an atmosphere! We bought tickets online, got picked up by bus in Copacabana, tour guide gave us a great rundown on the way about the history behind the 2 teams. A drink and hot dog was included in the price.",
          "Ok, we watch Flamengo vs. some other team, and if you are going to buy tickets at the booth before the match, show up EARLY! I mean, I am sure that some people in line only got there for half time. As well, they only take cash, so do not listen to people who say you are all good",
          "We went on the tour the day before a match. To be honest I wouldn\u2019t bother with the tour. Try and go to a match instead.",
          "I was excited to learn that one of our tour stops was going to be the Maracan\u00e3 stadium. Unfortunately, they only let us hop off the bus and take pictures in front of the statue for about 5 minutes!!! :( Definitely wouldn't recommend such a brief fly by.....I should have checked",
          "I'm not a huge football fan but didn't want to miss the opportunity to see the central football attraction in this Soccer Mad country. The stadium certainly is impressive and there are lots of opportunities for taking great photos. There is a choice of either having a guided",

          "We arrived and paid to get in. Only one gate that you can do that, but taxi knew where. It\u2019s obvious the amount of work that\u2019s gone into the stadium over the last few years as it was crumbling years back. Attendance of 199,000 at its prime, now only 87,000 and to be honest I",
          "Watched a match for the Rio state cup -interesting, very different from our English matches. Fantastic atmosphere!",

          "Worth to go there although it was rebuilt. Great stadium. The museum is quite small (the one in Sao Paulo is much better).",
          "For any person who is in love with football there is no description to provide, only with the Maracana name, you know what you go for. Even the museum is a really small one, its a good choice to visit (if you are a student take your student ID with you to get a better price",

You will visit the dressing room. media centre, shop and most of all be",

          "The visit is very nice, they have a small museum once you get in where you can see some shoes frok famous football players as well as tshits and foot prints, if you are a fan of soccer it is a must to visit , you can sit for a while and admire the new setting of blue and yellos",

          "We did not tour the stadium, but had the chance to watch a game here. Loved the experience with such passionate fans! We saw a local team play, so only 10% of the stadium tickets were sold. I thought all games would have tickets available for all of the seats. (This is",

          "Frankly this was a bit of a disappointment and they have really missed a trick in attracting visitors. The whole experience is a bit half-hearted and you cannot even buy a Pele football shirt. At all costs avoid the guided tour and do it yourself - the guide was boring and",
          "When in Maracana, check the visit schedule so you can get inside. Even if present in a lot of paid tours which you can buy from hotels, you can reach to the stadium via public transportation (like we did). Trust us, Rio is not insecure in the city as you may read in a lot of",

          "The stadium might seem a bit out of date, especially when compared to the ones in Europe. However, it's definitely worth at least seeing it from the outside if you don't fancy (or have time) visiting it. It's a place full of history (if you're into football)",
          "Only happy for have been here and feel all the emotion but your does not show the real of Brazilian football history.Only Garrincha has a figure in metal.No Pel\u0117,no Ronaldo,kaka.Plastic artist must contribute to this place and even famous players with more stuff to see.In",

          "We went to a Fluminense home match v Cerea. The vast stadium holds 76,000 but there were less than 6,000 in attendance on a rainy Monday night. It was 0-0 too! They do very good organised tours I understand.",

          "Highly recommend you do the stadium tour (it costs 60 BRL - $15) and gives you access to the team's locker room and a part of the pitch, including the dugout and fan seats. It also has a few personal items from legendary Brazilian footballers like Pele, Garrincha and Zico -",

          "We visited the stadium on a tour and were amazed at the size of it. Many vendors outside selling soccer memorabilia from t-shirts, caps, soccer balls, etc. A must see when in Rio de Janeiro!",
          "While visiting Rio de Janeiro did not want to miss the opportunity of watching a football (soccer) match in the iconic Maracana stadium where a local favourite team Flamengo was playing. Arranged the ticket with \u201cViator\u201d who also provided a hotel pickup and drop with a friendly",
          "Maracana stadium is where 2 World Cup finals were played. It was recently renovated for the 2014 World Cup and now holds up to 85,000 fans ( earlier it was almost double that as it was substantially standing only ) I went watch a football match on the Saturday evening I was in",
          "A must-visit if you're a soccer fan. I was with my son who wants to be a professional soccer player so we HAD to go...The tour is a bit expensive so I'd skip the visit unless you're truly into soccer. My son was VERY happy with the tour, though - so it was well worth it for us.",
          "This is an interesting stadium where the current d3sign has seen the capacity fall from the initial 200,000 to its current 80,000 seated. Probably mirrors the decline of Brazil's world stature in football.",
          "The stadium deserves a visit in great classics of the carioca soccer. The excitement and fervor of the fans for their teams during the games is indescribable. Enjoy and arrive early and pay a visit to the football museum.",
          "If you come to Rio, you should never miss one soccer game, ideally on a Sunday, in Maracan\u00e3 Stadium! It is an immense stadium; probably still the largest in the world... If you have a chance to watch \"the march of all matches\" in Rio - Flamengo x Fluminense - Or FLA x FLU... you",
          "If you come to Brazil and don\u00b4t come to Rio de Janeiro you can\u00b4t say you came here! But if you come to Rio you must attend a Flamengo\u00b4s game at Maracan\u00e3!!! That stadium is full of history of the most important soccer team of the world! You\u00b4ll find guided visits and walk where",
          "I saw 2 games here during my stay in Rio, absolutely 100 percent would recommend to catch one if you\u2019re a football fan and even if you aren\u2019t! The best atmosphere of any game I\u2019ve ever been too.",
          "This is one of the best icons Brazil can pride itself with and the activities that are happening outside are so exciting for one to enjoy the tour.",
          "If you get a chance to attend a game you have to try it. The stadium is huge, and not all that special on its own, but the vibe during games is unlike anything I've experienced before at a sporting event. The crowd was electric and into their team (Vasco de Gama). There were",
          "Attended a huge Flamengo game with my son. Stadium was clean and easy to maneuver. If you can attend a game, do it. Amazing experience. Stadium is nothing to exciting but the history and fans more than make up for it. Easy and safe to get to by Metro.",
          "Maracana stadium is iconic. If you get the opportunity to be there for a public-full match, between Flamengo and any other important team, don't hesitate - the thrill of entering the crowdy (and cheering) stadium is unforgettable. Just an advice - take care about security -",
          "I've got there to accomplish the desire of my son and friends. They love football a lot, and are very expert. Considering Brasil as the temple of football, Maracana' has to be the Olympus with Juppiter inside ! An attraction tell me the neverending story of the Brasilian",
          "I don't know a ton about Brazilian futbol, but I did get to see Flamengo play Cruzeira. I didn't care much about the game- I went to experience the crowd. Honesty requires mentioning that this is not the nicest part of Rio. But the large number of security guards carrying",
          "The stadium is very comfortable and beautiful. Specially when on Flamengo\u2019s games, it\u2019s a red and black show. The Flamengo\u2019s funs sing all time and we have an amazing party. Go to Maracan\u00e3 in Flamengo\u2019s games. It\u2019s beautiful.",
          "Last time i went to Maracana is about 15 years ago! Although it has been serverly changed by the upgrading before the Olympics and World Cup it is still regarded as one of THE arenas in the world.",
          "Everything you would expect in a South American Football stadium, noise, colour, drums and lots of passion.",
          "Such a massive disappointment - we were so looking forward to visiting this iconic venue but underwhelms in many ways. Ugly from outside and tired inside - only go if watching a match. Some history detailed but somehow the 7-1 defeat to Germany is missing on all the World Cup",
          "Biggest passion of Brazil is great experienced at Maracan\u00e3, we ve been there for the tour and a match of most popular club of the country, Flamengo! A must!",
          "I stepped in here to watch a game between Botafogo and Vasco de Gama. Unbelievable! The fans alone had so much passion from start to end, so much energy that I cannot compare to a different event to date; everyone was standing, chanting babies and adults, flares in all",
          "Rio is a magical place and this stadium reflects its surroundings. A must visit if you have time, if not, I\u2019d suggest you make time!",
          "Great atmosphere in here. Would really recommend going, very cheap and easy to access. use student discount if you have",
          "Went here and Watched Ramario play his last game and score his last goal for Fluminase. Class to be involved in such a crazy atmosphere.",
          "Went for a game and what a fantastic experience!! They are a passionate bunch and loud :). We got a taxi there, concierge organised our tickets. You get searched when you enter. English is not widely spoken so there is pointing needed at times. You can get beer and food there.",
          "Rated this as poor because the paid experience of going on the guided tour was dreadful. There is literally nothing there! For such an strong identity in the history of Brazilian football, this museum and tour really let it down. We wondered round the dressing room and pitch",
          "Amazing stadium, you can see the dressers, the field, the footprints of many stars like Rivelino, Julio Cesar, Pele. Seniors pay 50% with ID",
          "Too stressful, too many people trying to sell things and quite intimidating. Not an enjoyable experience.",
          "An interesting tour with lots of history. whilst it has been renovated i would have loved to have seen the original stadium. it seems to lack some character",
          "We were too late for the English tour, so did the self-guided tours. Between signs and obvious things (even I can recognize a locker room,) it was well worth the visit, even self-guided. Fun to see some of the historical stuff, and to go out and sit in the seats and view the",
          "Seeing the Maracana from the outside is like visiting a great wall of concrete... not emotion at all. If you can't get in, don't make the effort to get to the place",
          "This arena is vast, magnificent and I can ensure you the sound could be heard all over the city when there were games. The Brazilians sang so loud it was fantastic! They said it can be up to three months waiting time for tickets, being an extremely popular entertainment for",
          "We took a guided tour of the Maracan\u00e3 today. There was just 4 people on the tour and the guide delivered it in English & Portuguese. On the tour we saw some memorabilia, the dressing room, the pitch from the sideline and sat in the stands. We were brought into the press",
          "Brazil\u2019s National religion is football and this is their grand temple. Little bit out of the way. Doesn\u2019t take too long to explore. Student discount available. Most staff only speak Portuguese",
          "Wow wow wow loved it had a full day here amazing experience ever well worth coming and highly recommended for any one at any age",
          "From my point of view this tour is not covering to much about this historical place. Maybe my expectations were to high because I visited more stadiums at world. I guess this mythic place is amazing for soccer lovers but tour could be better.",
          "So I am an American who went to Brazil for my first time. I had the luxury of having a friend who lives in Rio show me around. We went to this stadium to see the Foo Fighters concert. I was a little unsure as I have heard about the violence in Brazil quite often, however I will",
          "Nice to visit the place which saw only in matches on TV.Cool to visit if you are Football Fan.Try to visit if any matches are going on. You may also visit inside after paying the entering fees,",
          "We did a quick tour of the stadium while it was empty and then went to a Copa SudAmerica game couple nights after. It was absolutely spectacular. The Fans are intense! We took a van from our hotel to the stadium, as it was a 9:30pm game and didn't want to be looking for a cab",
          "I volunteered in the Athlete's Village and my work colleague invited me to the closing ceremony. Dunno what it looks like two years on, but it was stunning back in August 2016.",
          "So we paid around 30 USD for 3 entrances, we expected a complete museum with historic exhibitions. What did we get? A whole lot of emptiness, I can describe the entire tour and I guarantee you can be done with it less than 30min when you visit yourself: 1. Start by buying the",
          "This was the highlight of my trip to Rio and you have to catch a game! I saw Flamengo play Vasco De Gama which was a local derby with the most incredible atmosphere I've ever witnessed. I'm a Crystal Palace fan and the atmosphere makes England look very tame! To get tickets just",
          "This was a great experience! Friendly and enthused crowds and the beer was way more reasonably priced than any sporting event in the United States. If you have a team allegiance, make sure you go to the correct ticket window. You\u2019ll know if you\u2019re in the right place by what",
          "maracana can be visited inside by day and not in a game day, there is a permanent exposition on brazilian champions and you can see the areas where it all takes place. may be boring for who doesn't love football.",
          "Had a great evening at the Maracan\u00e3 watching local side Fluminense win 3-1! Comfortable seating which was free to choose despite having tickets with seat numbers, the stewards just said Livre (free) once you have got to your section. The stadium was half full but still had a",
          "This place is indeed the cradle of Brazilian football/soccer. Experiencing it first hand while attending a match there was a once in a lifetime experience. Football is indeed a religion in Brazil and this place has such an important place in their history. Be aware though, it",
          "It\u2019s not expensive to get in but i was underwhelmed by the facility. I think seeing other stadiums first raised our expectations.",
          "The stadium is massive but the tour is not long as per the price,but its good experience to see the stadium,it is near the Maracana metro or you can use the taxi.If you are football fan so u must visit.",
          "For all football lovers I believe this stadium is a must visit. I love football, so for me visiting this stadium it was a great experience. I would recommend it to everybody that likes football.",
          "Our hotel offered us some tickets to go and watch a game at the Maracana and it was an amazing experience. 60,000 Crazy fans watching Flamengo play - unbelievable! The stadium itself is great - good views of the pitch from all around. If you aren't lucky enough to attend a game,",
          "The stadium is huge. It also has a smaller indoor arena adjacent to it where indoor sports are played. We did not take the tour of the inside. From the outside, the stadium looked tired and does not seem to maintain it well, even soccer games are played here regularly with large",
          "Well I've been... and i've stood where the footballing legends have played. Worth every penny... The Maracana Stadium... Wow... its where ideals and dreams are made... John Barnes's goal in 1984.. Any footie fan... this is a must and a nice tribute to Chapecoense with their",
          "Beautifil staduim Keep your belongings safe and out of sight Easy to get to by taxi Lots of stalls outside to by souvenirs Always nigotiate, they can spot a tourist from a mile away",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to the Maracana. Easy to reach on the Metro. Tours were regular and lasted about an hour. Guide spoke in various languages to cater for all visitors. Overall, a great experience and glad to say that I visited one of football's iconic stadiums!",
          "Nice place to visit One of the biggest stadium in the world Easy to find and in a secure place I recommend",
          "My two boys wanted to go on a tour of the stadium, but were were lucky enough to be in Rio at the time of the Cup Final.!! What a fantastic way to experience the Maracana!!!! Easy to reach by the Metro.",
          "I was lucky to see finals there in April between Vosco Vs Botefogo Imagine 64000 spectators in stadium.....",
          "Managed to see a local Rio cup final was an absolutely amazing atmosphere. Went as a couple and booked through the hotel - would definitely recommend this if going to a big match. There were 62,000 people and would have struggled to navigate this on our own and it was crazy! The",
          "It\u2019s ok. Just check it on your list by seeing it from the outside. There is very few things to see inside. These guys should learn from stadiums in Europe!",
          "My husband couldn't wait to visit Maracana. He was sooooo disappointed by the stadium!! They apparently invested alot into this Stadium and renovated it - does not look it one bit. There are basics missing from this stadium such as trophy cabinet. The tour cost us $50 combined,",
          "when out and about you can take a side trip and stop by, its like 50.00 Reais for non guided tour or 60.00 Reais for guided tour",
          "We visited the Maracana stadium while in Rio. There is an entrance fee and it is open from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM when there are no games. The whole visit took about 30 mins. If you are a soccer fan it is a must while in Rio.",
          "There are special tours organised for tourists for this historic stadium and if you are a football fan than this place is a must visit place in Rio de Janeiro! We watched a local match and the atmosphere was absolutely awesome! The pick up and drop off from the hotel is",
          "It was nice to see where all the soccer magic that has mead Brazil the best happens. I am sure if we had enough time we would have enjoyed the inside tour if its available.",
          "The most hirtorical football site of the world! The tour is adequate but nothing special. The spirit of the place captures you.",
          "Even if you are not a big football fan you might know that this is a famous pitch. However if you're not a worshipper then this shrine to Brazilian superstars is a bit of a waste of time. A dull drab exterior gives no guide to the sporting fireworks that happened within",
          "This place used to be a soccer stadium but today we have more rock shows over there than soccer matches unhappily. All the refurbishnement that they had done over there was very bad because today only allow 70.000 people and in the past this was the biggest soccer stadium of the",
          "We really wanted to watch a game on the legendary Maracana stadium and we did it. The price for the game tickets is the same as for the tour, 50 reais (the guided tour is even more expensive). We bought tickets two days before the match day and on Sunday we had a trouble with",
          "absolute pleasure and a must visit of this famous stadium, a palace of the football greats of the past and especially pele the best of all time",
          "60R for a guided tour. Last 20 minutes including going through displays (non exisitant), the guide talking, stands and dressing rooms. Compared to other football ground tours it was like a small local club had created it. If you are into football save your time and money for",
          "We went to take pictures of the Maracana stadium. While we were there we saw that the stadium tour without a guide was R$50 and with a guide R$65. We would have liked to walk in to have a look inside but thought that was a bit expensive. So we went back to see a game another",
          "I wanted to visit this famous stadium for almost 40 years. Finally , my dream came true. A truly magnificent place. We went to watch a football match between local rivals which add more interest to the visit. Fodd and drink prices inside the stadium were so reasonable",
          "We went to a quiet game on a Sunday night. Great way to see the stadium, hardly anyone there and a good match!",
          "Went to Maracan\u00e3 for PC's show (wonderful, btw). The stadium was remodeled (almost rebuilt, except for its shape) for the World Cup , but it seems like there is no maintenance. Chairs look old. Dirty. Restrooms smell bad. Other than this, the metro is the best way to get",
          "Very interesting visit with good behind the scenes access. Tour guides were very informative and nobody was rushed.",
          "Went to the foo fighters concert. You can go with the metro, it has its own station (Maracan\u00e1). Big entries and walkpaths. When you go inside, it's so big and beautiful , you feel really tiny. Everything well cared of. Sittings in good condition. It ha roof, but only partially,",
          "The tour cost \u00a333 for 2 adults and 1 child and lasted around 20mins. There is very little to see a few Flamengo artifacts fron the 1980\u2019s, nothing Pele or Brazil national team. Even the small souvenir shop didn\u2019t have a Brazil shirt! And the pitch had been torn for a concert",
          "Daily tours are worth in for soccer fans, I think it was $10.00. The gift shop has great stuff. The stadium is easily reached on Metro for $1.50. and 15 minutes ride from downtown or 30 min. ride from beaches.",
          "This is nothing like other high stadiums tours I\u2019ve been on (e.g old Trafford, Wembley, Camp Nou, Bernabeu). There\u2019s no museum, no trophy cabinet, very limited displays, very little history/info on the Brazil national team. Even the press room is a fake small room. You\u2019re",
          "How can anyone miss a football match in Maracana is beyond me. Definitely a must to watch a soccer match in Maracana. Be exhilarated by the crowds and cheers!",
          "Really great activity and a must do in Brazil - try and watch a Flamengo game - incredible passion and atmousphere built from the fans. Beer can be served too you so you don't need to keep going in and out. Annoyingly a lot fans stand in the open spaces which men's you may need",
          "Maracan\u00e3 was, of course, the big futbol (soccer in the US) stadium for many famous games. It hosted some of the Olympics and the 2014 World Cup games. You can go see it but I am not sure why unless you want to see a stadium that is no longer in use. I don't think it is worth",
          "Maracana stadium looking goof after renovation, went for a local game and the access was easy and organized. There is a lot history in this place.",
          "The only thing that was nice is to see the famous Maracan\u00e3. But is really expensive for what gave to you. About history is just a little thing, I prefer the CBF museum that really tell about the futebol history. In Maracan\u00e3 you just see how big it is the dressing room, better go",
          "2014 World Cup! Great panoramic photo shoot Football history Stone engraved art Friendly people all around",
          "One of the biggest experience of my life but only because I have personaly met a legendary ZICO other than that stadium like others... price very high 60 real and to be honest I thought it will be bigger than that but we live in 21 century and stadiums dont take breaths away as",
          "If your a football fan and fancy watching a local team i would highly advise doing this in Rio. The tickets are easy to get hold of and cheap enough. The stadium is huge and spacious. It has a great atmosphere!",
          "Had to go and see where the Brazil 2014 Soccer World Cup was held. Great tourist attraction. As Brazil is a soccer nation it was great to see where it all happens",
          "We were there on a day of a Football match, so the stadium was not open for guided tours, so we only saw it from the outside, which of course is not the same as inside.",
          "Worth a visit as you can feel how this city lives for their football. The stadium is huge. Its great to be able to see for yourself what you have visualized with television or on social media.",
          "I am not a big football fan, but that didn\u2019t stop me appreciating the magnificence of this stadium. Our tour guide told us of the history of the stadium, showed us through the facilities and of course took us out to field as well. He was interested in many sports and was able to",
          "Brazilian football place to be. Historical building was renewed and now allows only 65.000 people in. Nice experience from a country that used to be the favorite for every world cup.",
          "An absolute temple for football fans. Beautiful stadium with a lot of history. You can enter the pitch, lockerooms and the insides of this giant stadium.",
          "Not the greatest of tours, very small actually, not much to see trophy wise, lovely stadium though. and some nice memrobillia.",
          "Maracana is accessible via metro but it is located away from most of the touristy spots in Rio. It would cost R$60 per person for an entrance ticket and guided tour. Though the visit was informative, I would have given it a miss. The exterior of the stadium is not",
          "We wanted to see a local game between two of the Rio local teams and so we asked our hotel where to buy tickets. They advised about doing it locally in the area of the team playing as being the most effective way of buying and to do this we took a local bus to the area in",
          "Have seen many games at the Maracana and whilst it is a must visit to any football fan and worthwhile even to those who are not particularly fussed about the game itself, I have to say that, apart from the fans, it is pretty similar experience to any large stadium in Europe.",
          "Just an amazing local experience, i found a local guide and you should too to take you, but oh my, what an amazing, super fun, local cultural experience. I am so glad a did this and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone - if you like soccer/football or not. Super friendly and",
          "The tour and the guide was excellent as he spoke in Spanish, Portuguese and English and made sure everyone was okay. Starting off in the reception area/small museum, then into the changing rooms, to pitchside and finishing off in the small press room.You get to sit in the",
          "We took a very enjoyable tour around the small museum, into the changing rooms and the press conference rooms, and best of all through the tunnel to the edge of the pitch, and to sit in the dugouts. The tour takes maybe around an hour and takes about 45 minutes by car or taxi",
          "If you want to see what happens to magnificence if you just don't care a damn. It's closed for good, seats have been torn out, equipment got stolen and the electricity has been shut off due to unpaid bills. The green has turned into a brown and stinky swamp. Guides tours have",
          "Worth a quick call to see home of Brazil football. Unfortunately we only visited the outside so didn't see the details but a true footy fan has got to see it. Apparently the capacity has been cut to just under 80,000 so no longer crowds of 200,000 Brazilians to talk of. It's a",
          "For any football fan, Maracan\u00e3 is THE stadium to visit. I would definitely advise trying to go to a game if you can. We bought our tickets from the box office at the stadium an hour before kick-off - only 40 real per ticket for the premium seats, or 30 to sit with the hardcore",
          "Part of our group tour, and wouldn't be my first choice, but then I'm not a big football fan. You get to walk around the dressing rooms, and go pitch side (not on the grass though). Struck me that the pitch could use some investment, but the stadium looks top grade.",
          "If you like Football you have to visit the most famous stadium of Brazil. Reforbushid for the world cup the new Maracana is a brand new stadium with new chairs. The only stadium of the world that gets two world cup finals. \u00cd recommend.",
          "The iconic Maracana soccer stadium. I was surprise to find out that the stadium its not called the Maracana. Its called Mario Filho. There is no even a sign that refers to the Maracana but a must visit if you are a soccer or futbol fan. I just wish they had a game when i was",
          "Good to see a big match of soccer like flaxflu or flaxvasco. Take care. Go by car or taxi or subway or train, but go with local people (Flu supporters are very kind), cause there are some bad people who wants to fight. If you want to be safety on a calm day, go on fluxsport or",
          "We tried to go to a game at the Maracana. What a disappointment. I accept we didn't do our homework beforehand, but how complicated can getting tickets to a game be? A lot. We arrived 45 minutes before game time. The lines were two blocks long, and didn't move. No one spoke",
          "This stadium has many history, and I think is the biggest in the globe. The ticket costs 50 reales, not sure if this is a good price. In my opinion it ain't worth.",
          "At the beginning, I wanted to visit the stadium. But it wasn't a pity that there was the game Fluminense vs Vasco da Gama! The ticket is 40 R$, 20 R$ for students. It is amazing how Brazilians feel soccer games! It's worth - doing, for sure.",
          "The whole place has been left to go to rack and ruin since the Olympic Games last year. The battle between the central and local government to see who to looks after it has gone on too long",
          "I did the stadium tour one day which was good!! Then I was lucky enough to get a ticket for the Brazilian 1st leg cup final!!! The atmosphere outside was fantastic but one inside it was ten times better. Non stop singing, drums playing and when they scored the place erupted",
          "But try to watch a match there not just tour the facility it is a huge nice building but would attract most a football fan.",
          "one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world (and I was in a lot !!) Brasil is the football country , if you are in brasil you must to go there ! I love it big time ! obrigado brasil ! vamos Neymar !",
          "The highlight is the tour guide person, was so kind, knowledgeable, amazing way to handle several people at the same time, I think the story of soccer that was played here deserves a little bit more, like a museum with information on events held here.",
          "Check opening times as it just reopened in June after it was left abandoned since the World Cup. There are tours in Spanish but you can also wonder around on your own. This is where Uruguay beat Brazil to win World Cup 1950 and Germany beat Argentina 2014.",
          "Maracan\u00e3 is the most famous soccer stadium, in fact it is the most famous Football Stadium. Be careful, the restaurants inside do not accept credit and debit cards, just money. A temple that must be seen for those who love the sport.",
          "Went here to watch the Fluminense v Corinthians game. My hostel had a guide that took us, and the price (around R$ 70) covered tickets, transportation, and a guide. I heard that's common for other guides. It's a huge stadium and the crowd was crazy. I visited with some Germans,",
          "The stadium in great and the spectacle during a Football match is even better! Don't miss any of them.",
          "I can warmly recommend watching a soccer game at this iconic stadium, still one of the largest in the world.",
          "While we didn't get to see the inside of the facilities, it was included on our private tour of Rio. The complex includes a main football (soccer) stadium, opened in 1950 that seats 78,838 people, an arena and swimming pools. Besides holding FIFA events and concerts, it also",
          "Very nicely prepared to host the Olympics, with lots of memorabilia allowing you to enter the stadium including the warming up field.",
          "I was fortunate enough to go see a football match (Fuminense) and also do a tour of the stadium during my stay in Rio. It was great to see a match at such an iconic stadium in world football. The tour was good for seeing the stadium 'behold the scenes' but there could be a lot",
          "If you want to go for a short (40mns) tour of the impressive and famous stadium, just get there on the day and buy the ticket! As the stadium is in the northern part of the city on the way to the airport, we just stopped by on our last day before heading back home!",
          "We just went to the Maracana with our taxi driver without any special tour organization. His name was Aloysio Filho and I would definitively recommend him. He was speaking English and he was very knowledgeable about his city and proud to show it to us. We paid him around 22$ per",
          "This is a great place in Rio to visit during your stay in the city. In special if you are going to watch any Brazilian team palying against each other. It\u00b4s full of people and also very safety to be there. The price it\u00b4s not expensive and the emotion is increadiable. For sure",
          "Despite its history, it's not that big deal on premises and services. But it's in Rio and a soccer match between local teams is somehow different cause of their vibes.",
          "The stadium itself is really impressive after its major renovation and getting tickets for football matches there is easy and cheap, we had the reception at our hotel help us buy them. We went for a match in the Brazilian cup tournament between Fluminense and Gremio and despite",
          "1 of the most iconic and famous football stadiums in the world. I was absolutely determined to see a game while in Rio and I got lucky as they held the first game since the 2016 Olympics Flamengo vs San Lorenzo in Copa Libertadores. Unfortunately like a lot of Olympic stadiums",

          "My tour could not visit this stadium because there was a futball game that day, which was a shame. I took the subway to get a view from the station, and from the outside it is a very impressive structure. The only reason I don't give it a full 5 starts is that I was not able",
          "They have an exhibition where you can see that football is inside the heart of every single Brazilian. After that you can visit the dress rooms, conference, press and the seats were the players are at the field. I got really lucky, the police officer played crazy and I could",

          "We visited the stadium on the afternoon part of a full day city tour with Viator. Maracana is one of the most famous soccer stadiums in the entire world so it is worth seeing for that reason alone. Many people take photos/selfies at the Bellini statue.",
          "For football lovers and not only. The stadium can be visited if no game in that day. Prices on the fan shop are too high",
          "I have visited the Maracana many times during visits to Rio as well as when I lived in Rio in the 1970's. The place is a monument to football. Though it was renovated for the World Cup and Olympics, it still holds the mystical sense that history brings. It's incredible to see",
          "The Maracana is amazing, a beatiful modern stadium, yet laced with history. I was lucky enough to see it on my first visit to Rio in 2008 so I saw it as it 'was' before a lovely modernisation for the World Cup in 2014. This time it was nice to see how the old girl has scrubbed",

          "Wanted to visit this impressive stadium, the home famous of famous Rio football teams and the 2016 Olympics. We were fortunate that there was a match on - a South America Cup match between the local legendary Fluminese team and Liverpool from Uruguay. We caught an uber there",

          "I went there for the Paralympics opening. Even living in Brazil, I never had a chance to go to Maracan\u00e3. I found this the perfect opportunity. First impression was oh my god it's so huge! Are so many gates and the entrances, that if you don't park your car in the right side",
          "We visited the stadium from outside . Took quite a few photos . The stadium is awe . We cannot go inside the stadium as there are no tours particularly for that . Never the less it is a good place to see",

          "Just a large stadium and everything is overpriced. Better to book our online. Don't hang around the motorway too long!",
          "It's good for a photo stop to take a few pictures, even if you don't do the stadium tour. Worth a short visit for 20 minutes and it is included on many city tours.",

          "Enjoyed a tour around the stadium finishing with a walk into the arena. Lots of photo opportunities.",
          "Visited as part of a tour. Wonderful to see the stadium in the flesh. Memories of John Barnes' wonder goal not to mention the Rio Games and Paragames. Goosebumps moment and one to treasure and say \"I was there\".",

          "It's a must if you like footie. It's a religion in Brazil. The rumour is Christ the Redeemer points to the two most important things for Brazilians - the beaches and the Maracana. Great to see scale and pay homage. If you don't like football then not worth the trip",
          "Unfortunately, the stadium was closed to visitors when we arrived but even from the outside it's worth seeing such an iconic Stadium. This is even more relevant if you are a football fan. It would have been better to enter the Stadium but just being outside at the ticket office",
          "A favorite sporting event is going to the Rio Maracana Stadium for a soccer match. Very Exciting!!! \u26bd\ufe0f\u26bd\ufe0f Lots of cheering/chanting/screaming/ confetti/dancing/music/the Wave & fireworks. We like the inexpensive Cement Grandstands so we can interact with the fanatic Local",
          "it was exciting to visit this stadium, although we were only able to see it outside since at the moment it is closed to the public to access, so make sure you find out with the hotel before you go, unless you dont mind just going outside",
          "We have bee before the world cup and after. Unfortunatelly they threw out all parts of the beautifull and emotional history of the stadium and the teams that played here the most. After the world cup it all changed to a boring FIFA guided museum showing some stories of the",

          "As almost everybody knows soccer is a religion for Brazilians. Consider Maracan\u00e3 (\"Maraca\") to be the most importante temple. Whether in a tour or in a match, the Maraca is a must see for a Rio visitor. P.S.: it is not the same after the reforms for the World Cup, but it is",
          "Went there on the 2/01/17 only to find the whole stadium closed.The website stated that the tours ran every hour. We took a taxi there , the vendor outside told us the tours had not ran since the Olympics. Is it too much to ask for one of the clowns there to change the info on",
          "For football fans it's a must do. The football season had ended but We got a chance to watch a charity match with 60,000. The atmosphere was great. Brazil Expeditions arranged it all.",

          "One of the largest stadiums in Brazil. It is an unforgettable experience to watch a soccer match between local Rio teams, called \"classico\". (Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Botafogo, Fluminense)",
          "We spent about 10 mins here on a city tour. I'm not into football and was unimpressed. If you are a fan be aware, they don't do tours inside and you can't get in the stadium.",
          "My wife and I visited for the yearly charity game hosted by Zico. First off, the stadium is really very impressive. I'm a bigger fan of stadiums that are tiered, but being able to see every single of >70k fans (like in the Maracan\u00e3) is quite an experience. That's where the good",
          "I have come to Brazil several times and it is never available. Has a website that does not work and does not specify that it is closed",

          "This is review of the Stadium where the Olympic and Paralympic cerimonies took place. It was outstanding for this purpose as well and great to be there. Good public transportation (Metro) and excellent structure for shows. I wish I could have been there for the men final",
          "Not a review of the stadium so much, but the official Maracana Stadium website says that the tour is on every hour, 5 days a week. We arrived at the stadium looking for the entrance only to be told that the tour has not been available since the Olympics finished due to 'economic",
          "This is an iconic stadium and a must see for all football fans. We saw Flamengo play Santos on 27/11/16. The atmosphere is electric, the Flamengo fans are in a league of their own and thankfully they won 2-0. The outside facade has been kept as original but the interior has been",
          "Went to watch Fluminense play and the Stadium was about 1/3 full but man can the Brazilian Fans put on a show! Felt like the Stadium was full. Definitely try and plan your trip around a high profile game at the Maracana.",
          "I will give you an American's point of view as I have been to very large sporting events around the US and the world. As a big soccer fan this was a great experience, but not as crazy as I would have liked. We saw Flamengo v Santos play and it was a battle of two teams ranked",
          "I went there bcs my boyfriend wanted to visit the place. According to the website they would have visits in the place everyday... what was our surprise to arrive there and verify that they were no doing visits anymore...",
          "Stunning stadium - even after the refurbishments you can still feel the history. We went to see Fluminense play here - the prices were very good (20 reals each). Fluminense and Botafogo play most of their home games here. Walking to the stadium felt safe. Police were visible",
          "Went here for the Flamengo - Botafogo match and was a bit disappointed. Couple of chants yeah but the fans that claim that they\u00b4re the most passionate when it comes to Football were actual quite poor when it came to chanting for their team. If you want to really witness passion",

          "An all renewed stadium, is something special. Huge, able to accomodate almost 80 thousand people, was initially built in 1950. It is a wonderful ocasion when there is a busy soccer game. The best way to get there is by bus or subway, once it is hard to park around there.",

          "Climbing down from the corcovado, just a little detour and you'll discover a lovely (free) place with a very nice view. It's worth it.",
          "This is a faily accessible hill within the city boundaries with a great view and is a good destination for a weekend.",
          "We took an early tour of Christ the Redeemer and we arrived early, so as a bonus the tour guide took us to Mirante Dona Marta and WOW were the views spectacular! It has a lot of the same views as the top of Corcovado, but some I thought were even better!",
          "For photographers: This is your postcard view of Rio. It has the classic view of the bays surrounding Sugarloaf. I was here very early in the morning, just before sunrise. Carpark is very dark as well as the 5 minute walk out to the viewpoint. Be a little cautious at this time",
          "My tour guide took me to this area and now I know where. You can see a scenic view of the city, Christ the Redeemer as well as Sugar loft. If you look down, you can see the villas where Michael Jackson filmed one of his videos and I also learned the Fast and the Furious was",
          "Fantastic views from the top! Bit of a bumpy ride up but worth it. Very quiet when you get up there hardly any tourists. I would recommend getting a uber or taxi and getting them to wait whilst you're talking photos. Pass through a lot of favela on the way, would be cautious",
          "This place can be an alternative to see the Christ from. There are many nica viatas all around. We took many nice photos with the Christ on the background. As line up for the team was ridiculous we decided to stop by there instead. In any case The Christ was our MUST so we did",
          "You can go walking from the Paineiras Visitors Centre until the D. Marta Balvedere, and there your are going to find one of the most amazing views from the Christ Statue.",
          "We went walking with few friends, we crossed a colourful favella and we felt in the real Brazil, the walk is around 50min to the basement. I completely recommend!",
          "Good spot to see Christ the Redeemer from afar, as well as the city below. If you've already been up to the statue, it might be a slight repeat..but if you are into a nice viewpoint, why not.",
          "A nice ride with the car and than some walk on foot brings you to wonderful views of rio and niteroi. The relentless parking attendant will charge you 3 reals for parking which is next to nothing in comparison to the overall expensive Rio.",
          "a great location with an incredible view over this amazing city. Would highly recommend a quick trip here - tends to be less crowded the other sites on busy days.",
          "A place from which you can see the whole city and Cristo as well, try to go during the sunny day and view is fantastic. You can go there with taxi or uber, bus and then walk or walk from Cosme Vehlo but in that case try to avoid favela that's by the way and take just a little",
          "This place is the spot to see the Guanabara bay, closer and more unobstructed to it. It is located in the middle of the road that leads to \u2018Corcovado\u2019, so, if you are by car, the visit is mandatory, but you can also go by vans, just ask the driver if the tour passes through this",
          "Amazing view of the city, and also a very beautiful view of Christ the Redeemer! Definitely worth the stop if visiting the statue of Christ.",
          "This is a magic place, where you are not very high as Corcovado or Sugar Loaf, but you have a wonderful view of the Botafogo neihgbourhood and the best view of the Sugar Loaf, just in front of you. Its very easy to go there, not far away and you won't spend too much time.",
          "This is the only place in town where you can get great views of BOTH Sugar Loaf/Urca and Corcovado/Christ statue. It is worth the drive.",
          "A beautiful view of the Rio scenery similar to the one from the Christ but lower but just as beautiful if not more because you are closer and without the crowds",
          "It was an amazing day. We climbed up from Parque Lage to Cristo Redentor and walked back via the road for cars. We arrived at Mirante Dona Marta (if you take the car for a tour than they stop also at this point and you can also go by own car. Than you pay 2 real to park) and we",
          "As a Carioca, I had never been there before, and I really don't know why. Is not as famous as corcovado or the sugar loaf, but I can ensure that is the best view ever. From there, you can see Baia de Guanabara, the Sugar Loaf and Corcovado. Try to go in a beautiful day, so you",
          "this has wonderful views of teh Christ of redeemer on the right, the sugar loaf on the left and the beach front. Worth taking Uber taxi to get there as even they cost around R$30 from the city centre. Normal taxi would cost twice as much.",
          "This is a relaxed place to enjoy nice views of the city. It's lower than Christ Redeemer so you get to see more detail of your surroundings but can't see as far. It's best on a clear day, we went in the afternoon and it was very sunny (there weren't many places with shade). Take",
          "One of the best views of Rio overlooking the Sugar Loaf and Botofago bay. Worth coming up at sunrise or sunset.",
          "Wonderful views - not so crowded as at Cristo de Redentor. Easy to park also. very relaxing with views of the whole city without the crowds",
          "One of the best views to be had in Rio. You can see Cristo Redentor, favelas, Sugar Loaf, just about everything.",
          "The view from here is just breathtaking.. come up here when is a sunny day and you will be amazed.. you can see the crist, favela from the top, sugarloaf and the city..",

          "Getting at Mirante Dona Marta you will have the opportunity to make the best photos of your trip to Rio de Janeiro. It's part of the Tijuca National Park and has security office at the entrance. From there is available the Helicopter Sight if you want something more top",
          "l never tried helicuptor tour before but when l go to rio l tried this company it was great so l really love view of rio with helicuptor tour you must take a tour so you will definetly love it and pilot is very friendly and very helpful and plus was great price so you should do",
          "We have been to Rio about three times already and in all occasions we visited Christ Redeemer. One of the things I enjoy doing on our visit to the statue is viewing the city, sugar loaf mountain and Christ Redeemer from the viewpoint, it is absolutely amazing and I don't think",
          "I've visited this place many times. It\u00b4s a calm place, has a nice view and is free. The only problem, there is no public transport to arrive there. You will need pick up taxi or rent a car. The access is fast, just 20min by car from south zone.",
          "Views towards Sugarloaf, Christ the Redeemer, the lagoon and more! There is a heliport there, too, which usually is less crowded with long lines than the ones alongside the lagoon or at Sugarloaf...",
          "We were unlucky to visit Christ Redeemer on a foggy day, so could barely see even legs of the statue, not even speaking about the city itself. Therefore our guide arranged a stop at Mirante Dona Marta, which was less affected by cloudiness and we could enjoy city views.",
          "We've were fortunate to go to this beautiful place. The view is amazing. The nature is incredible! The air is different. Everything is so peacfull and beautiful up here. You can almost touc the sky. This was one of my favourite things in Rio. Forget every other view point this",
          "This is a point of interest that allows the visitor to see unsurpassed views of the city. As I remember, there no services here.",
          "Fantastic views with less of a crowd than you usually get at Corcovado. The only issue is you must have a car to get here as it is a long way from public transport",
          "Is a nice place to see the view, but \"zero\" security \" o if you need / must/ desire, go with Hotels or Travell Agencies Securities",
          "Got here with one of the private shuttles that take you to the Christ The Redeemer. What a great place to visit as there aren't too many people and you get a wonderful views of the city and Christ The Redeemer. Just make sure you go on a clear sunny day, otherwise it will be",
          "A photographer friend recommended this view point of Rio to the far more crowded Christ Redeemer statue and I was not disappointed. Would be fantastic at sunset too though I would recommend your own transportation to get here.",
          "One of the most beautiful views in the world. Its'd hard to get there without a car, if you have some energy you can go bikinh admire the landscape of the Whole Rio de Janeiro. Sugar loaf, Cristo, Maracana, Niteroi Bridge, Slums, beaches, airports are among other things you'll",
          "Take a taxi or a Bus on the way up or down to Christ the redeemer and stop here. Best views of the city and jesus.",
          "One of the pros of not taking the train to the Corcovado its the chance of visiting this place. Usually, this mirador its a mandatory stop for the buses that would take you up for a fix fee or if you choose to take a taxi, you might stop here for a minute or two. The area has 2",
          "I did not expect such a view having turned down opportunity to go to the Christos and the Sugar Loaf from lack of time and too much bother with crowds, I was driven by a friend to this spot. Excellent choice. Grear views over the bay",
          "This is the most beautiful viewpoint of Rio. From there you have an amazing view to sugar loaf and Corcovado and also Lagoon, copacabana beach, ipanema, guanabara bay, Maracan\u00e3, niteroi. If you don't have much time to spend in Rio, and have to choose between sugar loaf of",
          "It may be a little challenging to get there but the trip is worth the drive. I was able to drive there using a mapping software on my phone easily enough but be prepared for some challenging driving on roads that used to be the rail tracks for the Santa Teresa trolleys. When you",
          "What a great spot! Not sure the best things to advert this spot as the best was that there were not too many people there :)",

          "Our guide took us here on way back from the pandemonium of crowds waiting to get onto mini buses to get to Corcovado which is now a problem since cars cannot be driven to the top. This site has free access and not only gives magnificent view of Christ the Redeemer but turn",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro (MAM) (Portuguese: Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro) is a museum located in northeastern Flamengo Park, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is in the Centro district, west of Santos Dumont Airport, on Guanabara Bay.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nFlamengo Park was an urban planning project on the coast of Rio under the direction of Roberto Burle Marx (1909-1994) in the 1950s and 1960s.  The Modernist concrete museum building, designed by Affonso Eduardo Reidy (1909-1964), was completed in 1955. The museum's landmark Modernist gardens were designed by Burle Marx.The main building has a dramatic cadence of external pillar elements, connected by longitudinal beams, providing a galley level free of internal columns or structural walls. The park was created on landfill in the bay, so the pillars footings reach 20 metres (66 ft) down.A large outdoor terrace is framed by the entrance fa\u00e7ades of the main building and theater wing. The northern fa\u00e7ade has aluminum shutters to control the amount of (low) natural light entering the gallery space during the winter solstice period. The windows of the gallery are oriented to the north and south.An inner courtyard was also designed by Burle Marx. A broad spiral ramp element reaches an upper level, with a roof terrace, restaurant, bar, and lounge overlooking Guanabara Bay, Sugarloaf, and Rio's other granitic mountain formations.\n\n\n== Scope ==\nAffonso Eduardo Reidy's essay for the meaning of the museum expressed: \n\"The cultural influence of a modern art museum is not only drawn from the collection of works of art and of courses of study and conferences held there, but more particularly the creation of their own intellectual atmosphere in which the artist is to enrich their own work and ideas in which the public can absorb the artistic culture required by the mind of modern man. \"The museum's scope is as an arts center, and includes:\nexhibitions \u2014 galleries for the permanent collection and travelling shows.\nschool of art \u2014 with lecture and studio spaces.\ntheater \u2014 for concerts, plays, classical ballets, film exhibitions, and conferences.\noperations \u2014 public services (dining, etc.), workshops, collections warehouses, and administration offices.\n\n\n== 1978 fire ==\nOn July 8, 1978, a rough fire caused by a cigarette or due an electrical failure, destroyed 90% of the artworks \u2013 including artworks from Pablo Picasso (\"Cubist Head\" and \"Portrait of Dora Maar\"), Mir\u00f3 (\"Persons in a Landscape\"), Salvador Dal\u00ed (\"Egg on a Plate, Without the Plate\"), Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Diego Rivera, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Ivan Serpa, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Manabu Mabe and others \u2013 and all artworks showed in a big retrospective of artist Joaquin Torres Garc\u00eda.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMinistry of Education and Health Building (Gustavo Capanema Palace), Rio de Janeiro \u2014 Affonso Eduardo Reidy part of architectural team.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Portuguese)\u2013Museos do Rio: Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro - MAM-Rio \u2014 Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro- MAM-Rio).",

        "wiki": "Rio de Janeiro (; Portuguese: [\u02c8\u0281i.u d(\u0292i) \u0292\u0250\u02c8ne(j)\u027eu] (listen);), or simply Rio, is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area and the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state, after S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\", by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Bras\u00edlia.\nRio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th largest in the world in 2008, estimated at about R$343 billion (nearly US$201 billion). It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations \u2013 Petrobras and Vale \u2013 and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data. Despite the high perception of crime, the city actually has a lower incidence of crime than most state capitals in Brazil. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the Samb\u00f3dromo (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums. Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to ever host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. The Maracan\u00e3 Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\nEuropeans first encountered Guanabara Bay on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, \"January River\"), by a Portuguese expedition under explorer Gaspar de Lemos, captain of a ship in Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's fleet, or under Gon\u00e7alo Coelho. Allegedly the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci participated as observer at the invitation of King Manuel I in the same\nexpedition. The region of Rio was inhabited by the Tupi, Puri, Botocudo and Maxakal\u00ed peoples.In 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called Villegagnon Island, was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. Consequently, Villegagnon built Fort Coligny on the island when attempting to establish the France Antarctique colony.\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded by the Portuguese on 1 March 1565 and was named S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o do Rio de Janeiro, in honour of St. Sebastian, the saint who was the namesake and patron of the Portuguese then-monarch Sebasti\u00e3o. Rio de Janeiro was the name of Guanabara Bay. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and buccaneers, such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Duclerc and Ren\u00e9 Duguay-Trouin.In the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the Bandeirantes discovered gold and diamonds in the neighbouring captaincy of Minas Gerais, thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than Salvador, Bahia, much farther northeast. On 27 January 1763, the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated Lisbon nobles, fleeing from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Portuguese court and imperial capital ===\nThe kingdom's capital was transferred to the city, which, thus, became the only European capital outside of Europe. As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes. In the first decade, several educational establishments were created, such as the Military Academy, the Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the National Library of Brazil \u2013 with the largest collection in Latin America \u2013 and The Botanical Garden. The first printed newspaper in Brazil, the Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, came into circulation during this period. When Brazil was elevated to Kingdom in 1815, it became the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves until the return of the Portuguese Royal Family to Lisbon in 1821, but remained as capital of the Kingdom of Brazil.From the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of African slaves to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people. The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.When Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his new empire while the place was enriched with sugar cane agriculture in the Campos region and, especially, with the new coffee cultivation in the Para\u00edba Valley. In order to separate the province from the capital of the Empire, the city was converted, in the year of 1834, in Neutral Municipality, passing the province of Rio de Janeiro to have Niter\u00f3i as capital.\n\nAs a political centre of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century. At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing. Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was replaced by a republic.\nOn 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, with the name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a complex with varying architectural styles like Italianate, Neo-Gothic and a tower in Mansard Roof style. After the opening in 1893, workers from Great Britain arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared. In May 1894, Thomas Donohoe, a British worker from Busby, Scotland, arrived in Bangu.Donohoe was horrified to discover that there was absolutely no knowledge of football among Brazilians. So he wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to bring a football when she joined him. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. It was a five-a-side match between British workers, and took place six months before the first game organized by Charles Miller in S\u00e3o Paulo. However, the Bangu Football Club was not formally created until 1904.\n\n\n=== Republican period ===\n\nAt the time Brazil's Old Republic was established, the city lacked urban planning and sanitation, which helped spread several diseases, such as yellow fever, dysentery, variola, tuberculosis and even black death. Pereira Passos, who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the corti\u00e7os where most of the poor population lived. These people, mostly descendants of slaves, then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first favelas. Inspired by the city of Paris, Passos built the Municipal Theatre, the National Museum of Fine Arts and the National Library in the city's center; brought electric power to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to automobiles. Passos also named Dr. Oswaldo Cruz as Director General of Public Health. Cruz's plans to clean the city of diseases included compulsory vaccination of the entire population and forced entry into houses to kill mosquitos and rats. The people of city rebelled against Cruz's policy, in what would be known as the Vaccine Revolt.In 1910, Rio saw the Revolt of the Lash, where Afro-Brazilian crew members in the Brazilian Navy mutinied against the heavy use of corporal punishment, which was similar to the punishment slaves received. The mutineers took control of the battleship Minas Geraes and threatened to fire on the city. Another military revolt occurred in 1922, the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt, a march against the Old Republic's coronelism and caf\u00e9 com leite politics. This revolt marked the beginning of Tenentism, a movement that resulted in the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that started the Vargas Era.\nUntil the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighbourhood now known as the historic city centre (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighbourhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905. Botafogo's natural environment, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, the luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town. This reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade and militias.Plans for moving the nation's capital city from Rio de Janeiro to the centre of Brazil had been occasionally discussed, and when Juscelino Kubitschek was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital. Though many thought that it was just campaign rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have Bras\u00edlia and a new Federal District built, at great cost, by 1960. On 21 April of that year the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Bras\u00edlia. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, Guanabara, after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat that installed a military dictatorship, the city-state was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. Then, in 1975, a presidential decree known as \"The Fusion\" removed the city's federative status and merged it with the State of Rio de Janeiro, with the city of Rio de Janeiro replacing Niter\u00f3i as the state's capital, and establishing the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region.In 1992, Rio hosted the Earth Summit, a United Nations conference to fight environmental degradation. Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on sustainable development, named United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The city hosted the World Youth Day in 2013, the second World Youth Day in South America and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2007 Pan American Games and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final. On 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee announced that Rio de Janeiro would host the 2016 Olympic Games and the 2016 Paralympic Games, beating competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and Madrid. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after Mexico City in 1968) to host the Games.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nRio de Janeiro is on the far western part of a strip of Brazil's Atlantic coast (between a strait east to Ilha Grande, on the Costa Verde, and the Cabo Frio), close to the Tropic of Capricorn, where the shoreline is oriented east\u2013west. Facing largely south, the city was founded on an inlet of this stretch of the coast, Guanabara Bay (Ba\u00eda de Guanabara), and its entrance is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar) \u2013 a \"calling card\" of the city.The Centre (Centro), the core of Rio, lies on the plains of the western shore of Guanabara Bay. The greater portion of the city, commonly referred to as the North Zone (Zona Norte, Rio de Janeiro), extends to the northwest on plains composed of marine and continental sediments and on hills and several rocky mountains. The South Zone (Zona Sul) of the city, reaching the beaches fringing the open sea, is cut off from the Centre and from the North Zone by coastal mountains. These mountains and hills are offshoots of the Serra do Mar to the northwest, the ancient gneiss-granite mountain chain that forms the southern slopes of the Brazilian Highlands. The large West Zone (Zona Oeste), long cut off by the mountainous terrain, had been made more easily accessible to those on the South Zone by new roads and tunnels by the end of the 20th century.The population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of 1,182.3 square kilometres (456.5 sq mi), is about 6,000,000. The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11\u201313.5 million. Residents of the city are known as cariocas. The official song of Rio is \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", by composer Andr\u00e9 Filho.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National Park, the world's first urban forest and UNESCO Environmental Heritage and Biosphere Reserve; Pedra Branca State Park, which houses the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the Quinta da Boa Vista complex; the Botanical Garden; Rio's Zoo; Parque Lage; and the Passeio P\u00fablico, the first public park in the Americas. In addition the Flamengo Park is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much vegetation.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nDue to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region, the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The Guanabara Bay has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the World Health Organization, in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.The waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29 million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers. With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high concentrations of heavy metals \u2013 mainly zinc and cadmium \u2013 have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of Santa Cruz, Itagua\u00ed and Nova Igua\u00e7u, constructed under the supervision of State policies.The Marapendi lagoon and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon have suffered with the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment buildings close by. The illegal discharge of sewage and the consequent deaths of algae diminished the oxygenation of the waters, causing fish mortality.There are, on the other hand, signs of decontamination in the lagoon made through a public-private partnership established in 2008 to ensure that the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing. The decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nRio has a tropical savanna climate (Aw) that closely borders a tropical monsoon climate (Am) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between December and March. The city experiences hot, humid summers, and warm, sunny winters. In inland areas of the city, temperatures above 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) can occur on a monthly basis.\nAlong the coast, the breeze, blowing onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from Antarctica, especially during autumn and winter, causing frequent weather changes. In summer there can be strong rains, which have, on some occasions, provoked catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic. The city has had rare frosts in the past. Some areas within Rio de Janeiro state occasionally have falls of snow grains and ice pellets (popularly called granizo) and hail. Drought is very rare, albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city's strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014\u20132015, most severe in the Southeast Region and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the Para\u00edba do Sul River to the Guandu River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Para\u00edba do Sul to the Sistema Cantareira (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken Greater S\u00e3o Paulo area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.Roughly in the same suburbs (Nova Igua\u00e7u and surrounding areas, including parts of Campo Grande and Bangu) that correspond to the location of the March 2012, February\u2013March 2013 and January 2015 pseudo-hail (granizo) falls, there was a tornado-like phenomenon in January 2011, for the first time in the region's recorded history, causing structural damage and long-lasting blackouts, but no fatalities. The World Meteorological Organization has advised that Brazil, especially its southeastern region, must be prepared for increasingly severe weather occurrences in the near future, since events such as the catastrophic January 2011 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides are not an isolated phenomenon. In early May 2013, winds registering above 90 km/h (56 mph) caused blackouts in 15 neighborhoods of the city and three surrounding municipalities, and killed one person. Rio saw similarly high winds (about 100 km/h (62 mph)) in January 2015. The average annual minimum temperature is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F), the average annual maximum temperature is 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F), and the average annual temperature is 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). The average yearly precipitation is 1,069 mm (42.1 in).\n\nTemperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. During the winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (in the form of winds from the Amazon Forest), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an extratropical cyclone) and summer evapotranspiration bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns. As a result, temperatures over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), that may happen about year-round but are much more common during the summer, often mean the actual temperature feeling is over 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F), when there is little wind and the relative humidity percentage is high.Rio de Janeiro is second only to Cuiab\u00e1 as the hottest Brazilian state capital outside Northern and Northeastern Brazil; temperatures below 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) occur yearly, while those lower than 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) happen less often. The phrase, fazer frio (\"making cold\", i.e. \"the weather is getting cold\"), usually refers to temperatures going below 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F), which is possible year-round and is commonplace in mid-to-late autumn, winter and early spring nights.\nBetween 1961 and 1990, at the INMET (Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology) conventional station in the neighborhood of Sa\u00fade, the lowest temperature recorded was 10.1 \u00b0C (50.2 \u00b0F) in October 1977, and the highest temperature recorded was 39 \u00b0C (102.2 \u00b0F) in December 1963. The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 167.4 mm (6.6 in) in January 1962. However, the absolute minimum temperature ever recorded at the INMET Jacarepagu\u00e1 station was 3.8 \u00b0C (38.8 \u00b0F) in July 1974, while the absolute maximum was 43.2 \u00b0C (110 \u00b0F) on 26 December 2012 in the neighborhood of the Santa Cruz station. The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours, 186.2 mm (7.3 in), was recorded at the Santa Teresa station in April 1967. The lowest temperature ever registered in the 21st century was 8.1 \u00b0C (46.6 \u00b0F) in Vila Militar, July 2011.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\n\nThe city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them Santa Cruz, Campo Grande and the wealthy newer Barra da Tijuca district.\n\n\n=== Central Zone ===\n\nCentro or Downtown is the historic core of the city, as well as its financial centre. Sites of interest include the Pa\u00e7o Imperial, built during colonial times to serve as a residence for the Portuguese governors of Brazil; many historic churches, such as the Candel\u00e1ria Church (the former cathedral), S\u00e3o Jose, Santa Lucia, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Santa Rita, S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula, and the monasteries of Santo Ant\u00f4nio and S\u00e3o Bento. The Centro also houses the modern concrete Rio de Janeiro Cathedral.  Around the Cinel\u00e2ndia square, there are several landmarks of the Belle \u00c9poque of Rio, such as the Municipal Theatre and the National Library building.\nAmong its several museums, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes (National Museum of Fine Arts) and the Museu Hist\u00f3rico Nacional (National Historical Museum) are the most important. Other important historical attractions in central Rio include its Passeio P\u00fablico, an 18th-century public garden. Major streets include Avenida Rio Branco and Avenida Vargas, both constructed, in 1906 and 1942 respectively, by destroying large swaths of the colonial city. A number of colonial streets, such as Rua do Ouvidor and Uruguaiana, have long been pedestrian spaces, and the popular Saara shopping district has been pedestrianized more recently. Also located in the center is the traditional neighbourhood called Lapa, an important bohemian area frequented by both townspeople and tourists.\n\n\n=== South Zone ===\n\nThe South Zone of Rio de Janeiro (Zona Sul) is composed of several districts, among which are S\u00e3o Conrado, Leblon, Ipanema, Arpoador, Copacabana, and Leme, which compose Rio's famous Atlantic beach coastline. Other districts in the South Zone are Gl\u00f3ria, Catete, Flamengo, Botafogo, and Urca, which border Guanabara Bay, and Santa Teresa, Cosme Velho, Laranjeiras, Humait\u00e1, Lagoa, Jardim Bot\u00e2nico, and G\u00e1vea. It is the wealthiest part of the city and the best known overseas; the neighborhoods of Leblon and Ipanema, in particular, have the most expensive real estate in all of South America.\nThe neighbourhood of Copacabana beach hosts one of the world's most spectacular New Year's Eve parties (\"Reveillon\"), as more than two million revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the fireworks display. From 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event.To the north of Leme, and at the entrance to Guanabara Bay, is the district of Urca and the Sugarloaf Mountain ('P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar'), whose name describes the famous mountain rising out of the sea. The summit can be reached via a two-stage cable car trip from Praia Vermelha, with the intermediate stop on Morro da Urca. It offers views of the city second only to Corcovado mountain. Hang gliding is a popular activity on the Pedra Bonita (literally, \"Beautiful Rock\"). After a short flight, gliders land on the Praia do Pepino (Pepino, or \"cucumber\", Beach) in S\u00e3o Conrado.\nSince 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded urban forest and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio (Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro or PUC-Rio), Brazil's top private university, is located at the edge of the forest, in the G\u00e1vea district. The 1984 film Blame It on Rio was filmed nearby, with the rental house used by the story's characters sitting at the edge of the forest on a mountain overlooking the famous beaches. In 2012, CNN elected Ipanema the best city beach in the world.\n\n\n=== North Zone ===\n\nThe North Zone (Zona Norte) begins at Grande Tijuca (the middle class residential and commercial bairro of Tijuca), just west of the city center, and sprawls for miles inland until Baixada Fluminense and the city's Northwest.\nThis region is home to the Maracan\u00e3 stadium (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest capacity football venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as it did for the World Cup final of 1950. More recently its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000; it will eventually hold around 80,000 people. Maracan\u00e3 was the site for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football competition of the 2007 Pan American Games; hosted the final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the football matches of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nBesides Maracan\u00e3, the North Zone of Rio also has other tourist and historical attractions, such \"Nossa Senhora da Penha de Fran\u00e7a Church\", the Christ the Redeemer (statue) with its stairway built into the rock bed, 'Manguinhos', the home of Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, a centenarian biomedical research institution with a main building fashioned like a Moorish palace, and the Quinta da Boa Vista, the park where the historic Imperial Palace is located. Nowadays, the palace hosts the National Museum, specialising in Natural History, Archaeology, and Ethnology. The International Airport of Rio de Janeiro (Gale\u00e3o \u2013 Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport, named after the famous Brazilian musician Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim), the main campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro at the Fund\u00e3o Island, and the State University of Rio de Janeiro, in Maracan\u00e3, are also located in the Northern part of Rio.\nThis region is also home to most of the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Imp\u00e9rio Serrano, Unidos da Tijuca, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, among others. Some of the main neighbourhoods of Rio's North Zone are Alto da Boa Vista which shares the Tijuca Rainforest with the South and Southwest Zones; Tijuca, Vila Isabel, M\u00e9ier, S\u00e3o Cristov\u00e3o, Madureira, Penha, Manguinhos, Fund\u00e3o, Olaria among others. Many of Rio de Janeiro's roughly 1000 slums, or favelas, are located in the North Zone.  The favelas resemble the slums of Paris, New York or other major cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States and Europe, or similar neighborhoods in present underdeveloped countries.\n\n\n=== West Zone ===\n\nWest Zone (Zona Oeste) of Rio de Janeiro is a vaguely defined area that covers some 50% of the city's entire area, including Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhoods. The West Side of Rio has many historic sites because of the old \"Royal Road of Santa Cruz\" that crossed the territory in the regions of Realengo, Bangu, and Campo Grande, finishing at the Royal Palace of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz region. The highest peak of the city of Rio de Janeiro is the Pedra Branca Peak (Pico da Pedra Branca) inside the Pedra Branca State Park. It has an altitude of 1024m. The Pedra Branca State Park (Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca) is the biggest urban state park in the world comprising 17 neighborhoods in the west side, being a \"giant lung\" in the city with trails, waterfalls and historic constructions like an old aqueduct in the Col\u00f4nia Juliano Moreira in the neighborhood of Taquara and a dam in Camorim. The park has three principal entrances: the main one is in Taquara called Pau da Fome Core, another entrance is the Piraquara Core in Realengo and the last one is the Camorim Core, considered the cultural heritage of the city.\nSanta Cruz and Campo Grande Region have exhibited economic growth, mainly in the Campo Grande neighborhood. Industrial enterprises are being built in lower and lower middle class residential Santa Cruz, one of the largest and most populous of Rio de Janeiro's neighbourhoods, most notably Ternium Brasil, a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, which is planned to be South America's largest steel works. A tunnel called T\u00fanel da Grota Funda, opened in 2012, creating a public transit facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz, lessening travel time to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Barra da Tijuca region ===\n\nThis is an elite area of the West Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It includes Barra da Tijuca, Recreio dos Bandeirantes, Vargem Grande, Vargem Pequena, Grumari, Itanhang\u00e1, Camorim and Jo\u00e1. Westwards from the older zones of Rio, Barra da Tijuca is a flat complex of barrier islands of formerly undeveloped coastal land, which constantly experiences new constructions and developments. It remains an area of accelerated growth, attracting some of the richer sectors of the population as well as luxury companies. High rise flats and sprawling shopping centers give the area a far more modern feel than the crowded city centre.\nThe urban planning of the area, completed in the late 1960s, mixes zones of single-family houses with residential skyscrapers. The beaches of Barra da Tijuca are also popular with the residents from other parts of the city. One of the most famous hills in the city is the 842-metre-high (2,762-foot) Pedra da G\u00e1vea (Crow's nest Rock) bordering the South Zone. On the top of its summit is a huge rock formation (some, such as Erich von D\u00e4niken in his 1973 book, In Search of Ancient Gods, claim it to be a sculpture) resembling a sphinx-like, bearded head that is visible for many kilometres around.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 5,940,224 people residing in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The census revealed the following numbers: 3,239,888 White people (51.2%), 2,318,675 Pardo (multiracial) people (36.5%), 708,148 Black people (11.5%), 45,913 Asian people (0.7%), 5,981 Amerindian people (0.1%). The population of Rio de Janeiro was 53.2% female and 46.8% male.In 2010, the city of Rio de Janeiro was the 2nd most populous city in Brazil, after S\u00e3o Paulo.Different ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different indigenous peoples speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the French were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.Rio de Janeiro is home to the largest Portuguese population outside of Lisbon in Portugal. After independence from Portugal, Rio de Janeiro became a destination for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Portugal, mainly in the early 20th century. The immigrants were mostly poor peasants who subsequently found prosperity in Rio as city workers and small traders. The Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and language. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, fluminense, and other Brazilian dialects.\n\nPeople of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.\nThe black community was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from Angola and Mozambique, as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and West African descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city.\nToday, nearly half of the city's population is by phenotype perceptibly black or part black. A large majority has some recent sub-Saharan ancestor. White in Brazil is defined more by having a European-looking phenotype rather than ancestry, and two full siblings can be of different \"racial\" categories in a skin color and phenotype continuum from p\u00e1lido (branco) or fair-skinned, through branco moreno or swarthy Caucasian, mesti\u00e7o claro or lighter skinned multiracial, pardo (mixed race) to negro or black. Pardo, for example, in popular usage includes those who are caboclos (mestizos), mulatos (mulattoes), cafuzos (zambos), ju\u00e7aras (archaic term for tri-racials) and westernized Amerindians (which are called caboclos as well), being more of a skin color rather than a racial group in particular.\nAs a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area are communities of Levantine Arabs who are mostly Christian or Irreligious, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese, Jews, and people from other parts of Brazil. The main waves of internal migration came from people of African, mixed or older Portuguese (as descendants of early settlers) descent from Minas Gerais and people of Eastern European, Swiss, Italian, German, Portuguese and older Portuguese-Brazilian heritage from Esp\u00edrito Santo in the early and mid-20th century, together with people with origins in Northeastern Brazil, in the mid-to-late and late 20th century, as well some in the early 21st century (the latter more directed to peripheries than the city's core).\n\nAccording to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro, the \"pardos\" there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the \"whites\" (who thought of themselves as \"very mixed\") were found to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The \"pardos\" for example thought of themselves as \u2153 European, \u2153 African and \u2153 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European. Other studies showed similar results\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\nRio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil (after S\u00e3o Paulo) and has a rapidly expanding population and rapidly growing area due to rapid urbanization.\n\nChanging demographics the city of Rio de Janeiro\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, according to 2009 research from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas (known as Novo Mapa das Religi\u00f5es), is mostly Catholic (51.1%). Rio de Janeiro city also ranks fifth among Brazilian state capital cities in the percentage of its population that is irreligious (13.3%), barely changing since 2000 (the first-ranked, Boa Vista, has 21.2% irreligious). It is also the Brazilian state capital with the greatest percentage of Spiritists (now about 4\u20135%), and with substantial numbers in Afro-Brazilian religions and Eastern religions.\n\n\n== Social issues ==\n\nThere are significant disparities between the rich and the poor in Rio de Janeiro, and different socioeconomic groups are largely segregated into different neighborhoods. Although the city clearly ranks among the world's major metropolises, large numbers live in slums known as favelas, where 95% of the population are poor, compared to 40% in the general population.There have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to housing projects such as Cidade de Deus to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas and bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the \"Favela Bairro\" program and deployment of Pacifying Police Units.\nRio has more people living in slums than any other city in Brazil, according to the 2010 Census. More than 1,500,000 people live in its 763 favelas, 22% of Rio's total population. S\u00e3o Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, has more favelas (1,020) in sheer numbers, but proportionally has fewer people living in favelas than Rio.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nRio de Janeiro has the second largest GDP of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by S\u00e3o Paulo. According to the IBGE, it was approximately US$201 billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban metropolis (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.Greater Rio de Janeiro, as perceived by the IBGE, has a GDP of US$187 billion, constituting the second largest hub of national wealth. Per capita GDP is US$11,786. It concentrates 68% of the state's economic strength and 7.9% of all goods and services produced in the country. The services sector comprises the largest portion of GDP (65.5%), followed by commerce (23.4%), industrial activities (11.1%) and agriculture (0.1%).Benefiting from the federal capital position it had for a long period (1763\u20131960), the city became a dynamic administrative, financial, commercial and cultural center. Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. The city was chosen as headquarters for state-owned companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, National Economic and Social Development Bank and Vale (which was privatized in the 1990s). The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845. Despite the transfer of the capital to Bras\u00edlia in 1960, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area.\nThe off-shore oil exploration in the Campos Basin began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of Shell, EBX and Esso. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil, with oil refineries, shipbuilding industries, steel, metallurgy, petrochemicals, cement, pharmaceutical, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.\n\nMajor international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: Merck, Roche, Arrow, Darrow, Baxter, Mayne, and Mappel. A newer electronics and computer sector has been added to the more-established industries. Construction, also an important activity, provides a significant source of employment for large numbers of unskilled workers and is buoyed by the number of seasonal residents who build second homes in the Greater Rio de Janeiro area.\nRio is an important financial centre, second only to S\u00e3o Paulo in volume of business. Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to S\u00e3o Paulo, is still of major importance. Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses. The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as Intelig, Oi and Embratel. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: Jornal do Brasil, O Dia, and Business Rio.\nTourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life. The city is the nation's top tourist attraction for both Brazilians and foreigners.To attract industry, the state government has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.Owing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the Centre, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centres, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.Rio de Janeiro is (as of 2014) the second largest exporting municipality in Brazil.  Annually, Rio exported a total of $7.49B (USD) worth of goods.  The top three goods exported by the municipality were crude petroleum (40%), semi finished iron product (16%), and semi finished steel products (11%).  Material categories of mineral products (42%) and metals (29%) make up 71% of all exports from Rio.Compared to other cities, Rio de Janeiro's economy is the 2nd largest in Brazil, behind S\u00e3o Paulo, and the 30th largest in the world with a GDP of R$ 201,9 billion in 2010. The per capita income for the city was R$22,903 in 2007 (around US$14,630). Largely because of the strength of Brazil's currency at the time, Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, reported that Rio de Janeiro ranked 12th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2011, up from the 29th position in 2010, just behind S\u00e3o Paulo (ranked 10th), and ahead of London, Paris, Milan, and New York City. Rio also had the most expensive hotel rates in Brazil, and the daily rate of its five star hotels were the second most expensive in the world after only New York City.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nRio de Janeiro is Brazil's primary tourist attraction and resort. It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82 million international tourists a year.The city boasts world-class hotels, like Belmond Copacabana Palace, approximately 80 kilometres of beaches and the famous Corcovado, Sugarloaf mountains and Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.The fact that Bras\u00edlia replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that S\u00e3o Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.Rio de Janeiro's government has since undertaken to modernise the city's economy, reduce its chronic social inequalities, and improve its commercial standing as part of an initiative for the regeneration of the tourism industry.The city is an important global LGBT destination, 1 million LGBT tourists visiting each year. The Rua Farme de Amoedo is located in Ipanema, a famous neighborhood in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The street and the nearby beach, famous tourist spots, are remarkable for their popularity in the LGBT community. Rio de Janeiro is the most awarded destination by World Travel Awards in the South American category of \"best destination\".\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Portuguese language is the official and national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum. There are also international schools, such as the American School of Rio de Janeiro, Our Lady of Mercy School, the Corcovado German School, the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais and the British School of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Educational institutions ===\n\nThe city has several universities and research institutes. The Ministry of Education has certified approximately 99 upper-learning institutions in Rio.The most prestigious university is the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. It is the fifth best in Latin America; the second best in Brazil, second only to the University of S\u00e3o Paulo; and the best in Latin America, according to the QS World University Rankings.Some notable higher education institutions are Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ); Federal University of the Rio de Janeiro state (UNIRIO); Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ); Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ, often nicknamed Rural); Fluminense Federal University (UFF); Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio); Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation (FGV); Military Institute of Engineering (IME); Superior Institute of Technology in Computer Science of Rio de Janeiro (IST-Rio); College of Publicity and Marketing (ESPM); National Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA); Superior institute of Education of Rio de Janeiro (ISERJ) and Federal Center of Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ). There are more than 137 upper-learning institutions in whole Rio de Janeiro state.\n\n\n=== Educational system ===\nPrimary schools are largely under municipal administration, while the state plays a more significant role in the extensive network of secondary schools. There are also a small number of schools under federal administration, as is the case of Pedro II School, Col\u00e9gio de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da UFRJ and the Centro Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET-RJ). In addition, Rio has an ample offering of private schools that provide education at all levels. Rio is home to many colleges and universities.  The literacy rate for cariocas aged 10 and older is nearly 95 percent, well above the national average.The Rio de Janeiro State University (public), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (public), Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets (private) and Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (private) are among the country's top institutions of higher education.  Other institutes of higher learning include the Col\u00e9gio Regina Coeli in Usina, notable for having its own 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge funicular railway on its grounds.In Rio, there were 1,033 primary schools with 25,594 teachers and 667,788 students in 1995. There are 370 secondary schools with 9,699 teachers and 227,892 students. There are 53 University-preparatory schools with 14,864 teachers and 154,447 students. The city has six major universities and 47 private schools of higher learning.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nRio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the Portuguese Imperial family and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by Portuguese, English, and French architecture.Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival has been held annually since 1999.Rio currently brings together the main production centers of Brazilian television. Major international films set in Rio de Janeiro include Blame it on Rio; the James Bond film Moonraker; the Oscar award-winning, critically acclaimed Central Station by Walter Salles, who is also one of Brazil's best-known directors; and the Oscar award-winning historical drama, Black Orpheus, which depicted the early days of Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. Internationally famous, Brazilian-made movies illustrating a darker side of Rio de Janeiro include Elite Squad and City of God.\n\nRio has many important cultural landmarks, such as the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library), one of the largest libraries in the world with collections totalling more than 9 million items; the Theatro Municipal; the National Museum of Fine Arts; the Carmen Miranda Museum; the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden; the Parque Lage; the Quinta da Boa Vista; the Imperial Square; the Brazilian Academy of Letters; the Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro; and the Natural History Museum.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nAfter Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a European-style bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. Joaquim Manuel de Macedo's A Moreninha (1844) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune.\n\nThe first notable work of realism focusing on the urban lower-middle class is Manuel Ant\u00f4nio de Almeida's Mem\u00f3rias de um sargento de mil\u00edcias (1854), which presents a series of picaresque but touching scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.The most famous author of Rio de Janeiro, however, was Machado de Assis, who is also widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literature and considered the founder of Realism in Brazil, with the publication of The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (1881). He commented on and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from Empire to Republic with his numerous chronicles published in newspapers of the time. Many of his short stories and novels, like Quincas Borba (1891) and Dom Casmurro (1899), are placed in Rio.\nThe headquarters of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is based in Rio de Janeiro. It was satirized by the novelist Jorge Amado in Pen, Sword, Camisole. Amado, himself, went on to be one of the 40 members of the Academy.\n\n\n==== Libraries ====\n\nThe Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America. Located in Cinel\u00e2ndia, the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the History of Portugal and Brazil; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Ant\u00f4nio de Ara\u00fajo de Azevedo, the \"Count of Barca\", including the 125-volume set of prints \"Le Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Univers;\" a collection of documents regarding the Jesu\u00edtica Province of Paraguay and the \"Region of Prata;\" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by Emperor Pedro II. The collection contains 48,236 items. Individual items of special interest include a rare first edition of Os Lus\u00edadas by Luis de Cam\u00f5es, published in 1584; two copies of the Mog\u00fancia Bible; and a first edition of Handel's Messiah.The Real Gabinete Portugu\u00eas de Leitura (Portuguese Royal Reading Library) is located at Rua Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, in the Centro (Downtown). The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three Portuguese immigrants, political refugees, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire. The history of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is linked to the Real Gabinete, since some of the early meetings of the Academy were held there.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe official song of Rio de Janeiro is \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", which means \"marvelous city\". The song is considered the civic anthem of Rio, and is always the favourite song during Rio's Carnival in February. Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, are considered the centre of the urban music movement in Brazil.\"Rio was popularised by the hit song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", composed by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes and recorded by Astrud Gilberto and Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. It is also the main key song of the bossa nova, a music genre born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is Funk Carioca. While samba music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of electronic music associated with the current US black music scene, including hip hop, modern soul, and house music.\"Brazil's return to democracy in 1985 after over 20 years of military authoritarian rule, and the subsequent end of rampant censorship, allowed for a new freedom of expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture. Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the Punk in Brazil, and that of Brazilian thrash metal. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nRio de Janeiro's Theatro Municipal is one of the most attractive buildings in the central area of the city. Home of one of the largest stages in Latin America and one of Brazil's best known venues for opera, ballet, and classical music, the building was inspired by the Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera. Construction of the Theatro Municipal began in 1905 following designs of the architect Francisco Pereira Passos. The statues on the top, of two women representing Poetry and Music, are by Rodolfo Bernardelli, and the interior is rich with furnishings and fine paintings. Inaugurated in 1909, the Teatro Municipal has close to 1,700 seats. Its interior includes turn of the century stained glass from France, ceilings of rose-colored marble and a 1,000 pound crystal bead chandelier surrounded by a painting of the \"Dance of the Hours\". The exterior walls of the building are dotted with inscriptions bearing the names of famous Brazilians as well as many other international celebrities.Cidade das Artes (City of Arts) is a cultural complex in Barra da Tijuca in the Southwest Zone of Rio de Janeiro, which was originally planned to open in 2004. Formally known as \"Cidade da M\u00fasica\" (City of Music), it was finally inaugurated at the beginning of 2013.\nThe project will host the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra becoming a main center for music as will be the largest modern concert hall in South America, with 1,780 seats. The complex spans approximately 90 thousand square metres (1 million square feet) and also features a chamber music hall, three theaters, and 12 rehearsal rooms. From the terrace there is a panoramic view of the zone. The building was designed by the French architect Christian de Portzamparc and construction was funded by the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\n\n==== New Year's Eve ====\n\nEvery 31 December, 2.5 million people gather at Copacabana Beach to celebrate New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all night at the hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second largest celebration only next to the Carnival. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the champagne bottle and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds to the spirit of the festivities.\n\n\n==== Rock in Rio ====\n\n\"Rock in Rio\" is a music festival conceived by entrepreneur Roberto Medina for the first time in 1985, and since its creation, recognized as the largest music festival in the Latin world and the largest in the world, with 1.5 million people attending the first event, 700,000 attending the second and fourth, about 1.2 million attending the third, and about 350,000 people attending each of the 3 Lisbon events. It was originally organized in Rio de Janeiro, from where the name comes from, has become a world level event and, in 2004, had its first edition abroad in Lisbon, Portugal, before Madrid, Spain and Las Vegas, United States. The festival is considered the eighth best in the world by the specialized site Fling Festival.\n\n\n==== Carnival ====\n\nCarnaval, is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40 days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had Bourbon and Austrian ancestors. Up until the time of the marchinhas, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music became more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the famous samba school (Escolas de Samba) parades in the sambadrome exhibition center and the popular blocos de carnaval, street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city. The most famous ones are:\n\nCord\u00e3o do Bola Preta: Parades in the centre of the city. It is one of the most traditional carnavals. In 2008, 500,000 people attended in one day. In 2011, a record 2 million people attended the city covering three different metro stations.\nSuvaco do Cristo: Band that parades in the Botanic Garden, directly below the Redeemer statue's arm. The name translates to 'Christ's armpit' in English, and was chosen for that reason.\nCarmelitas: Band that was supposedly created by nuns, but in fact is just a theme chosen by the band. It parades in Santa Teresa, a bairro from where one can see extensive panoramas.\nSimpatia \u00e9 Quase Amor: One of the most popular parades in Ipanema. Translates as 'Friendliness is almost love'.\nBanda de Ipanema: The most traditional in Ipanema. It attracts a wide range of revellers, including families and a wide spectrum of the LGBT/Queer population (notably drag queens).In 1840, the first Carnaval was celebrated with a masked ball. As years passed, adorned floats and costumed revelers became a tradition among the celebrants. Carnaval is known as a historic root of Brazilian music.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n \n\nAs in the rest of Brazil, association football is the most popular sport. The city's major teams are Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Fluminense and Botafogo. Madureira, Bangu, Portuguesa, America and Bonsucesso are small clubs. Famous players born in the city include Ronaldo and Rom\u00e1rio.Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team's matches. The Maracan\u00e3 was also the location of the infamous tournament-deciding match between Uruguay and Brazil, where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2\u20131 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracan\u00e3 hosted seven matches, including the final, where Germany beat Argentina 1\u20130.\n\n\n=== Olympics ===\n\nOn 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee selected Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Olympics. Rio made their first bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics, but lost to Berlin. They later made bids for the 2004 and 2012 Games, but failed to become a candidate city both times. Those games were awarded to Athens and London respectively.Rio is the first Brazilian and South American city to host the Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro also became the first city in the southern hemisphere outside of Australia to host the games \u2013 Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. In July 2007, Rio successfully organized and hosted the XV Pan American Games.\nRio de Janeiro also hosted the 2011 Military World Games from 15\u201324 July 2011. The 2011 Military World Games were the largest military sports event ever held in Brazil, with approximately 4,900 athletes from 108 countries competing in 20 sports.Rio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics. The Olympic Games were held from 5 to 21 August 2016. The Paralympics were held from 7 to 18 September 2016.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nThe city has a history as host of major international sports events. The Gin\u00e1sio do Maracan\u00e3zinho was the host arena for the official FIBA Basketball World Championship for its 1954 and 1963 editions. Later, the Jacarepagu\u00e1 circuit in Rio de Janeiro was the site for the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix from 1978 to 1989. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the MotoGP Brazilian Grand Prix from 1995 to 2004 and the Champ Car event from 1996 to 1999. WCT/WQS surfing championships were contested on the beaches from 1985 to 2001. The Rio Champions Cup Tennis tournament is held in the spring. As part of its preparations to host the 2007 Pan American Games, Rio built a new stadium, Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange, to hold 45,000 people. It was named after Brazilian ex-FIFA president Jo\u00e3o Havelange. The stadium is owned by the city of Rio de Janeiro, but it was rented to Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas for 20 years. Rio de Janeiro has also a multi-purpose arena, the HSBC Arena.\n\nThe Brazilian Dance/Sport/Martial art Capoeira is very popular. Other popular sports are basketball, beach football, beach volleyball, Beach American Football, footvolley, surfing, kite surfing, hang gliding, motor racing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, sailing, and competitive rowing. Another sport that is highly popular in beaches of Rio is called \"Frescobol\" (pronounced [f\u027ee\u031e\u0255ko\u031e\u02c8b\u0254w]), a type of beach tennis. Rio de Janeiro is also paradise for rock climbers, with hundreds of routes all over the city, ranging from easy boulders to highly technical big wall climbs, all inside the city. The most famous, Rio's granite mountain, the Sugar Loaf (P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar), is an example, with routes from the easy third grade (American 5.4, French 3) to the extremely difficult ninth grade (5.13/8b), up to 280 metres (919 feet).\nHorse racing events are held Thursday nights and weekend afternoons at Hip\u00f3dromo da G\u00e1vea. An impressive place with excellent grass and dirt tracks, it runs the best horses in the nation. Hang gliding in Rio de Janeiro started in the mid-1970s and quickly proved to be well-suited for this town, because of its geography: steep mountains encounter the Atlantic Ocean, which provide excellent take-off locations and great landing zones on the beach.\nOne of the most popular sea sports in the city is yachting. The main yacht clubs are in Botafogo area that extends halfway between Copacabana and the center of town. Though the most exclusive and interesting is probably the Rio Yacht club, where high society makes it a point to congregate. Most yacht clubs are open to members only and gate crashing is not easy. Copacabana is also a great place to surf, as well as \"Arpoador of Ipanema\" beach and \"Praia dos Bandeirantes\". The sea at these beaches is rough and dangerous, and the best surfers from Brazil and other sites of the world come to these beaches to prove themselves.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro is served by the following airports for use:\n\nGale\u00e3o\u2013Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport: used for all international and most of the domestic flights. Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to the city. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Gale\u00e3o has connections to 19 countries. It has a capacity to handle up to 30 million users a year in two passenger terminals. It is located 20 km (12 mi) from downtown Rio. The airport complex also has Brazil's longest runway at 4,000 m (13,123.36 ft), and one of South America's largest cargo logistics terminals. The airport is connected to the express bus service.\nSantos Dumont Airport: used mainly by the services to S\u00e3o Paulo, some short and medium-haul domestic flights, and general aviation. Located on Guanabara Bay just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Rio, during the 1990s Santos-Dumont began to outgrow its capacity, besides diverging from its specialization on short-hop flights, offering routes to other destinations in Brazil. For this reason, in late 2004 Santos-Dumont returned to its original condition of operating only shuttle flights to and from Congonhas Airport in S\u00e3o Paulo, along with regional aviation. The passenger terminal has undergone extensive renovation and expansion, which increased its capacity to 9,9 million users a year. The airport is connected to the city light rail system (Rio de Janeiro Light Rail), which connects several transport systems to downtown.\nJacarepagu\u00e1-Roberto Marinho Airport: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil Flying club). The airport is located in the district of Baixada de Jacarepagu\u00e1, within the municipality of Rio de Janeiro approximately 30 km (19 mi) from the city center.Military airports include:\n\nGale\u00e3o Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase, sharing some facilities with Gale\u00e3o - Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport;\nSanta Cruz Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase. Formerly called Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o Airport, it was built by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. Today it is one of the most important Air Force Bases in Brazil;\nAfonsos Air Force Base: One of the historical Brazilian Air Force airbases. It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea), the Museu Aeroespacial, and where air shows take place.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\n\nThe Port of Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's third busiest port in terms of cargo volume, and it is the center for cruise vessels. Located on the west coast of the Guanabara Bay, it serves the States of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Esp\u00edrito Santo. The port is managed by Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro. The Port of Rio de Janeiro covers territory from the Mau\u00e1 Pier in the east to the Wharf of the Cashew in the north. The Port of Rio de Janeiro contains almost seven thousand metres (23 thousand feet) of continuous wharf and an 883-metre (2,897-foot) pier. The Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro administers directly the Wharf of the Gamboa general cargo terminal; the wheat terminal with two warehouses capable of moving 300 tons of grains; General Load Terminal 2 with warehouses covering over 20 thousand square metres (215 thousand square feet); and the Wharves of Are Cristovao with terminals for wheat and liquid bulk.At the Wharf of Gamboa, leaseholders operate terminals for sugar, paper, iron and steel products. Leaseholders at the Wharf of the Cashew operate terminals for roll-on/roll-off cargoes, containers, and liquid bulk. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over seven million tons of cargo on almost 1700 vessels. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over two million tons of containerized cargo in almost 171 thousand TEUs. The port handled 852 thousand tons of wheat, more than 1.8 million tons of iron and steel, over a million tons of liquid bulk cargo, almost 830 thousand tons of dry bulk, over five thousand tons of paper goods, and over 78 thousand vehicles. In 2003, over 91 thousand passengers moved through the Port of Rio Janeiro on 83 cruise vessels.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, buses are the main form of public transportation. There are nearly 440 municipal bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio's transportation policy has been moving towards trains and subway in order to reduce surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in S\u00e3o Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rio de Janeiro, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 95 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 min, while 35% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 12.3 km, while 37% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Subway and urban trains ====\n\nRio de Janeiro has three subway lines (Metr\u00f4 Rio) with 58 kilometres (36 mi) and 41 stations plus several commuter rail lines. Future plans include building a fourth subway line to Niter\u00f3i and S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, including an underwater tunnel beneath Guanabara Bay to supplement the ferry service currently there. The Metro is Rio's safest and cleanest form of public transport.\n\nThe three lines serve the city seven days a week. The first line runs from General Os\u00f3rio in Ipanema to Uruguai Station in Tijuca. The second line runs from Botafogo, sharing ten stations with the first line, terminating at Pavuna in northern Rio. The third connects General Os\u00f3rio to Jardim Oce\u00e2nico Station, in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, where the 2016 Olympic Games were held. The Metro runs services from 05:00 am to 12:00 midnight, Monday to Saturday, and from 07:00 am to 11:00 pm Sundays and public holidays. People can buy tickets for the Metro at train stations and can either buy single tickets or rechargeable cards. People can also buy tickets for the Metro at buses that make connect places far from the Metro. Integration with buses are possible in several forms, an integrated Metro and bus ticket for a single journey is available for some lines paying an additional fee and is known as an Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Expressa (Express Integration) and Expresso Barra, the other possibility is taking the Metro na Superf\u00edcie (Surface Metro) with no additional fee.SuperVia connects the city of Rio with other locations in Greater Rio de Janeiro with surface trains. It has 8 lines and 270 kilometres (168 mi), with 102 stations.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\n\nIn order to improve traffic in the central zone, the prefecture started the project \"Porto Maravilha\" (Marvelous Port), which foresees a modern tramway system. Its lines will connect the central business district to Santos Dumont Airport, the ferry station at XV Square, the Novo Rio terminal bus station at Santo Cristo, and the future high-speed rail Leopoldina station between Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.In 2016, for the Olympic Games, the light rail system was inaugurated, with 28 km, 42 stations, distributed in 3 lines. The trams are the first in the world to use a combination of ground-level power supply (APS) and on-board supercapacitor energy storage (SRS), in order to eliminate overhead lines along the entire route.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\n\nCity buses cost about R$3.80 to ride. They come in both non-air conditioned (R$3.80) and air conditioned versions (R$3\u2013R$5.40). The system may be relatively safe by day but less so at night. Integration of bus lines has been recently implemented, allowing users to take two non-air conditioned bus rides in two hours paying just one ticket. It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the \"Bilhete \u00danico Carioca (BUC)\") in order to benefit of this system.\nAnother type of local bus is called the \"Fresc\u00e3o\" (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned \u2013 about 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) \u2013 more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$6.00\u2013R$12.00. However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing \"Castelo\").\n\n\n==== Ferry ====\n\nThe most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of Guanabara Bay is Niter\u00f3i. Many people who live in Niter\u00f3i, as well its neighbouring municipalities S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo and Maric\u00e1, commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro (Pra\u00e7a XV) and Niter\u00f3i (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several \"fast cat\" hydrofoil boats.\nOne of the city neighborhoods is Paquet\u00e1 Island, which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquet\u00e1 leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to Cocot\u00e1.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nRio de Janeiro has the oldest operating electric tramway in Brazil and South America, now mainly used by tourists and less by daily commuters. Santa Teresa Tram or bondinho, has been preserved both as a piece of history and as a quick, fun, cheap way of getting to one of the most quirky parts of the city.\n\nThe tram station is near Cinel\u00e2ndia and the Municipal Theatre. Trams leave every half an hour between 6:00 am and 11:00 pm. A ticket is just R$0.60 (US$0.35), one way or return, and people pay as they pass through the barrier to the right of the entrance. The Santa Teresa Tram (known locally as the \"bonde\") in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro commenced electric operation in 1891, replacing horse-drawn trams and expanding the horse-drawn route. At this time the gauge was altered to 1,100 mm (43.31 in), which remains the case today. The tram cars which are currently in operation are Brazilian-built, are of the cross-bench open sided design, and are fitted with trolley poles.After a derail occurred on 28 August 2011, which left seven dead, tram service was suspended to improve the system, and would be reopened in 2014, just before the 2014 FIFA World Cup but after postponements it was finally reopened in July 2015. While it is being improved, two lines costing R$0.60 carry passengers from Santa Teresa to Centro: SE014 and SE006.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n\nDriving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Am\u00e9ricas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common. Because of the organization of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighbourhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Gale\u00e3o International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Am\u00e9ricas).\nIn Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbour States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to S\u00e3o Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niter\u00f3i bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From S\u00e3o Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040. From Salvador: BR-101 or BR-324/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\n\nThe city has 160 km (99 mi) of cycle paths that, wherever they exist, are very much preferable to riding in the city's traffic. Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the Marina da Gl\u00f3ria, Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. six kilometres (3.7 miles) of cycle paths traverse the Tijuca National Park.The Bike Rio began operations in October 2011. This bicycle sharing system is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with Banco Ita\u00fa. The bike sharing system has 600 bicycles available at 60 rental stations in 14 neighborhoods throughout the city.\n\n\n== Communications ==\nThe dialing code for the city of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) is 21.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nRio de Janeiro is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partner cities ===\nRio de Janeiro has the following partner/friendship cities:\n\n\n=== Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities ===\nRio de Janeiro is a part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Movies ===\n\nThe 1979 James Bond movie Moonraker features scenes in Rio de Janeiro including an action sequence on a cable car atop Sugarloaf Mountain between James Bond (Roger Moore) and multiple-time Bond adversary, Jaws (Richard Kiel).\nThe movie Rio and its sequel, Rio 2, were mainly set in Rio de Janeiro and the Amazon rainforest.\nFast and Furious 5 (Fast Five)\nThe Incredible Hulk, where Bruce Banner seeks hiding at Rocinha\n\n\n=== Television ===\nAn episode of Littlest Pet Shop, \"Plane it on Rio\", featured Blythe and the pets going to the Carnival, but an old enemy shows up, determined to defeat them.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nRio de Janeiro appears in the driving game Driver 2 as a city to unlock through playing the game in the Undercover (story) game mode and then being playable in the other game modes.\nAngry Birds Rio featured the birds from the Angry Birds series and characters from Rio freeing exotic birds or defeating Nigel's marmosets in Rio de Janeiro.\nRio de Janeiro was featured in the game Asphalt 8: Airborne as a racing location.\nGangstar Rio: City of Saints, the sixth (or arguably, the seventh) installment overall in the Gangstar series, is (arguably, as this is claimed by the publisher, Gameloft) the first action-adventure video game to be set in Rio de Janeiro.\nRio de Janeiro was featured in the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.\nRio de Janeiro was featured in the racing game Forza Motorsport 6 as a street circuit.  The circuit and all of its configurations were also included in Forza Motorsport 7.\nRio de Janeiro appears as a playable map in Rainbow Six Siege, known as Favela.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of Rio de Janeiro\nList of people from Rio de Janeiro\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRio de Janeiro City Hall website (in Portuguese)\nback to Rio!

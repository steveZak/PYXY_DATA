        "wiki": "Lugano (, also UK: , Italian: [lu\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0no]; Ticinese: Lugan [ly\u02c8\u0261\u00e3\u02d0]) is a town and a municipality in southern Switzerland in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino bordering Italy. Being the largest city in Ticino, Lugano is also the biggest Italian-speaking urban area in Switzerland. \nThe between 2004 and 2013 territorially vastly expanded municipality has a population (as of December 2018) of 63,185, and an urban agglomeration of over 150,000. The ninth largest Swiss town, it is the largest in Ticino and largest with an Italian speaking majority outside of Italy. The town lies on Lake Lugano, surrounded by the mountains of the Lugano Prealps.\nThe eastern part of the municipality shares a border with Italy.\n\n\n== Name and coat of arms ==\nThe toponym is first recorded in 804, in the form Luanasco, in 874 as Luano, and from 1189 as Lugano.\nGerman-language variants of the name (now no longer in use) were Lowens, Lauis, Lauwis, Louwerz.\nThe local Lombard form of the name is rendered Lugan.\nThe etymology of the name is uncertain, suggestions include derivation from Latin lucus (\"grove\"), from a vulgar Latin lakvannus (\"lake-dweller\") and from the god Lugus.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nThe shores of Lake Lugano have been inhabited since the Stone Age. Within the modern town limits (Breganzona, Castagnola, Davesco and Gandria) a number of ground stones or quern-stones have been found. In the area surrounding Lugano, items from the Copper Age and the Iron Age have been found. There are Etruscan monuments at Davesco-Soragno (5th to 2nd century BC), Pregassona (3rd to 2nd century BC), and Viganello (3rd to 2nd century BC). Graves with jewelry and household items have been found in Aldesago, Davesco, Pazzallo and Pregassona along with Celtic money in Viganello.\nThe region around Lake Lugano was settled by the Romans by the 1st century BC. There was an important Roman town north of Lugano at Bioggio. There are fewer traces of the Romans in Lugano, but several inscriptions, graves and coins indicate that some Romans lived in what would become Lugano.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Lugano ===\nThe first written mention of a settlement at Lugano can be found in documents, which are of disputed authenticity, with which the Longobard king Liutprand ceded various assets located in Lugano to the Church of Saint Carpophorus in Como in 724. Other documents, dating from 804 and 844 refer to Lake Lugano as Laco Luanasco, and an act of 984 indicates Lugano as a market town.During the fighting between Guelphs and Ghibellines and the new disputes between Como and Milan, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Lugano was the scene of clashes between opposing forces. After a long rule by the Rusca family, Lugano was freed from the domination of Como, which had been taken over in 1335 by the Visconti. At the same time the link between town and the valley strengthened. By 1405\u201306 documents attest to a vallis comunitas Lugani et, a governing body that was independent of Como. The new community included the parishes of Lugano, Agno, Riva San Vitale and Capriasca. In 1416 the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, conquered the region of Lugano and the Rusca valley and made it a fief. A year later, Lugano's freedoms were first documented in a series of statutes modeled on those of Como. The town was able to secure complete independence.\n\n\n=== Lugano during the Renaissance and Enlightenment ===\nBetween 1433 and 1438 the Duke of Milan, Aloisio Sanseverino sat as a feudal lord over Lugano. He compensated the Rusca family with the ownership of Locarno. Under the reign of his heirs in the following decades rebellions and riots broke out, which lasted until the French invasion of 1499.\n\nIt was the object of continuous disputes between the Dukes of Como and Milan until it became a Swiss dominion in 1513. Swiss control lasted until 1798 when Napoleon conquered the Old Swiss Confederation and created the Helvetic Republic.\nIn 1746, the Agnelli brothers opened the first printing press and bookshop in Lugano. They began publishing the newspaper Nuove di diverse corti e paesi in 1748 and changed its name to Gazzetta di Lugano in 1797. The newspaper was widely read in north and central Italy. It supported the cause of the later Jansenists against the Jesuits and therefore was banned in 1768 in the territory of the Papal States. It was open to the themes of enlightened reform and the American Revolutionary War. It was the first newspaper in the Italian language to publish an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence of 1776. After the death of Abbot Gian Battista Agnelli in 1788, who had been the editor for more than 40 years, Abbot Giuseppe Lodovico Maria Vanelli took over the paper. Under Abbot Vanelli, it supported the revolutionary ideas from France, which drew protests from the Austrian government in Lombardy. The publication of the magazine ceased abruptly after edition number 17 of 29 April 1799, following the anti-French riots in Lugano during which the Agnelli printing house was sacked and Abbot Vanelli was shot.Under the Helvetic Republic, Lugano became the capital of the Canton of Lugano.\n\n\n=== Canton of Lugano ===\n\nThe canton of Lugano unified the former Landvogteien of Lugano, Mendrisio, Locarno and Valmaggia. However, as with the other cantons of the Helvetic Republic, the autonomy of Lugano was very limited, the republic having been founded by Napoleon in order further to centralise power in Switzerland. The canton was led by a Directory of five members, who appointed a \"national pr\u00e9fet\".The canton was deeply divided between \"patriots\" supporting the Cisalpine Republic, and traditionalist \"aristocrats\". By 1799 riots broke out in Lugano, and the second pr\u00e9fet, Francesco Capra, fled the town. Power passed to a provisional government sympathetic to the Habsburgs. However, French occupation was restored in 1800. Discontent continued and in early 1802 a revolt in Capriasca led to the autumn pronunciamento of Pian Povr\u00f2, which declared the independence of Lugano from the Helvetic client republic.\nWith the Act of Mediation, the following year, political agitation was finally quelled, as were the struggles between unionists and federalists. The canton of Lugano merged with Bellinzona creating the canton of Ticino, which endures to the present day.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter 1803, the political municipality of Lugano was created. One of the primary tasks of the new city government was to determine the division of property and authority between the patriziato and the new political municipality. Two agreements between the two organizations, in 1804 and 1810, began this process. In the second half of the 19th century, the political municipality received various properties and rights from the patriziato. Francesco Capra, the pr\u00e9fet during the Helvetic Republic, became the first mayor of Lugano from 1803 until 1813. The cantonal constitution of 1814, set Lugano, Bellinzona and Locarno as capitals of the Canton. They each served as the capital in a six-year rotation. Lugano was the capital in 1827\u201333, 1845\u201351 and 1863\u201369.In the 19th century, the city government was dominated by the Liberal Party. In 1900, slightly more than half of the seats on the city council (at the time 50 total members, but 60 members since 2004) were held by Liberals. Most of the rest of the seats were held by either Conservatives or Socialists.\nThe city government initially had eleven members, but in 1908 their number was reduced to five and in 2004 increased to seven. Throughout most of the 20th century, the Liberals held the absolute majority here as well. The rest of the municipal executive posts were held by the Conservatives, the Socialists (1944\u201348, 1976\u201380 and since 2000) and the Ticino League (since 1992).\nAround 1830 new civic and government buildings began to emerge in Lugano. The town also began to expand into the surrounding hills, along the Cassarate, and toward Molino Nuovo, Paradiso and Castagnola. In 1843\u201344 the city hall was built on the site of the Bishop's Palace (built in 1346). It housed the cantonal government in 1845\u201351 and again in 1863\u201369. Since 1890, it has housed the city government. The promenade was built in stages: first part was in the 1870s, a second in the first decade of the 20th century. In the first decades of the 19th century, the roads that connect Lugano with Bellinzona (1808\u201312), Ponte Tresa (1808\u201320) and Chiasso (1810\u201316) were built. In 1848 the first steamboat on Lake Lugano began to operate, with regular, scheduled service since 1856. The construction of the Melide causeway between Melide and Bissone in 1844\u201347 favored the development of the Chiasso-Bellinzona-Lugano-Gotthard line at the expense of the north\u2013south route along Lake Maggiore. This tendency for development was strengthened further in 1882 with the completion of the Gotthard railway line. The railway station was built in 1874\u201377 in Lugano, and transformed it into one of the main links between northern Italy and central and northern Europe, which led to the development of tourism and in general helped the services sector.\n\n\n=== Modern Lugano ===\n\nFrom the mid-19th century to 1970 the town recorded constant population growth, especially between 1880 and 1910, when the population more than doubled. This increase was partly due to foreign nationals settling in Lugano (in 1870 18.7% of the population, 1910 43.6%) and people from other language areas of Switzerland (1870 1.4% of the population, 1910 6.9%). In the last three decades of the 20th century, the population fell slightly, despite the merger in 1972, of the municipalities of Castagnola and Br\u00e8-Aldesago. This reflected a trend to move away from the town to the suburban communities.However, in 2004 the municipalities of Breganzona, Cureggia, Davesco-Soragno, Gandria, Pambio-Noranco, Pazzallo, Pregassona and Viganello were incorporated into the municipality. In 2008, they were followed by Barbengo, Carabbia and Villa Luganese. This, among other factors, resulted in a doubling of the population to 52,059 in 2006, of which over a third were foreigners. In 2013 the municipalities of Bogno, Cadro, Carona, Certara, Cimadera, Sonvico and Val Colla were incorporated into the municipality.\nFollowing the Second World War, and particularly during the 1960s and 70s, thanks to an abundant flow of capital from nearby Italy, Lugano was the first host-city of the 1956 Eurovision Song Contest. Lugano experienced a period of exponential growth in banking activities which led to it placing itself as the third financial centre of Switzerland, with over 100 banking institutions present in the town. Trade, tourism and finance are the mainstays of the local economy. In 2000, nine-tenths of the workers were employed in the services sector, of which three-quarters are commuters, including many cross-border commuters (13% of the working population).\nIn 1975, the Congress Center was built followed in 1978 by the new City Hospital. In 1963 the town acquired the land for the airfield Lugano-Agno, and the first scheduled flights was in 1980. At the beginning of the 21st century they began the Grande Lugano projects, including: the car tunnel Vedeggio-Cassarate, which started in 2005 and connects the A2 motorway with the neighborhood of Cornaredo, the creation of a new Kulturpol on the site of the former Grand H\u00f4tel Palace and a convention and exhibition center in the area of Campo Marzio.In June 2011, officials of the Israeli town of Yehud announced they would undertake a massive construction project to replicate Lugano's old square in the center of their town, to reinvigorate commerce and tourism. The replica will be replete with neoclassical columns and colonnades.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topology ===\n\nThe municipality Lugano lies at the edge of Lake Lugano (Italian: Lago di Lugano or Ceresio), which is situated between the lakes Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como, south of the Alps. It lies at the heart of the Sottoceneri, that part of the canton of Ticino that lies south of the Monte Ceneri Pass.The town centre is located on the lake shore just to the west of where the river Cassarate enters the lake. The town's waterfront forms a crescent around the bay between the Br\u00e8 (925 m [3,035 ft]) and the San Salvatore (912 m [2,992 ft]) mountains.Because of the historical development of the town, incorporating some relatively distant suburbs but leaving other, nearer, suburbs as independent municipalities, the borders of the town are disparate. A large and sparsely populated section of the town is on the east bank of Lake Lugano and separated from the town by that lake. Similarly, the inner-urban but independent municipality of Paradiso is a near-enclave, totally surrounded as it is by the municipality and the Lake Lugano.Based on the 1997 land survey, as of 2013 the municipality Lugano has a total area of 32.09 square kilometers (12.39 sq mi). Of this area, 3.25 km2 (1.25 sq mi) or 10.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 6.73 km2 (2.60 sq mi) or 21.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 4.48 km2 (1.73 sq mi) or 14.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.04 km2 (9.9 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.12 km2 (30 acres) or 0.4% is unproductive land.Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 9.4% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.0%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 1.2%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 0.5% is used for growing crops and 9.4% is used for alpine pastures. Almost all the water in the municipality is in lakes.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLugano has a rare humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) for the latitude, closely bordering on a subtropical oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) due to the warmer average being 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Although the US National Academy of Sciences considers a sea-like climate, the vegetation is from the subtropics with deciduous forest. It is characterized by relatively mild winters and warm humid summers.  It has an average of 98.1 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,559 mm (61.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which Lugano receives an average of 196 mm (7.7 in) of rain, while the driest month of the year is February with an average of 52 mm (2.0 in) of precipitation over 4.6 days.Located on a plains in southern Switzerland and protected by the Alps and lakes, the climate is one of the mildest in the country, most similar to northern Italy. In addition, the precipitation is lower than in many other places as well as the deviations of temperature. Lugano is also one of the sunniest Swiss cities. The greatest precipitates anticipate and succeed much of the summer. Winter freezing temperatures are more common on the night of January (between 27 and 28 days), but the low temperatures remains are rare and do not occur every year. Much of the summer is pleasant, but warm days above of the 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) are not uncommon (average of about 8 days).The highest temperature recorded in Lugano is 38.0 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), recorded in July 1945, whilst the lowest temperature recorded being \u221214.0 \u00b0C (6.8 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929.\n\nabout 8.64% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, a cross throughout argent, between the upper case serif letters L, V, G and A (respectively in the I, II, III and IV quarters). The coat of arms dates from around 1200. The four letters on the coat of arms are an abbreviation of the name Lugano.\n\n\n=== Quarters and circles ===\nThe municipality is subdivided into 25 quartieri (quarters) which are grouped into three (cantonal) circles.Quarters 1\u20139 are the older quarters of the town, which have been added to by successive enlargements of the municipality in 2004, 2008 and 2013; these enlargements involved previously independent municipalities becoming parts of the municipality.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== Local councils ====\nIn the 2007 Grand Council of Ticino election, there were a total of 27,557 registered voters in Lugano, of which 15,214 or 55.2% voted. 237 blank ballots and 38 null ballots were cast, leaving 14,939 valid ballots in the election.

Business, tourism and finance constitute the backbone of the local economy. In 2000, the tertiary sector offered 90% of all jobs in Lugano, of which 75% were occupied by commuters, many of which commute from neighbouring Italy (approximately 13% of the active working population); in the same year tax revenues reached CHF 104 million, of which CHF 59 million were attributable to the banking sector. The town is Switzerland's third largest banking centre after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva. With regards to intercommunal financial equalisation, thanks to its financial strength Lugano contributes significantly to the equalisation fund. The population is Italian-speaking and mainly Roman Catholic.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2007, the population changed at a rate of 6.9%.

The water is generally warm with average water temperatures in the summer ranging from 19.5 \u00b0C (67.1 \u00b0F) to 24.0 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F).Several companies, including the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL), provide tourist boat services on the lake. A popular excursion is by SNL boat to the picturesque lakeside village of Gandria. Additionally there are numerous shipyards, water taxis and boat rental sites along the lake, as well as hotels and restaurants that offer moorings. Bathing in the lake is allowed at any of the 50 or so bathing establishments located along the Swiss shores.In addition to the lake, Lugano is surrounded by mountains, which provide a number of opportunities for sports or sightseeing. Two mountains, both providing excellent views over the town and lake, bracket each end of the town's waterfront. Monte Br\u00e8 (933 metres (3,061 ft)), to the north, is reputedly Switzerland's sunniest spot and is also home to the old village of Br\u00e8. Monte San Salvatore (912 metres (2,992 ft)), to the south, has an old church and museum atop its summit. Both mountains are accessible by funicular railways, which are themselves easily accessible by frequent town bus or by car.\n\nSlightly further afield is Monte Generoso (1,704 metres (5,591 ft)), with a view that encompasses the lakes of Lugano, Como and Maggiore, as well as the Alps from the Matterhorn to the Bernina Range, the Lombardy Plains, and, on a clear day, the city of Milan. The summit can be reached by taking either an SNL boat, or a railway train, to Capolago, and changing there onto a rack railway train of the Monte Generoso Railway.\n\n\n=== Buildings ===\nSt. Lawrence Cathedral (9th and 15th century)\nSt. Mary of the Angels Church (16th century) with the fresco of the Christ's Passion from Bernardino Luini\nParco civico \u2013 Villa Ciani\nPiazza della Riforma\nVilla Favorita\nSan Rocco Church\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nLAC (Lugano Art and Culture), the cultural centre dedicated to visual arts, music and performing arts\nMuseo delle Culture (Museum of Cultures)\nMASI (Art Museum of Southern Switzerland)\nFoundation Aligi Sassu and Helenita Olivares\nHistorical Museum\nCantonal Museum on Natural History\nSwiss Customs Museum\nMunicipal Art Museum\nWilhelm Schmid Museum\nHermann Hesse Museum\nAlprose Chocolate Museum (Chocoland)\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nIn Lugano about 63.7% of the population (between age 25\u201364) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a University of Applied Sciences).In Lugano there were a total of 7,931 students (as of 2009). The Ticino education system provides up to three years of non-mandatory kindergarten and in Lugano there were 1,356 children in kindergarten. The primary school program lasts for five years and includes both a standard school and a special school. In the municipality, 2,280 students attended the standard primary schools and 129 students attended the special school. In the lower secondary school system, students either attend a two-year middle school followed by a two-year pre-apprenticeship or they attend a four-year program to prepare for higher education. There were 1,932 students in the two-year middle school and 47 in their pre-apprenticeship, while 884 students were in the four-year advanced program.\nThe upper secondary school includes several options, but at the end of the upper secondary program, a student will be prepared to enter a trade or to continue on to a university or college. In Ticino, vocational students may either attend school while working on their internship or apprenticeship (which takes three or four years) or may attend school followed by an internship or apprenticeship (which takes one year as a full-time student or one and a half to two years as a part-time student). There were 492 vocational students who were attending school full-time and 722 who attend part-time.\nThe professional program lasts three years and prepares a student for a job in engineering, nursing, computer science, business, tourism and similar fields. There were 89 students in the professional program. As of 2000, there were 3,537 students in Lugano who came from another municipality, while 887 residents attended schools outside the municipality.\nLugano is home to 2 libraries. These libraries include; the Biblioteca universitaria di Lugano and the Biblioteca cantonale Lugano. There was a combined total (as of 2008) of 448,811 books or other media in the libraries, and in the same year a total of 51,740 items were loaned out.Some of the schools and colleges in Lugano include:\n\nUniversit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana: This Swiss university, translated as \"University of Italian Switzerland\", is the home of the faculties of informatics, economics, and communication sciences.\nSwiss National Supercomputing Centre: an autonomous unit of ETH Z\u00fcrich that focuses on high-performance computing.\nDalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA): a non-profit oriented research institute for artificial intelligence, affiliated with both the Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana and SUPSI.\nFranklin University Switzerland: an American and Swiss accredited liberal arts college.\nThe American School In Switzerland: an international secondary school.\nSUPSI: University of Applied Science of Southern Switzerland.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLugano is served by Lugano Airport, in the nearby municipality of Agno. Currently, only Silver Air and Swiss Airlines operate to Lugano Airport. While there is limited service to Lugano's airport, Milan's airports are not that far away and provide access to a greater number of worldwide locations.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nLugano's railway station is situated on the historically and concurrently important Gotthard railway line, which links northern Switzerland with Ticino and Italy. Long-distance trains of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), together with international trains of Trenitalia, connect Lugano with the cities of northern Switzerland and with southern Milan.\nSince the inauguration of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in 2016 train connections between cities in Northern Switzerland, such as Z\u00fcrich, Luzern and Basel, and cities in the south, such as Bellinzona, Lugano, and Milan got even closer \u2013 they almost entirely circumvent the Alps.\nIn the future, connections to Bellinzona and the northern Swiss cities will even further improve with the opening of the Ceneri Base Tunnel in 2020.\nA two-hourly RegionalExpress RE connects Lugano with the local towns and villages on the historic Gotthard route with the northern ones on the other side of the Ceneri, such as Bellinzona and Biasca, where the fast trains enter the world's longest railway tunnel in order to underpass the Alps, and further up through the Valle Leventina up to Airolo and through the old Gotthard Tunnel (1,151 metres (3,776 feet)) to the German-speaking northern villages in Uri as far as Erstfeld.\nLugano is also served by several lines of regional trains of the Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia (TILO) network which operate in the canton of Ticino and northern Lombardia, Italy.\nSince August 2018 TILO's S50 connects Bellinzona and Lugano with Malpensa Airport once every hour with a travel time of 1:45h from/to Lugano.The S10 service connects Lugano once every half hour with the local towns and villages on the historic Gotthard route between southern Chiasso and northern Bellinzona.The RegionalExpress RE10 connects Lugano and Chiasso with Milano Centrale railway station in addition to the international long-distance trains in order to provide a fast connection once every hour; sometimes prolonged upwards to Bellinzona and Airolo, or even Erstfeld.Additionally, the metre gauge (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in gauge) Lugano-Ponte Tresa Railway (FLP) connects Lugano as the S60 from platform 11 outside the main building with the regional Lugano Airport and Ponte Tresa.From April until mid October, the tourist oriented Gotthard Panorama Express connects Lucerne with Lugano once a day via boat on the Lake Lucerne and then per train over the historic Gotthard route through the old, 500 metres (1,600 ft) higher situated Gotthard Tunnel.Lugano is also served by three funicular railways. The Funicolare Citt\u00e0\u2013Stazione, which has recently been renewed, is a short line connecting Lugano railway station to the lower town centre at the lake, whilst the Funicolare Monte Br\u00e8 and the Funicolare Monte San Salvatore ascend nearby hills to vantage points.\nA fourth funicular, the Funicolare degli Angioli, still exists but has not operated since 1986.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nLugano is located along the A2 motorway, a part of the European route E35 which over 1,600 km (990 mi) between Amsterdam and Rome.\nThe Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL) operate frequent inner town buses throughout Lugano and some of its closer neighbours.The Autolinee Regionali Luganesi (ARL) runs buses connecting Lugano with the districts of Davesco, Sonvico and the towns of Canobbio, Lamone and Tesserete, whilst the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) runs buses to the district of Gandria and Campione d'Italia. TPL, ARL and SNL services operate from the Lugano Centro bus station.\nLonger distance buses, as well as some local buses, are operated by PostBus Switzerland, known locally as the AutoPostale. Its Palm Express service connects Lugano railway station to St. Moritz. Other AutoPostale buses operate from an underground bus station and ticket office, located at Via Balestra 4 in the centre of Lugano.ASF Autolinee, an Italian bus company, operates an international bus route from Lugano to Menaggio, on the shores of Lake Como.\n\n\n=== Shipping ===\nBoats of the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano provide services on Lake Lugano. Whilst these are principally provided for tourist purposes, they also connect Lugano with other lakeside communities. Several of the landing points are within the sparsely populated section of the municipality that lies on the east side of lake, and have no road access.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nLugano hosts the Swiss National Sound Archives, responsible for safeguarding the sound heritage of Switzerland.\nThe Palazzo dei Congressi is the performing arts center for Lugano. It is a main venue for the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana.\n\nThe Blues-to-Bop Festival arrives in late August and early September turns the town into a hive of activity as thousands crowd the streets and piazzas for free open-air concerts.\nIn 1956, the Teatro Kursaal in Lugano hosted the first Eurovision Song Contest.The MASI (Museo d'Arte della Svizzera italiana) has two parallel objectives: the conservation and study of the Museum's permanent collection, which is above all made up of works belonging to the 19th and 20th centuries; and the planning and presentation of temporary exhibitions. It focuses on art of the cantons of Ticino and Graub\u00fcnden (Grigioni in Italian) and present artists from the region on a regular basis.The district of Br\u00e8-Aldesago offers its visitors charming corners created by its characteristic stone buildings. The cobble stone streets of the town offer art enthusiasts an artistic path that is very interesting both because of the presence of national and international \"names\" and the combination of art and the environment.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nHockey Club Lugano (HCL) plays in the National League (NL). They play at the Resega arena and have won seven national titles, having participated twice in the European Cup final round and once in the top four final in Euroleague. In 1991, Lugano reached the final of the famous Spengler Cup and twice reached third place in the IIHF Continental Cup Superfinal.FC Lugano plays in the Swiss Super League. They play at the Stadio Cornaredo and won the Swiss title in 1938, 1941 and 1949 and the Swiss Cup in 1931, 1968 and 1993. \nThe Stadio Cornaredo is the largest stadium in Lugano, with space for 15,000 people. It hosted the Italy-Belgium match at the 1954 FIFA World Cup. According to some sources, Lugano is the smallest town ever to hold a World Cup match. Around the soccer field there is a gravel lane used during athletic contests and that, outside of official match and training hours, can be used by joggers free of charge.  Next to the stadium are three small training fields. There are also two artificial grass fields: one for field hockey and one for soccer. There is also a skate park next to the stadium.\nBC Lugano Tigers (former Basket Club Lugano) plays in the Swiss National League A (LNA). They play at the Elvetico gym, won the Swiss Cup in 2011 and have been Swiss LNA Champions in 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2010.Lugano annually hosts the 20-kilometre (12 mi) racewalk Gran Premio Citt\u00e0 di Lugano Memorial Albisetti and the Ladies Open Lugano, an International level WTA tennis tournament. The town hosted the 1953 and 1996 UCI Road World Championships, as well as the 18th Chess Olympiad.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== People born in Lugano ===\n\nMiddle AgesGiovanni Battista Trevano (c.1560\u20131644) an Italian-speaking architect who worked in Poland as royal architect\nFrancesco Contin (1585\u20131654) a Swiss-Italian sculptor and architect\nGiovanni Battista Discepoli (1590\u20131660) was a Swiss-Italian painter of the Baroque period\nGasparo Molo (15??-16??), goldsmith\nCarlo Giuseppe Plura (1663\u20131737) a Swiss-Italian stucco artist and sculptor\nGiovanni Maria Fontana (c.1670\u2013after 1712) an Italian-Swiss architect, worked in Russia.\nGiacomo Zanetti (c.1696\u20131735) an Italian master builder and architect\nDomenico Reina (1796\u20131843) opera a Swiss bel canto tenor and composer19th CCarlo Bossoli (1815\u20131884) a Swiss-born Italian painter and lithographer of scenes from the Risorgimento\nDomenico Giambonini (1868\u20131956) a Swiss sport shooter, bronze medallist in the 1920 Summer Olympics20th CLeonardo Conti MD (1900\u20131945) the Reich Health Leader in Nazi Germany\nRomano Amerio (1905\u20131997) a Roman Catholic theologian\nNiccol\u00f2 Tucci (1908\u20131999) a short story writer and novelist who wrote in English and Italian\nLauro Amad\u00f2 (1912\u20131971) also known as Lajo, a Swiss football player, played 54 games for the Swiss national football team\nMario Agliati (1922\u20132011) a Swiss-Italian journalist, writer and historian\nMario Comensoli (1922\u20131993) a Swiss painter of the realist movement\nSergio Mantegazza (born 1927) a Swiss-Italian businessman, chairman and owner of Globus a multinational travel company.\nDuilio Arigoni (born 1928) a Swiss chemist, works on the biosynthetic pathways of many organic natural substances\nTito Tettamanti (born 1930) a Swiss lawyer, politician, and entrepreneur\nPietro Balestra (1935\u20132005) a Swiss economist specializing in econometrics\nFranco Ambrosetti (born 1941) a jazz trumpeter, flugelhornist and composer \nChristian Giordano (born 1945) a Swiss anthropologist and sociologist\nGiorgio Giudici (born 1945) a Swiss architect and politician, Mayor of Lugano 1984\u20132013\nRomolo Nottaris (born 1946) a Swiss rock climber, mountaineer and author of documentary films\nChiara Banchini (born 1946) Swiss Baroque violinist \nGeorg Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza (born 1950), manager\nLuca Pianca (born 1958) a Swiss musician-lutenist whose specialty is archlute \nDiego Fasolis (born 1958) a Swiss classical organist and conductor \nMarco Borradori (born 1959) a Swiss lawyer and politician, Mayor of Lugano since 2013\nMauro Gianetti (born 1964) a Swiss directeur sportif, former professional rider\nGianluca Barilari (born 1964) head coach of the Swiss national basketball team\nCarlo Bonzanigo (born 1966) an Italian and Swiss car designer, works for Pininfarina and for Citroen Design.\nHardy Kr\u00fcger junior (born 1968), German actor \nAntonio Esposito (born 1972) is Swiss-Italian former footballer, 320 games\nChristian Rebecchi (born 1980) a Swiss painter and sculptor of the NEVERCREW artists duo\nAlberto Regazzoni (born 1983) a footballer, over 440 games and 3 for the national side\n\n\n=== People who lived or died in Lugano ===\n\n19th CMikhail Bakunin (1814\u20131876) a Russian revolutionary anarchist and founder of collectivist anarchism\nEnrico Bignami (1844\u20131921) an Italian merchant and editor of La Plebe, a socialist newspaper\nFerdinando Fontana (1850\u20131919) an Italian journalist, dramatist, poet and committed, passionate socialist\nHans Kundt (1869\u20131939) a German military officer, the primary military figure of Bolivia\nHeinrich Thyssen (1875\u20131947) a German-Hungarian entrepreneur and art collector\nHermann Hesse (1877\u20131962), author and philosopher, won the Nobel Prize in 1946\nJurgis \u0160aulys (1879\u20131948) a Lithuanian economist, diplomat and politician;

        "wiki": "Lugano Cathedral (Italian: Cattedrale di San Lorenzo) is a Roman Catholic cathedral dedicated to Saint Lawrence in Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland. It was founded in the High Middle Ages but rebuilt in the late 15th century, with the fa\u00e7ade completed in 1517. It is the seat of the Bishop of Lugano.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church is known on this site from 818. In 1078 it was made a collegiate church, becoming a cathedral in 1888. The original Romanesque building was oriented the opposite way to the present church, as is shown by remains of the apse discovered under the current parvise. In the 15th century the church was expanded and the entrance moved to the present position, while the open roof was covered by a groin vaulted ceiling.\nThere were extensive renovations in 1905-1910, when some Baroque chapels were demolished and the interior received frescoes by Ernesto Rusca.\n\n\n== Architectural details ==\nThe church's main feature is its facade, which was inspired by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo's Certosa di Pavia. It is made of white stone from Saltrio and Viggi\u00f9 and of Carrara marble, and is divided in three sectors by four false columns supporting the entablature. In the middle sector is the main portal and a large rose window with decoration of cherubs executed after 1578. The decorations of the portals' frames are of high quality, with figures of puttoes, birds and lion-protomes. The central portal, called the \"Saints Portal\", has five medallions with reliefs, depicting four saints and, in the middle, the Virgin with Child. Between the portal's frame and the entablature are two angels carrying torches, resembling the decoration of the Roman triumphal arches.\nBetween the portals, inside square frames, are busts of the Four Evangelists and of the Kings Solomon and David. The entablature frieze has 17 figures, including biblical characters and the Sibyls. Also present are animal figures, while a restoration in 2002 showed traces of a fresco. The main portal of the Romanesque church is now moved to the sacristy.\nThe bell tower dates, in its lower part, to the Romanesque church. The two upper storey are in the Baroque style with an octagonal lantern covered by a cupola, designed by Costante Tencalla.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cattedrale di San Lorenzo (Lugano) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "The Basilica della Santa Casa (English: Basilica of the Holy House) is a shrine of Marian pilgrimage in Loreto, Italy. The basilica is known for enshrining the house in which the Blessed Virgin Mary is believed by some Catholics to have lived. A legend claims the same house was flown over by angelic beings from Nazareth to Tersatto (Trsat in Croatia), then to Recanati, before arriving at the current site.Pope Benedict XV designated the Blessed Virgin Mary under the same title to be Patroness of air passengers and auspicious travel on 24 March 1920. Accordingly, Pope Pius XI granted a Canonical Coronation to the image of Our Lady of Loreto made of Cedar of Lebanon on 5 September 1922, replacing the torched image consumed in fire on 23 February 1921.\n\n\n== The church building ==\nThe basilica is a Late Gothic structure continued by Giuliano da Maiano (1432\u20131490), Giuliano da Sangallo (1445\u20131516) and Donato Bramante (1444\u20131514). It is 93 meters long, 60 meters wide, and its campanile is 75.6 meters high.\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the church was erected under Sixtus V, who in 1586 fortified Loreto and gave it the privileges of a town; his colossal statue stands on the parvis, above the front steps, a third of the way to the left as one enters. Over the principal doorway there is a lifesize bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by Girolamo Lombardo; the three superb bronze doors executed at the latter end of the 16th century under the reign of Paul V (1605\u20131621) are also by Lombardo (1506-1590), his sons and his pupils, among them Tiburzio Vergelli (1551-1609), who also made the fine bronze font in the interior. The doors and hanging lamps are by the same artists.The richly decorated campanile (1750 to 1754), by Luigi Vanvitelli, is of great height; the principal bell, presented by Leo X in 1516, weighs 11 tons.\nThe interior of the church has mosaics by Domenichino and Guido Reni and other works of art, including statues by Raffaello da Montelupo. In the sacristies on each side of the right transept are frescoes, on the right by Melozzo da Forl\u00ec, on the left by Luca Signorelli and in both there are some fine intarsias; the basilica as a whole is thus a collaborative work by generations of architects and artists.\n\n\n== The Santa Casa ==\n\nThe main attraction of Loreto is the Holy House itself (in Italian, the Santa Casa di Loreto). It has been a Catholic pilgrimage destination since at least the 14th century and a popular tourist destination for non-Catholics as well.\n\n\n=== The \"house\" ===\nThe \"house\" itself consists of three stone walls. It is a plain stone structure, with a door on the north side and a window on the west. The size is 31 13 feet, i.e. 9 x 4 m (or 8.5 m by 3.8 m and 4.1 m high). \nThe \"house\" contains the \"Altar of the Apostles\", venerated as the authentic one built by St Peter and the Apostles.A niche contains a 33 inches high black image of the Virgin and Child, a statue made of Lebanon cedar, richly adorned with jewels, placed above the altar. A legend attributes the statue to Saint Luke, described in the Bible a physician, with a later tradition adding painting to his skills, and here given also the attribute of a sculptor; but its style suggests it was created in the 15th century.The \"Black Madonna\", known as Our Lady of Loreto, owes its dark colour to centuries of lamp smoke and is carved from Cedar of Lebanon. Much like the Holy House, it is associated with miracles. The statue was commissioned after a fire in the Santa Casa in 1921 destroyed the original madonna, and it was granted a Canonical Coronation in 1922 by Pope Pius XI. In October 2019 Pope Francis restored the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, commemorated on December 10, to the universal Roman calendar.\n\n\n=== The sculpted marble screen ===\nAround the house is a tall marble screen designed by Bramante and executed under Popes Leo X, Clement VII and Paul III, by Andrea Sansovino, Girolamo Lombardo, Bandinelli, Guglielmo della Porta and others in the baroque style. The four sides represent the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Arrival of the Santa Casa at Loreto and the Nativity of the Virgin, respectively.\n\n\n== The Hall of the Treasury ==\nThe Hall of the Treasury dates from the beginning of the 17th century. It contains votive offerings, liturgical objects and vestments. The frescoes on the vaulted ceiling are exquisite examples of late Roman Mannerism and were created in 1605-1610 by Cristoforo Roncalli, known as Pomarancio. The architectural design is finer than the details of the sculpture. The apse is decorated with 19th-century German frescoes.\n\n\n== Tradition ==\n\n\n=== In Nazareth ===\n\nLate medieval religious traditions developed suggesting that this was the house in which the Holy Family (Mary, Joseph and Jesus) had lived while in Judea at the start of the first century AD, and which was miraculously flown over to Europe by four angels just before the final expulsion of the Christian Crusaders from the Holy Land, in order to protect it from Muslim soldiers. According to this narrative, this is the Nazareth house in which Mary had been born and brought up, received the Annunciation, conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit, and had lived during the childhood of Christ.The tradition holds that after Jesus's Ascension, the house was converted into a church where the Apostles placed an altar, at which Saint Peter, considered by Catholics to be the first Pope, celebrated the first Eucharist after the Resurrection, the \"Altar of the Apostles\" inside the \"house\" being venerated as the authentic one.In 336, Empress Helena made a pilgrimage to Nazareth and allegedly directed that a basilica be erected over it, in which worship continued until the fall of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. However, there is no firm historical evidence that Helena did in fact make such an intervention.\n\n\n=== Translation to Dalmatia and Italy ===\nThe narrative further states that, threatened with destruction by Muslim soldiers, the house was miraculously carried by angels through the air and initially deposited in 1291 on a hill at Tersatto (now Trsat, a suburb of Rijeka, Croatia), where an appearance of the Virgin and numerous miraculous cures attested to its sanctity. The miraculous translation of the house is said to have been confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the governor of Dalmatia. In 1294, angels again carried it across the Adriatic Sea to the woods near Recanati (although the reasoning is not clear as to why this happened); from these woods (Latin lauretum, Italian Colle dei Lauri or from the name of its proprietress Laureta) the chapel derived the name which it still retains (Lat. sacellum glorios\u00e6 Virginis in Laureto). From this spot it was afterwards removed to the present hill in 1295, with a slight adjustment being required to fix it in its current site. It is this house that gave rise to the title Our Lady of Loreto, sometimels applied to the Virgin; the miracle is occasionally represented in religious art wherein the house is borne by an angelic host.A more detailed narrative mentions five transitions: in May 1291 from Nazareth to Tersatto, where it remained for over three years; from there to the other side of the Adriatic Sea, to Posatora (now part of Ancona) in the Marche region; after nine months to woods near Recanati in Marche; after eight months to a hill a mile away, Monte Prodo, near Loreto, where local counts petition the pope for ownership of the pilgrimage site; and finally, at the end of 1296, to the current position on the road then connecting Recanati to Porto Recanati, on public ground free of property claims.\n\n\n== Papal support ==\nBulls in favour of the Shrine at Loreto were issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1491 (although, since Sixtus IV died in 1484, either the date is erroneous, or else the pope should be Innocent VIII), and by Julius II in 1507, the last alluding to the translation of the house with some caution (ut pie creditur et fama est). While, like most miracles, the translation of the house is not a matter of faith for Catholics, nonetheless, in the late 17th century, Innocent XII appointed a missa cum officio proprio (a special mass) for the Feast of the Translation of the Holy House, which as late as the 20th century was enjoined in the Spanish Breviary as a greater double on December 10. This mass was recently restored by Pope Francis in 2019.On 4 October 2012, Benedict XVI visited the Shrine to mark the 50th anniversary of John XXIII's visit. In his visit, Benedict formally entrusted the World Synod of Bishops and the Year of Faith to the Virgin of Loreto.\n\n\n== Historicity ==\nAn authority on Loreto has summed up the controversy concerning the miraculous flight of the Holy House by writing that it has attracted \"the ridicule of one half of the world and the devotion of the other.\"\n\n\n=== Pro arguments ===\nAnalysis by Italian archaeologists and architects reached the conclusion that the Holy House\nis built of two types of limestone found in Nazareth, but not in Loreto and Marche - as is the \"Altar of the Apostles\"\nthe mortar between the stones is typical for 1st century Palestine, but not for Italy\nthe graffiti on the walls are similar and contemporary to those discovered at the Grotto of the Annunciation in Nazareth\nthe \"house\" has no foundations, stands directly on dusty ground not cleared in any way and containing snail shells, acorns and a dried walnut, and even stands atop a thorny bush\nthe three-wall \"house\" fits exactly the measurements of the foundations excavated in front of the Grotto in Nazareth, and those of the \"missing\" wall fit the Grotto, therefore:\nthe Holy House and the Grotto were originally part of the same dwelling.\nThe Holy House is placed partly on a public road connecting Recanati with Porto Recanati, its apparition forcing the magistrates of Recanati to build a diversion of the road - this makes an intentional construction at such a location look improbable\nthe survival of the three-wall structure lacking foundations and placed partly on a road, partly over a ditch, defies the laws of physics.\n\n\n=== Counter-arguments ===\n\n\n==== Translation by Angelos/Angeli family ====\nIn modern times, the Church traced the linguistic origins of the story to an aristocratic family called \"Angelos\", which were responsible for the transfer. There are 16th century bas-reliefs, which suggest that the Holy House was transported by sea. In May 1900, papal physician Giuseppe Lapponi indicated that he had read in the Vatican archives documents suggesting that the members of the noble Byzantine family named Angelos had saved the stones of the House from Muslim devastation and transported them to Loreto. In a second step, in late 1294, Nikephoros, ruler of Epirus from the Angelos family (in Italian: Niceforo Angeli), sent on the bricks to Italy as a wedding gift for his daughter who had married Prince Philip, the son of the King of Naples, in October that year. In both Greek and Latin, the family name Angelos/Angeli means \"angels\". The stones considered by researchers to be authentic are still visibly marked with Roman numerals, by scratching or with coal, which suggest that the three walls were carefully taken apart with the intention to faithfully reassemble them at another location, which actually happened. The traditional date of the miraculous translation, 12th May 1291, is compatible with the historical dates - the port city of Acre, the Crusader capital, fell six days later, theoretically allowing for the shipment of the stones, once they had been carried by cart from Nazareth to the port of Acre.Archaeological excavations were carried out in 1962-65. Among the numerous coins found underneath the building, there were two bearing the inscription \"Gui Dux Atenes\". Meant is Guy II de la Roche, the Regent of Athens from 1280 to 1287. His parents were the Frankish nobleman, William I, Duke of Athens, and Aromanian Greek princess Helena Angelina Komnene, the daughter of John Doukas, Prince of Thessaly, also known as John Angelos. Through his mother, Guy was related to the Byzantine families of the Komnenos and Doukas, Emperors of Constantinople and Epirus. Helena was Regent of the Duchy of Athens from the death of her husband in 1287 until her son's reaching the age of majority in 1294, covering the entire time span of the translation of the Holy House from Nazareth, to Epirus, to Recanati (Loreto). The presence of the two coins are proof that the Angelos family, known in Italian as Angeli and later as De Angeli, supervised the event. The law of Recanati categorically prohibited construction of any type of building on public roads, providing for its immediate demolition; only an intervention from a very high authority could have lead to a suspension of the law, as it obviously happened in the case of the House. Archaeological examination offered further proof for both the provenance of the stones from Nazareth, and for them being reassembled at Loreto, where several phases of support construction for the three-wall structure could be detected.\n\n\n==== Chronological issues and late origin ====\nThe documented history of the house can only be traced as far back as the close of the Crusades, around the 14th century. An early brief reference is made in the Italia Illustrata of Flavius Blondus (1392\u20131463), secretary to Popes Eugene IV, Nicholas V, Calixtus III and Pius II; it can be read in its entirety in the Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesi\u00e6 Lauretana historia, by a certain Teremannus, contained in the Opera Omnia (1576) of Baptista Mantuanus.\nAccording to Herbert Thurston, in some respects the Lauretan tradition is \"beset with difficulties of the gravest kind\", which were noted in a 1906 work on the subject. There are documents which indicate that a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin already existed at Loreto in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that is, 180 years before the time of the supposed translation; and there is no mention of the supposed miraculous translation of the Holy House in 1472. Thurston notes that papal confirmations of the Loreto tradition are relatively late (the first Bull mentioning the translation is that of Julius II in 1507), but that they are at first very guarded in expression, for Julius introduces the clause \"ut pie creditur et fama est\", \"as is piously believed and reported to be\".\n\n\n==== Statue before legend theory ====\nThurston suggests that a miracle-working statue or picture of the Madonna was brought from Tersatto in Illyria (more precisely: Dalmatia) to Loreto by some pious Christians and was then confounded with the ancient rustic chapel in which it was harboured, the veneration formerly given to the statue afterwards passing to the building.\n\n\n==== Similar Walsingham legend ====\nFinally, Thurston draws comparisons to the shrine at Walsingham, the principal English shrine of the Blessed Virgin, the legend of \"Our Lady's house\" (written down about 1465, and consequently earlier than the Loreto translation tradition) supposes that in the time of St. Edward the Confessor a chapel was built at Walsingham, which exactly reproduced the dimensions of the Holy House of Nazareth. When the carpenters could not complete it upon the site that had been chosen, it was transferred and erected by angels' hands at a spot two hundred feet away.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe basilica holding the Santa Casa was built starting from 1468.In 1797, Napoleon's troops sacked the church. The treasury was emptied, either looted by soldiers, or its contents requisitioned by the pope who needed money for the payments required by the Treaty of Tolentino, which he had signed with Napoleon. Still, by 1821 the Black Madonna had been returned from the Louvre via Rome, and the treasury was again filled with valuable offerings.\n\n\n== Veneration and feast of Our Lady of Loreto ==\n\nOur Lady of Loreto is the title of the Virgin Mary with respect to the Holy House of Loreto. This name is also used her statue displayed inside the Holy House. In the 1600s a Mass and a Marian litany was approved. This \"Litany of Loreto\" is the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, one of the five litanies approved for public recitation by the Church. In 1920 Pope Benedict XV declared the Madonna of Loreto patron saint of air travellers and pilots. The statue was granted a Canonical Coronation in 1922 by Pope Pius XI. In October 2019 Pope Francis restored the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, commemorated on December 10, to the universal Roman calendar.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nDue to Our Lady of Loreto being the patroness of aviators, Charles Lindbergh took a Loreto statuette with him on his flight across the Atlantic, and Apollo 9 carried a Loreto medallion on its flight to the moon.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBasilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth\nHouse of the Virgin Mary near Ephesus\nLoreta in Prague\nLoreto Church in Warsaw\nOur Lady of Loreto and St Winefride's, Kew\nTerritorial prelature of Loreto\nGiovanni Tonucci (b. 1941), archbishop in charge of Loreto since 2007\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGrimaldi, Floriano (1984).

        "wiki": "Lugano (, also UK: , Italian: [lu\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0no]; Ticinese: Lugan [ly\u02c8\u0261\u00e3\u02d0]) is a town and a municipality in southern Switzerland in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino bordering Italy. Being the largest city in Ticino, Lugano is also the biggest Italian-speaking urban area in Switzerland. \nThe between 2004 and 2013 territorially vastly expanded municipality has a population (as of December 2018) of 63,185, and an urban agglomeration of over 150,000. The ninth largest Swiss town, it is the largest in Ticino and largest with an Italian speaking majority outside of Italy. The town lies on Lake Lugano, surrounded by the mountains of the Lugano Prealps.\nThe eastern part of the municipality shares a border with Italy.\n\n\n== Name and coat of arms ==\nThe toponym is first recorded in 804, in the form Luanasco, in 874 as Luano, and from 1189 as Lugano.\nGerman-language variants of the name (now no longer in use) were Lowens, Lauis, Lauwis, Louwerz.\nThe local Lombard form of the name is rendered Lugan.\nThe etymology of the name is uncertain, suggestions include derivation from Latin lucus (\"grove\"), from a vulgar Latin lakvannus (\"lake-dweller\") and from the god Lugus.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nThe shores of Lake Lugano have been inhabited since the Stone Age. Within the modern town limits (Breganzona, Castagnola, Davesco and Gandria) a number of ground stones or quern-stones have been found. In the area surrounding Lugano, items from the Copper Age and the Iron Age have been found. There are Etruscan monuments at Davesco-Soragno (5th to 2nd century BC), Pregassona (3rd to 2nd century BC), and Viganello (3rd to 2nd century BC). Graves with jewelry and household items have been found in Aldesago, Davesco, Pazzallo and Pregassona along with Celtic money in Viganello.\nThe region around Lake Lugano was settled by the Romans by the 1st century BC. There was an important Roman town north of Lugano at Bioggio. There are fewer traces of the Romans in Lugano, but several inscriptions, graves and coins indicate that some Romans lived in what would become Lugano.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Lugano ===\nThe first written mention of a settlement at Lugano can be found in documents, which are of disputed authenticity, with which the Longobard king Liutprand ceded various assets located in Lugano to the Church of Saint Carpophorus in Como in 724. Other documents, dating from 804 and 844 refer to Lake Lugano as Laco Luanasco, and an act of 984 indicates Lugano as a market town.During the fighting between Guelphs and Ghibellines and the new disputes between Como and Milan, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Lugano was the scene of clashes between opposing forces. After a long rule by the Rusca family, Lugano was freed from the domination of Como, which had been taken over in 1335 by the Visconti. At the same time the link between town and the valley strengthened. By 1405\u201306 documents attest to a vallis comunitas Lugani et, a governing body that was independent of Como. The new community included the parishes of Lugano, Agno, Riva San Vitale and Capriasca. In 1416 the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, conquered the region of Lugano and the Rusca valley and made it a fief. A year later, Lugano's freedoms were first documented in a series of statutes modeled on those of Como. The town was able to secure complete independence.\n\n\n=== Lugano during the Renaissance and Enlightenment ===\nBetween 1433 and 1438 the Duke of Milan, Aloisio Sanseverino sat as a feudal lord over Lugano. He compensated the Rusca family with the ownership of Locarno. Under the reign of his heirs in the following decades rebellions and riots broke out, which lasted until the French invasion of 1499.\n\nIt was the object of continuous disputes between the Dukes of Como and Milan until it became a Swiss dominion in 1513. Swiss control lasted until 1798 when Napoleon conquered the Old Swiss Confederation and created the Helvetic Republic.\nIn 1746, the Agnelli brothers opened the first printing press and bookshop in Lugano. They began publishing the newspaper Nuove di diverse corti e paesi in 1748 and changed its name to Gazzetta di Lugano in 1797. The newspaper was widely read in north and central Italy. It supported the cause of the later Jansenists against the Jesuits and therefore was banned in 1768 in the territory of the Papal States. It was open to the themes of enlightened reform and the American Revolutionary War. It was the first newspaper in the Italian language to publish an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence of 1776. After the death of Abbot Gian Battista Agnelli in 1788, who had been the editor for more than 40 years, Abbot Giuseppe Lodovico Maria Vanelli took over the paper. Under Abbot Vanelli, it supported the revolutionary ideas from France, which drew protests from the Austrian government in Lombardy. The publication of the magazine ceased abruptly after edition number 17 of 29 April 1799, following the anti-French riots in Lugano during which the Agnelli printing house was sacked and Abbot Vanelli was shot.Under the Helvetic Republic, Lugano became the capital of the Canton of Lugano.\n\n\n=== Canton of Lugano ===\n\nThe canton of Lugano unified the former Landvogteien of Lugano, Mendrisio, Locarno and Valmaggia. However, as with the other cantons of the Helvetic Republic, the autonomy of Lugano was very limited, the republic having been founded by Napoleon in order further to centralise power in Switzerland. The canton was led by a Directory of five members, who appointed a \"national pr\u00e9fet\".The canton was deeply divided between \"patriots\" supporting the Cisalpine Republic, and traditionalist \"aristocrats\". By 1799 riots broke out in Lugano, and the second pr\u00e9fet, Francesco Capra, fled the town. Power passed to a provisional government sympathetic to the Habsburgs. However, French occupation was restored in 1800. Discontent continued and in early 1802 a revolt in Capriasca led to the autumn pronunciamento of Pian Povr\u00f2, which declared the independence of Lugano from the Helvetic client republic.\nWith the Act of Mediation, the following year, political agitation was finally quelled, as were the struggles between unionists and federalists. The canton of Lugano merged with Bellinzona creating the canton of Ticino, which endures to the present day.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter 1803, the political municipality of Lugano was created. One of the primary tasks of the new city government was to determine the division of property and authority between the patriziato and the new political municipality. Two agreements between the two organizations, in 1804 and 1810, began this process. In the second half of the 19th century, the political municipality received various properties and rights from the patriziato. Francesco Capra, the pr\u00e9fet during the Helvetic Republic, became the first mayor of Lugano from 1803 until 1813. The cantonal constitution of 1814, set Lugano, Bellinzona and Locarno as capitals of the Canton. They each served as the capital in a six-year rotation. Lugano was the capital in 1827\u201333, 1845\u201351 and 1863\u201369.In the 19th century, the city government was dominated by the Liberal Party. In 1900, slightly more than half of the seats on the city council (at the time 50 total members, but 60 members since 2004) were held by Liberals. Most of the rest of the seats were held by either Conservatives or Socialists.\nThe city government initially had eleven members, but in 1908 their number was reduced to five and in 2004 increased to seven. Throughout most of the 20th century, the Liberals held the absolute majority here as well. The rest of the municipal executive posts were held by the Conservatives, the Socialists (1944\u201348, 1976\u201380 and since 2000) and the Ticino League (since 1992).\nAround 1830 new civic and government buildings began to emerge in Lugano. The town also began to expand into the surrounding hills, along the Cassarate, and toward Molino Nuovo, Paradiso and Castagnola. In 1843\u201344 the city hall was built on the site of the Bishop's Palace (built in 1346). It housed the cantonal government in 1845\u201351 and again in 1863\u201369. Since 1890, it has housed the city government. The promenade was built in stages: first part was in the 1870s, a second in the first decade of the 20th century. In the first decades of the 19th century, the roads that connect Lugano with Bellinzona (1808\u201312), Ponte Tresa (1808\u201320) and Chiasso (1810\u201316) were built. In 1848 the first steamboat on Lake Lugano began to operate, with regular, scheduled service since 1856. The construction of the Melide causeway between Melide and Bissone in 1844\u201347 favored the development of the Chiasso-Bellinzona-Lugano-Gotthard line at the expense of the north\u2013south route along Lake Maggiore. This tendency for development was strengthened further in 1882 with the completion of the Gotthard railway line. The railway station was built in 1874\u201377 in Lugano, and transformed it into one of the main links between northern Italy and central and northern Europe, which led to the development of tourism and in general helped the services sector.\n\n\n=== Modern Lugano ===\n\nFrom the mid-19th century to 1970 the town recorded constant population growth, especially between 1880 and 1910, when the population more than doubled. This increase was partly due to foreign nationals settling in Lugano (in 1870 18.7% of the population, 1910 43.6%) and people from other language areas of Switzerland (1870 1.4% of the population, 1910 6.9%). In the last three decades of the 20th century, the population fell slightly, despite the merger in 1972, of the municipalities of Castagnola and Br\u00e8-Aldesago. This reflected a trend to move away from the town to the suburban communities.However, in 2004 the municipalities of Breganzona, Cureggia, Davesco-Soragno, Gandria, Pambio-Noranco, Pazzallo, Pregassona and Viganello were incorporated into the municipality. In 2008, they were followed by Barbengo, Carabbia and Villa Luganese. This, among other factors, resulted in a doubling of the population to 52,059 in 2006, of which over a third were foreigners. In 2013 the municipalities of Bogno, Cadro, Carona, Certara, Cimadera, Sonvico and Val Colla were incorporated into the municipality.\nFollowing the Second World War, and particularly during the 1960s and 70s, thanks to an abundant flow of capital from nearby Italy, Lugano was the first host-city of the 1956 Eurovision Song Contest. Lugano experienced a period of exponential growth in banking activities which led to it placing itself as the third financial centre of Switzerland, with over 100 banking institutions present in the town. Trade, tourism and finance are the mainstays of the local economy. In 2000, nine-tenths of the workers were employed in the services sector, of which three-quarters are commuters, including many cross-border commuters (13% of the working population).\nIn 1975, the Congress Center was built followed in 1978 by the new City Hospital. In 1963 the town acquired the land for the airfield Lugano-Agno, and the first scheduled flights was in 1980. At the beginning of the 21st century they began the Grande Lugano projects, including: the car tunnel Vedeggio-Cassarate, which started in 2005 and connects the A2 motorway with the neighborhood of Cornaredo, the creation of a new Kulturpol on the site of the former Grand H\u00f4tel Palace and a convention and exhibition center in the area of Campo Marzio.In June 2011, officials of the Israeli town of Yehud announced they would undertake a massive construction project to replicate Lugano's old square in the center of their town, to reinvigorate commerce and tourism. The replica will be replete with neoclassical columns and colonnades.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topology ===\n\nThe municipality Lugano lies at the edge of Lake Lugano (Italian: Lago di Lugano or Ceresio), which is situated between the lakes Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como, south of the Alps. It lies at the heart of the Sottoceneri, that part of the canton of Ticino that lies south of the Monte Ceneri Pass.The town centre is located on the lake shore just to the west of where the river Cassarate enters the lake. The town's waterfront forms a crescent around the bay between the Br\u00e8 (925 m [3,035 ft]) and the San Salvatore (912 m [2,992 ft]) mountains.Because of the historical development of the town, incorporating some relatively distant suburbs but leaving other, nearer, suburbs as independent municipalities, the borders of the town are disparate. A large and sparsely populated section of the town is on the east bank of Lake Lugano and separated from the town by that lake. Similarly, the inner-urban but independent municipality of Paradiso is a near-enclave, totally surrounded as it is by the municipality and the Lake Lugano.Based on the 1997 land survey, as of 2013 the municipality Lugano has a total area of 32.09 square kilometers (12.39 sq mi). Of this area, 3.25 km2 (1.25 sq mi) or 10.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 6.73 km2 (2.60 sq mi) or 21.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 4.48 km2 (1.73 sq mi) or 14.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.04 km2 (9.9 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.12 km2 (30 acres) or 0.4% is unproductive land.Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 9.4% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.0%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 1.2%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 0.5% is used for growing crops and 9.4% is used for alpine pastures. Almost all the water in the municipality is in lakes.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLugano has a rare humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) for the latitude, closely bordering on a subtropical oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) due to the warmer average being 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Although the US National Academy of Sciences considers a sea-like climate, the vegetation is from the subtropics with deciduous forest. It is characterized by relatively mild winters and warm humid summers.  It has an average of 98.1 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,559 mm (61.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which Lugano receives an average of 196 mm (7.7 in) of rain, while the driest month of the year is February with an average of 52 mm (2.0 in) of precipitation over 4.6 days.Located on a plains in southern Switzerland and protected by the Alps and lakes, the climate is one of the mildest in the country, most similar to northern Italy. In addition, the precipitation is lower than in many other places as well as the deviations of temperature. Lugano is also one of the sunniest Swiss cities. The greatest precipitates anticipate and succeed much of the summer. Winter freezing temperatures are more common on the night of January (between 27 and 28 days), but the low temperatures remains are rare and do not occur every year. Much of the summer is pleasant, but warm days above of the 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) are not uncommon (average of about 8 days).The highest temperature recorded in Lugano is 38.0 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), recorded in July 1945, whilst the lowest temperature recorded being \u221214.0 \u00b0C (6.8 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929.\n\nabout 8.64% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, a cross throughout argent, between the upper case serif letters L, V, G and A (respectively in the I, II, III and IV quarters). The coat of arms dates from around 1200. The four letters on the coat of arms are an abbreviation of the name Lugano.\n\n\n=== Quarters and circles ===\nThe municipality is subdivided into 25 quartieri (quarters) which are grouped into three (cantonal) circles.Quarters 1\u20139 are the older quarters of the town, which have been added to by successive enlargements of the municipality in 2004, 2008 and 2013; these enlargements involved previously independent municipalities becoming parts of the municipality.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== Local councils ====\nIn the 2007 Grand Council of Ticino election, there were a total of 27,557 registered voters in Lugano, of which 15,214 or 55.2% voted. 237 blank ballots and 38 null ballots were cast, leaving 14,939 valid ballots in the election. The most popular party was the PLR which received 3,680 or 24.6% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were; the Lega (with 2,854 or 19.1%), the SSI (with 2,532 or 16.9%) and the PS (with 2,170 or 14.5%).In the 2007 Council of State of Ticino election, 158 blank ballots and 79 null ballots were cast, leaving 14,980 valid ballots in the election. The most popular party was the Lega which received 3,839 or 25.6% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were; the PLR (with 3,596 or 24.0%), the PS (with 2,496 or 16.7%) and the SSI (with 2,169 or 14.5%).\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the Lega which received 20.6% (-5.8) of the vote. The next five most popular parties were the PLR (20.3%, -2), the PPD (14.0%, -1.1), PS (13.9%, -1.3), the UDC (13.2%, -0.2), and the Green Party (11.1%, +7.0). In the federal election a total of 15,639 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 46.6%.\nIn the 2007 federal election the most popular party was the PLR which received 26.6% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the Lega (19%), the PPD (18.71%) and the PS (17.46%). In the federal election, a total of 11,980 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 42.8%.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince its union with some surrounding municipalities in 2004 (Breganzona, Cureggia, Davesco-Soragno, Gandria, Pambio-Noranco, Pazzallo, Pregassona and Viganello), 2008 (Barbengo, Carabbia and Villa Luganese) and 2013 (Bogno, Cadro, Carona, Certara, Cimadera, Sonvico and Val Colla), Lugano has a population (as of December 2018) of 63,185 and is therefore canton's largest town. The expansion in 2004 was the second major expansion after the union in 1972 with the municipalities of Br\u00e8-Aldesago and Castagnola. As of 2015, 38.1% of the population do not hold Swiss citizenship and 14,778 or 23.2% of the population was born in Italy.  In 2013, among the Swiss population (61.6%, 41,392), 24.3% (16,349) are Luganesi, 21.7% (14,585) from anywhere else in the canton of Ticino, and 15.6% (10,458) from other cantons in Switzerland.\nThe town's economy provides an estimated 38,000 jobs, over a third of which are occupied by cross-border commuters. Business, tourism and finance constitute the backbone of the local economy. In 2000, the tertiary sector offered 90% of all jobs in Lugano, of which 75% were occupied by commuters, many of which commute from neighbouring Italy (approximately 13% of the active working population); in the same year tax revenues reached CHF 104 million, of which CHF 59 million were attributable to the banking sector. The town is Switzerland's third largest banking centre after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva. With regards to intercommunal financial equalisation, thanks to its financial strength Lugano contributes significantly to the equalisation fund. The population is Italian-speaking and mainly Roman Catholic.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2007, the population changed at a rate of 6.9%. Most of the population (as of 2000) speaks Italian (80.3%), with German being second most common (7.1%) and Serbo-Croatian being third (2.7%). Of the Swiss national languages (as of 2000), 20,998 people speak Italian, 1,855 speak German, 597 people speak French, and 39 people speak Romansh.

Its Palm Express service connects Lugano railway station to St. Moritz. Other AutoPostale buses operate from an underground bus station and ticket office, located at Via Balestra 4 in the centre of Lugano.ASF Autolinee, an Italian bus company, operates an international bus route from Lugano to Menaggio, on the shores of Lake Como.\n\n\n=== Shipping ===\nBoats of the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano provide services on Lake Lugano. Whilst these are principally provided for tourist purposes, they also connect Lugano with other lakeside communities. Several of the landing points are within the sparsely populated section of the municipality that lies on the east side of lake, and have no road access.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nLugano hosts the Swiss National Sound Archives, responsible for safeguarding the sound heritage of Switzerland.\nThe Palazzo dei Congressi is the performing arts center for Lugano.

It focuses on art of the cantons of Ticino and Graub\u00fcnden (Grigioni in Italian) and present artists from the region on a regular basis.The district of Br\u00e8-Aldesago offers its visitors charming corners created by its characteristic stone buildings.

        "wiki": "Lake Lugano (Italian: Lago di Lugano or Ceresio, from Latin: Ceresius lacus; Lombard: Lagh de Lugan; German: Luganersee) is a glacial lake which  is situated on the border between southern Switzerland and Northern Italy. The lake, named after the city of Lugano, is situated between Lake Como and Lago Maggiore. It was cited for the first time by Gregory of Tours  in 590 with the name Ceresio, a name which is said to have derived from the Latin word cerasus, meaning cherry, and refers to the abundance of cherry trees which at one time adorned the shores of the lake. The lake appears in documents in 804 under the name Laco Luanasco.\n\nWell-known mountains and tourist destinations on the shores of the lake are Monte Br\u00e8 to the east, Monte San Salvatore west of Lugano, and Monte Generoso on the south-east shore. The World Heritage Site Monte San Giorgio is situated south of the lake.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first certain testimony of a political body governing the shores of the lake is from 818. Occupying an area of strategic importance, the lake was then part of the feudal dominion of the County of Sperio. Circa 1000, it came under the control of the Bishop of Como. The region was the site of the war between Como and Milan over control of Alpine traffic from 1218 to 1227. As the lake and its shores became progressively incorporated into the Duchy of Milan they became the subject of political and territorial contention during the 15th century, and Lugano became the lake's main town.The lake definitively ceased to belong to a single sovereign political entity following the establishment of the transalpine bailiwicks of the Swiss cantons at the beginning of the 16th century. The Italian-Swiss border was fixed in 1752 by the Treaty of Varese, and has since remained virtually unchanged.In 1848, the Melide causeway was built on a moraine between Melide and Bissone, in order to carry a road across the lake and provide a direct connection between Lugano and Chiasso. Today the causeway also carries the Gotthard railway and the A2 motorway.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe lake is 48.7 km2 (18.8 sq mi) in size, 63% of which is in Switzerland and 37% in Italy, has an average width of roughly 1 km (0.62 mi), a maximum depth of 288 m (945 ft) found in the northern basin. The culminating point of the lake's drainage basin is the Pizzo di Gino summit in the Lugano Prealps (2,245 m, 7,365 ft). Bathing in the lake is allowed at any of the 50 or so bathing establishments located along the Swiss shores.The Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia and parts of the waters of the lake are considered by European Customs Law as non-territorial for fiscal purposes and as such enjoy a special tax status as a duty-free area, exemption from EU VAT\n\nand offer residents other advantageous tax privileges.\nThe Melide causeway separates the northern (27.5 km2, 10.6 sq mi) and southern (21.4 km2, 8.3 sq mi) basins, although a bridge in the causeway permits water flow and navigation. The lake retention time is an average of 8.2 years; that of the northern basin (11.9 years) is considerably higher than the southern one (2.3 years).\nPlaces on the lake in Switzerland (CH) and in Italy (I) include (from Lugano, clockwise):\n\n\n== Navigation ==\n\nThe lake is navigable, and used by a considerable number of private vessels. Passenger boats of the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) provide services on the lake, principally for tourist purposes, but also connecting Lugano with other lakeside communities, some of which have no road access.\nFishery in the lake (and Lake Maggiore) is regulated by a 1986 agreement between Switzerland and Italy. The current agreement on navigation dates from 1992.\n\n\n== Pollution ==\nPollution has long been a problem in Lake Lugano. In the 1960s and 1970s it was officially forbidden to bathe in the lake. Despite the continued introduction of sewage treatment plants such as in Gandria, factors such as lake retention time and lack of oxygen and increasing phosphorus concentrations means it is unclear if the lake will recover.\nThe Federal Office for the Environment's last published report on Lake Lugano dates from 1995. To summarise that report:\n\nat that time measurements indicated some improvement, but this was unlikely to continue at the same pace\nthere were almost permanent polluted layers at the bottom of the very deep lake\noxygen was scarce and could not be found below 100 m (330 ft) depth\nas a result phosphorus levels were increasing at this depth\nphosphorus levels in the northern basin were six times too high and in the southern basin twice too high\nwill take many decades to clean\nthe lake could be said to be \"chronically sick\"\nin the Italian part of the lake only 20% of the population were connected to sewage treatment plants with phosphorus filters (not that all Swiss areas were connected either).The Swiss-Italian organisation CIPAIS in its most recent published report says:\n\nConsidering the results obtained in 2009 it can be affirmed that, notwithstanding the observed improvement, Lake Lugano is still in a state of high eutrophication, the  highest among Swiss lakes.\nThe Italian environmental group Legambiente, in its 2007 study of all northern Italian lakes, found Lake Lugano to be the most polluted of all.\n\nAll water samples were well beyond the legal limits. The polluted sites should not be bathed in for health reasons. Bacteria can cause in the worst case, skin infections, diarrhoea and vomiting.\nAccording to Legambiente, the only reason swimming was not banned on the Italian Lakes was because the state of Lombardy changed the law. They state that pollution levels in the lakes do not conform to European rulings and the lack of sewage treatment is illegal.\nTheir 2010 measurements found samples taken at Ponte Tresa, Ostene and Port Ceresio to be \"heavily polluted\" (more than 1,000 UFC/100 ml intestinal enterococci and/or greater than 2000 UFC/100 ml E. coli).\n\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThe lake is full of fish. Apart from a few protected areas, such as the mouth of the River Cuccio in Porlezza, fishing is allowed anywhere, although according to various regulations. Protected species are the bleak and the white clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes). The bleak is almost extinct here, unlike in Lago Maggiore, and planning is under way for the controlled repopulation of the lake, particularly around Ponte Tresa.\nIn 1895 the brook trout was introduced from Lake Zug, while between 1894 and 1897 the common whitefish was introduced. Since 1950 attempts have been made to introduce the whitefish Coregonus macrophthalmus from Lake Neuch\u00e2tel, but it has not established itself effectively.\nThe Common Roach is present in large numbers and took around ten years to colonise the entire lake, thereby replacing the bleak. Still present are the European chub, tench, carp and a few examples of European perch, largemouth bass, zander and burbot. Recently the wels catfish and pigo have been spotted.\n\n\n== Fossils ==\nThe whole area behind the southern shores of Lake Lugano is rich in fossils. The focal point of these fossil deposits is Monte San Giorgio, where since the 19th century many fossils have been found dating from the mid-Triassic (around 220 million years ago). The deposits on Monte San Giorgio stretch towards the west into Italian territory and the deposits of Besano. Fossils dating from the early Jurassic (around 180 million years ago) have also been found along the southern shores but more towards the east and Osteno.\n\n\n== Panorama ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLake Lugano Navigation Company (in Italian)\u2014Includes timetables\nLegambiente\nCIPAIS Commissione Internazionale per la Protezione delle Acque Italo-Svizzere (in Italian) limnologic reports\nLake Lugano in  German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland.\nConvenzione del 2 dicembre 1992 fra la Svizzera e l\u2019Italia per la disciplina della navigazione sul lago Maggiore e sul lago di Lugano (con R e all.)

It lies at 889 feet (271 m) above sea level, among the outer spurs of the Alps that divide the Ticino River basin from that of the Adda, and is irregular in shape, with a western arm almost cut off from the main lake. Lake Lugano\u2019s greatest length is about 22 miles (35 km), greatest width 2 miles (3 km), and maximum depth 945 feet (288 m). It is fed by numerous small mountain streams and is drained by the short Tresa River into Lake Maggiore.

        "wiki": "Lugano (, also UK: , Italian: [lu\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0no]; Ticinese: Lugan [ly\u02c8\u0261\u00e3\u02d0]) is a town and a municipality in southern Switzerland in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino bordering Italy. Being the largest city in Ticino, Lugano is also the biggest Italian-speaking urban area in Switzerland. \nThe between 2004 and 2013 territorially vastly expanded municipality has a population (as of December 2018) of 63,185, and an urban agglomeration of over 150,000. The ninth largest Swiss town, it is the largest in Ticino and largest with an Italian speaking majority outside of Italy. The town lies on Lake Lugano, surrounded by the mountains of the Lugano Prealps.\nThe eastern part of the municipality shares a border with Italy.\n\n\n== Name and coat of arms ==\nThe toponym is first recorded in 804, in the form Luanasco, in 874 as Luano, and from 1189 as Lugano.\nGerman-language variants of the name (now no longer in use) were Lowens, Lauis, Lauwis, Louwerz.\nThe local Lombard form of the name is rendered Lugan.\nThe etymology of the name is uncertain, suggestions include derivation from Latin lucus (\"grove\"), from a vulgar Latin lakvannus (\"lake-dweller\") and from the god Lugus.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nThe shores of Lake Lugano have been inhabited since the Stone Age. Within the modern town limits (Breganzona, Castagnola, Davesco and Gandria) a number of ground stones or quern-stones have been found. In the area surrounding Lugano, items from the Copper Age and the Iron Age have been found. There are Etruscan monuments at Davesco-Soragno (5th to 2nd century BC), Pregassona (3rd to 2nd century BC), and Viganello (3rd to 2nd century BC). Graves with jewelry and household items have been found in Aldesago, Davesco, Pazzallo and Pregassona along with Celtic money in Viganello.\nThe region around Lake Lugano was settled by the Romans by the 1st century BC. There was an important Roman town north of Lugano at Bioggio. There are fewer traces of the Romans in Lugano, but several inscriptions, graves and coins indicate that some Romans lived in what would become Lugano.\n\n\n=== Foundation of Lugano ===\nThe first written mention of a settlement at Lugano can be found in documents, which are of disputed authenticity, with which the Longobard king Liutprand ceded various assets located in Lugano to the Church of Saint Carpophorus in Como in 724. Other documents, dating from 804 and 844 refer to Lake Lugano as Laco Luanasco, and an act of 984 indicates Lugano as a market town.During the fighting between Guelphs and Ghibellines and the new disputes between Como and Milan, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Lugano was the scene of clashes between opposing forces. After a long rule by the Rusca family, Lugano was freed from the domination of Como, which had been taken over in 1335 by the Visconti. At the same time the link between town and the valley strengthened. By 1405\u201306 documents attest to a vallis comunitas Lugani et, a governing body that was independent of Como. The new community included the parishes of Lugano, Agno, Riva San Vitale and Capriasca. In 1416 the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, conquered the region of Lugano and the Rusca valley and made it a fief. A year later, Lugano's freedoms were first documented in a series of statutes modeled on those of Como. The town was able to secure complete independence.\n\n\n=== Lugano during the Renaissance and Enlightenment ===\nBetween 1433 and 1438 the Duke of Milan, Aloisio Sanseverino sat as a feudal lord over Lugano. He compensated the Rusca family with the ownership of Locarno. Under the reign of his heirs in the following decades rebellions and riots broke out, which lasted until the French invasion of 1499.\n\nIt was the object of continuous disputes between the Dukes of Como and Milan until it became a Swiss dominion in 1513. Swiss control lasted until 1798 when Napoleon conquered the Old Swiss Confederation and created the Helvetic Republic.\nIn 1746, the Agnelli brothers opened the first printing press and bookshop in Lugano. They began publishing the newspaper Nuove di diverse corti e paesi in 1748 and changed its name to Gazzetta di Lugano in 1797. The newspaper was widely read in north and central Italy. It supported the cause of the later Jansenists against the Jesuits and therefore was banned in 1768 in the territory of the Papal States. It was open to the themes of enlightened reform and the American Revolutionary War. It was the first newspaper in the Italian language to publish an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence of 1776. After the death of Abbot Gian Battista Agnelli in 1788, who had been the editor for more than 40 years, Abbot Giuseppe Lodovico Maria Vanelli took over the paper. Under Abbot Vanelli, it supported the revolutionary ideas from France, which drew protests from the Austrian government in Lombardy. The publication of the magazine ceased abruptly after edition number 17 of 29 April 1799, following the anti-French riots in Lugano during which the Agnelli printing house was sacked and Abbot Vanelli was shot.Under the Helvetic Republic, Lugano became the capital of the Canton of Lugano.\n\n\n=== Canton of Lugano ===\n\nThe canton of Lugano unified the former Landvogteien of Lugano, Mendrisio, Locarno and Valmaggia. However, as with the other cantons of the Helvetic Republic, the autonomy of Lugano was very limited, the republic having been founded by Napoleon in order further to centralise power in Switzerland. The canton was led by a Directory of five members, who appointed a \"national pr\u00e9fet\".The canton was deeply divided between \"patriots\" supporting the Cisalpine Republic, and traditionalist \"aristocrats\". By 1799 riots broke out in Lugano, and the second pr\u00e9fet, Francesco Capra, fled the town. Power passed to a provisional government sympathetic to the Habsburgs. However, French occupation was restored in 1800. Discontent continued and in early 1802 a revolt in Capriasca led to the autumn pronunciamento of Pian Povr\u00f2, which declared the independence of Lugano from the Helvetic client republic.\nWith the Act of Mediation, the following year, political agitation was finally quelled, as were the struggles between unionists and federalists. The canton of Lugano merged with Bellinzona creating the canton of Ticino, which endures to the present day.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter 1803, the political municipality of Lugano was created. One of the primary tasks of the new city government was to determine the division of property and authority between the patriziato and the new political municipality. Two agreements between the two organizations, in 1804 and 1810, began this process. In the second half of the 19th century, the political municipality received various properties and rights from the patriziato. Francesco Capra, the pr\u00e9fet during the Helvetic Republic, became the first mayor of Lugano from 1803 until 1813. The cantonal constitution of 1814, set Lugano, Bellinzona and Locarno as capitals of the Canton. They each served as the capital in a six-year rotation. Lugano was the capital in 1827\u201333, 1845\u201351 and 1863\u201369.In the 19th century, the city government was dominated by the Liberal Party. In 1900, slightly more than half of the seats on the city council (at the time 50 total members, but 60 members since 2004) were held by Liberals. Most of the rest of the seats were held by either Conservatives or Socialists.\nThe city government initially had eleven members, but in 1908 their number was reduced to five and in 2004 increased to seven. Throughout most of the 20th century, the Liberals held the absolute majority here as well. The rest of the municipal executive posts were held by the Conservatives, the Socialists (1944\u201348, 1976\u201380 and since 2000) and the Ticino League (since 1992).\nAround 1830 new civic and government buildings began to emerge in Lugano. The town also began to expand into the surrounding hills, along the Cassarate, and toward Molino Nuovo, Paradiso and Castagnola. In 1843\u201344 the city hall was built on the site of the Bishop's Palace (built in 1346). It housed the cantonal government in 1845\u201351 and again in 1863\u201369. Since 1890, it has housed the city government. The promenade was built in stages: first part was in the 1870s, a second in the first decade of the 20th century. In the first decades of the 19th century, the roads that connect Lugano with Bellinzona (1808\u201312), Ponte Tresa (1808\u201320) and Chiasso (1810\u201316) were built. In 1848 the first steamboat on Lake Lugano began to operate, with regular, scheduled service since 1856. The construction of the Melide causeway between Melide and Bissone in 1844\u201347 favored the development of the Chiasso-Bellinzona-Lugano-Gotthard line at the expense of the north\u2013south route along Lake Maggiore. This tendency for development was strengthened further in 1882 with the completion of the Gotthard railway line. The railway station was built in 1874\u201377 in Lugano, and transformed it into one of the main links between northern Italy and central and northern Europe, which led to the development of tourism and in general helped the services sector.\n\n\n=== Modern Lugano ===\n\nFrom the mid-19th century to 1970 the town recorded constant population growth, especially between 1880 and 1910, when the population more than doubled. This increase was partly due to foreign nationals settling in Lugano (in 1870 18.7% of the population, 1910 43.6%) and people from other language areas of Switzerland (1870 1.4% of the population, 1910 6.9%). In the last three decades of the 20th century, the population fell slightly, despite the merger in 1972, of the municipalities of Castagnola and Br\u00e8-Aldesago. This reflected a trend to move away from the town to the suburban communities.However, in 2004 the municipalities of Breganzona, Cureggia, Davesco-Soragno, Gandria, Pambio-Noranco, Pazzallo, Pregassona and Viganello were incorporated into the municipality. In 2008, they were followed by Barbengo, Carabbia and Villa Luganese. This, among other factors, resulted in a doubling of the population to 52,059 in 2006, of which over a third were foreigners. In 2013 the municipalities of Bogno, Cadro, Carona, Certara, Cimadera, Sonvico and Val Colla were incorporated into the municipality.\nFollowing the Second World War, and particularly during the 1960s and 70s, thanks to an abundant flow of capital from nearby Italy, Lugano was the first host-city of the 1956 Eurovision Song Contest. Lugano experienced a period of exponential growth in banking activities which led to it placing itself as the third financial centre of Switzerland, with over 100 banking institutions present in the town. Trade, tourism and finance are the mainstays of the local economy. In 2000, nine-tenths of the workers were employed in the services sector, of which three-quarters are commuters, including many cross-border commuters (13% of the working population).\nIn 1975, the Congress Center was built followed in 1978 by the new City Hospital. In 1963 the town acquired the land for the airfield Lugano-Agno, and the first scheduled flights was in 1980. At the beginning of the 21st century they began the Grande Lugano projects, including: the car tunnel Vedeggio-Cassarate, which started in 2005 and connects the A2 motorway with the neighborhood of Cornaredo, the creation of a new Kulturpol on the site of the former Grand H\u00f4tel Palace and a convention and exhibition center in the area of Campo Marzio.In June 2011, officials of the Israeli town of Yehud announced they would undertake a massive construction project to replicate Lugano's old square in the center of their town, to reinvigorate commerce and tourism. The replica will be replete with neoclassical columns and colonnades.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topology ===\n\nThe municipality Lugano lies at the edge of Lake Lugano (Italian: Lago di Lugano or Ceresio), which is situated between the lakes Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como, south of the Alps. It lies at the heart of the Sottoceneri, that part of the canton of Ticino that lies south of the Monte Ceneri Pass.The town centre is located on the lake shore just to the west of where the river Cassarate enters the lake. The town's waterfront forms a crescent around the bay between the Br\u00e8 (925 m [3,035 ft]) and the San Salvatore (912 m [2,992 ft]) mountains.Because of the historical development of the town, incorporating some relatively distant suburbs but leaving other, nearer, suburbs as independent municipalities, the borders of the town are disparate. A large and sparsely populated section of the town is on the east bank of Lake Lugano and separated from the town by that lake. Similarly, the inner-urban but independent municipality of Paradiso is a near-enclave, totally surrounded as it is by the municipality and the Lake Lugano.Based on the 1997 land survey, as of 2013 the municipality Lugano has a total area of 32.09 square kilometers (12.39 sq mi). Of this area, 3.25 km2 (1.25 sq mi) or 10.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 6.73 km2 (2.60 sq mi) or 21.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 4.48 km2 (1.73 sq mi) or 14.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.04 km2 (9.9 acres) or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and 0.12 km2 (30 acres) or 0.4% is unproductive land.Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 9.4% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.0%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 1.2%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 0.5% is used for growing crops and 9.4% is used for alpine pastures. Almost all the water in the municipality is in lakes.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLugano has a rare humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) for the latitude, closely bordering on a subtropical oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) due to the warmer average being 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Although the US National Academy of Sciences considers a sea-like climate, the vegetation is from the subtropics with deciduous forest. It is characterized by relatively mild winters and warm humid summers.  It has an average of 98.1 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives 1,559 mm (61.4 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which Lugano receives an average of 196 mm (7.7 in) of rain, while the driest month of the year is February with an average of 52 mm (2.0 in) of precipitation over 4.6 days.Located on a plains in southern Switzerland and protected by the Alps and lakes, the climate is one of the mildest in the country, most similar to northern Italy. In addition, the precipitation is lower than in many other places as well as the deviations of temperature. Lugano is also one of the sunniest Swiss cities. The greatest precipitates anticipate and succeed much of the summer. Winter freezing temperatures are more common on the night of January (between 27 and 28 days), but the low temperatures remains are rare and do not occur every year. Much of the summer is pleasant, but warm days above of the 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) are not uncommon (average of about 8 days).The highest temperature recorded in Lugano is 38.0 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), recorded in July 1945, whilst the lowest temperature recorded being \u221214.0 \u00b0C (6.8 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929.\n\nabout 8.64% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules, a cross throughout argent, between the upper case serif letters L, V, G and A (respectively in the I, II, III and IV quarters).

While there is limited service to Lugano's airport, Milan's airports are not that far away and provide access to a greater number of worldwide locations.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\nLugano's railway station is situated on the historically and concurrently important Gotthard railway line, which links northern Switzerland with Ticino and Italy. Long-distance trains of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), together with international trains of Trenitalia, connect Lugano with the cities of northern Switzerland and with southern Milan.\nSince the inauguration of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in 2016 train connections between cities in Northern Switzerland, such as Z\u00fcrich, Luzern and Basel, and cities in the south, such as Bellinzona, Lugano, and Milan got even closer \u2013 they almost entirely circumvent the Alps.\nIn the future, connections to Bellinzona and the northern Swiss cities will even further improve with the opening of the Ceneri Base Tunnel in 2020.\nA two-hourly RegionalExpress RE connects Lugano with the local towns and villages on the historic Gotthard route with the northern ones on the other side of the Ceneri, such as Bellinzona and Biasca, where the fast trains enter the world's longest railway tunnel in order to underpass the Alps, and further up through the Valle Leventina up to Airolo and through the old Gotthard Tunnel (1,151 metres (3,776 feet)) to the German-speaking northern villages in Uri as far as Erstfeld.\nLugano is also served by several lines of regional trains of the Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia (TILO) network which operate in the canton of Ticino and northern Lombardia, Italy.\nSince August 2018 TILO's S50 connects Bellinzona and Lugano with Malpensa Airport once every hour with a travel time of 1:45h from/to Lugano.The S10 service connects Lugano once every half hour with the local towns and villages on the historic Gotthard route between southern Chiasso and northern Bellinzona.The RegionalExpress RE10 connects Lugano and Chiasso with Milano Centrale railway station in addition to the international long-distance trains in order to provide a fast connection once every hour; sometimes prolonged upwards to Bellinzona and Airolo, or even Erstfeld.Additionally, the metre gauge (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in gauge) Lugano-Ponte Tresa Railway (FLP) connects Lugano as the S60 from platform 11 outside the main building with the regional Lugano Airport and Ponte Tresa.From April until mid October, the tourist oriented Gotthard Panorama Express connects Lucerne with Lugano once a day via boat on the Lake Lucerne and then per train over the historic Gotthard route through the old, 500 metres (1,600 ft) higher situated Gotthard Tunnel.Lugano is also served by three funicular railways. The Funicolare Citt\u00e0\u2013Stazione, which has recently been renewed, is a short line connecting Lugano railway station to the lower town centre at the lake, whilst the Funicolare Monte Br\u00e8 and the Funicolare Monte San Salvatore ascend nearby hills to vantage points.\nA fourth funicular, the Funicolare degli Angioli, still exists but has not operated since 1986.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nLugano is located along the A2 motorway, a part of the European route E35 which over 1,600 km (990 mi) between Amsterdam and Rome.\nThe Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL) operate frequent inner town buses throughout Lugano and some of its closer neighbours.The Autolinee Regionali Luganesi (ARL) runs buses connecting Lugano with the districts of Davesco, Sonvico and the towns of Canobbio, Lamone and Tesserete, whilst the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) runs buses to the district of Gandria and Campione d'Italia. TPL, ARL and SNL services operate from the Lugano Centro bus station.\nLonger distance buses, as well as some local buses, are operated by PostBus Switzerland, known locally as the AutoPostale. Its Palm Express service connects Lugano railway station to St. Moritz. Other AutoPostale buses operate from an underground bus station and ticket office, located at Via Balestra 4 in the centre of Lugano.ASF Autolinee, an Italian bus company, operates an international bus route from Lugano to Menaggio, on the shores of Lake Como.\n\n\n=== Shipping ===\nBoats of the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano provide services on Lake Lugano. Whilst these are principally provided for tourist purposes, they also connect Lugano with other lakeside communities. Several of the landing points are within the sparsely populated section of the municipality that lies on the east side of lake, and have no road access.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nLugano hosts the Swiss National Sound Archives, responsible for safeguarding the sound heritage of Switzerland.\nThe Palazzo dei Congressi is the performing arts center for Lugano. It is a main venue for the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana.\n\nThe Blues-to-Bop Festival arrives in late August and early September turns the town into a hive of activity as thousands crowd the streets and piazzas for free open-air concerts.\nIn 1956, the Teatro Kursaal in Lugano hosted the first Eurovision Song Contest.The MASI (Museo d'Arte della Svizzera italiana) has two parallel objectives: the conservation and study of the Museum's permanent collection, which is above all made up of works belonging to the 19th and 20th centuries; and the planning and presentation of temporary exhibitions. It focuses on art of the cantons of Ticino and Graub\u00fcnden (Grigioni in Italian) and present artists from the region on a regular basis.The district of Br\u00e8-Aldesago offers its visitors charming corners created by its characteristic stone buildings. The cobble stone streets of the town offer art enthusiasts an artistic path that is very interesting both because of the presence of national and international \"names\" and the combination of art and the environment.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nHockey Club Lugano (HCL) plays in the National League (NL). They play at the Resega arena and have won seven national titles, having participated twice in the European Cup final round and once in the top four final in Euroleague. In 1991, Lugano reached the final of the famous Spengler Cup and twice reached third place in the IIHF Continental Cup Superfinal.FC Lugano plays in the Swiss Super League. They play at the Stadio Cornaredo and won the Swiss title in 1938, 1941 and 1949 and the Swiss Cup in 1931, 1968 and 1993. \nThe Stadio Cornaredo is the largest stadium in Lugano, with space for 15,000 people. It hosted the Italy-Belgium match at the 1954 FIFA World Cup. According to some sources, Lugano is the smallest town ever to hold a World Cup match. Around the soccer field there is a gravel lane used during athletic contests and that, outside of official match and training hours, can be used by joggers free of charge.  Next to the stadium are three small training fields. There are also two artificial grass fields: one for field hockey and one for soccer. There is also a skate park next to the stadium.\nBC Lugano Tigers (former Basket Club Lugano) plays in the Swiss National League A (LNA). They play at the Elvetico gym, won the Swiss Cup in 2011 and have been Swiss LNA Champions in 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2010.Lugano annually hosts the 20-kilometre (12 mi) racewalk Gran Premio Citt\u00e0 di Lugano Memorial Albisetti and the Ladies Open Lugano, an International level WTA tennis tournament. The town hosted the 1953 and 1996 UCI Road World Championships, as well as the 18th Chess Olympiad.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== People born in Lugano ===\n\nMiddle AgesGiovanni Battista Trevano (c.1560\u20131644) an Italian-speaking architect who worked in Poland as royal architect\nFrancesco Contin (1585\u20131654) a Swiss-Italian sculptor and architect\nGiovanni Battista Discepoli (1590\u20131660) was a Swiss-Italian painter of the Baroque period\nGasparo Molo (15??-16??), goldsmith\nCarlo Giuseppe Plura (1663\u20131737) a Swiss-Italian stucco artist and sculptor\nGiovanni Maria Fontana (c.1670\u2013after 1712) an Italian-Swiss architect, worked in Russia.\nGiacomo Zanetti (c.1696\u20131735) an Italian master builder and architect\nDomenico Reina (1796\u20131843) opera a Swiss bel canto tenor and composer19th CCarlo Bossoli (1815\u20131884) a Swiss-born Italian painter and lithographer of scenes from the Risorgimento\nDomenico Giambonini (1868\u20131956) a Swiss sport shooter, bronze medallist in the 1920 Summer Olympics20th CLeonardo Conti MD (1900\u20131945) the Reich Health Leader in Nazi Germany\nRomano Amerio (1905\u20131997) a Roman Catholic theologian\nNiccol\u00f2 Tucci (1908\u20131999) a short story writer and novelist who wrote in English and Italian\nLauro Amad\u00f2 (1912\u20131971) also known as Lajo, a Swiss football player, played 54 games for the Swiss national football team\nMario Agliati (1922\u20132011) a Swiss-Italian journalist, writer and historian\nMario Comensoli (1922\u20131993) a Swiss painter of the realist movement\nSergio Mantegazza (born 1927) a Swiss-Italian businessman, chairman and owner of Globus a multinational travel company.\nDuilio Arigoni (born 1928) a Swiss chemist, works on the biosynthetic pathways of many organic natural substances\nTito Tettamanti (born 1930) a Swiss lawyer, politician, and entrepreneur\nPietro Balestra (1935\u20132005) a Swiss economist specializing in econometrics\nFranco Ambrosetti (born 1941) a jazz trumpeter, flugelhornist and composer \nChristian Giordano (born 1945) a Swiss anthropologist and sociologist\nGiorgio Giudici (born 1945) a Swiss architect and politician, Mayor of Lugano 1984\u20132013\nRomolo Nottaris (born 1946) a Swiss rock climber, mountaineer and author of documentary films\nChiara Banchini (born 1946) Swiss Baroque violinist \nGeorg Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza (born 1950), manager\nLuca Pianca (born 1958) a Swiss musician-lutenist whose specialty is archlute \nDiego Fasolis (born 1958) a Swiss classical organist and conductor \nMarco Borradori (born 1959) a Swiss lawyer and politician, Mayor of Lugano since 2013\nMauro Gianetti (born 1964) a Swiss directeur sportif, former professional rider\nGianluca Barilari (born 1964) head coach of the Swiss national basketball team\nCarlo Bonzanigo (born 1966) an Italian and Swiss car designer, works for Pininfarina and for Citroen Design.\nHardy Kr\u00fcger junior (born 1968), German actor \nAntonio Esposito (born 1972) is Swiss-Italian former footballer, 320 games\nChristian Rebecchi (born 1980) a Swiss painter and sculptor of the NEVERCREW artists duo\nAlberto Regazzoni (born 1983) a footballer, over 440 games and 3 for the national side\n\n\n=== People who lived or died in Lugano ===\n\n19th CMikhail Bakunin (1814\u20131876) a Russian revolutionary anarchist and founder of collectivist anarchism\nEnrico Bignami (1844\u20131921) an Italian merchant and editor of La Plebe, a socialist newspaper\nFerdinando Fontana (1850\u20131919) an Italian journalist, dramatist, poet and committed, passionate socialist\nHans Kundt (1869\u20131939) a German military officer, the primary military figure of Bolivia\nHeinrich Thyssen (1875\u20131947) a German-Hungarian entrepreneur and art collector\nHermann Hesse (1877\u20131962), author and philosopher, won the Nobel Prize in 1946\nJurgis \u0160aulys (1879\u20131948) a Lithuanian economist, diplomat and politician;

        "wiki": "The Swiss Customs Museum, or Museo doganale svizzero, is a museum located in the Swiss canton of Ticino. The museum is sited near Cantine di Gandria, directly across the Lake Lugano from the village of Gandria, and adjacent to the border with Italy. The museum was formerly a border post on that border, but now forms part of the Swiss National Museum.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, smuggling flourished in the mountain valleys of Ticino and Graub\u00fcnden, and the museum covers the history of this, and the work of customs officers to counteract it. In a modern context, it covers the work of the Swiss Federal Customs Administration and the Swiss Border Guard.The museum has no road access, and is best reached by boat. Boats of the Societ\u00e0 Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) provide several crossings a day to Lugano.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Swiss Customs Museum at Wikimedia Commons\nSwiss Customs Museum pages on the Swiss Federal Customs Administration web site\nSwiss Customs Museum pages on the Swiss National Museum web site",

        "wiki": "Antonio del Massaro da Viterbo, or Antonio da Viterbo, nicknamed il Pastura  (c. 1450\u20131516) was an Italian painter.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nThe earliest mention of Il Pastura occurs in December 1478, when the artist participated in the establishment of Foundation of Art and University of San Luca dei Pittori, in Rome.  Il Pastura may have lived in Rome for some time before this event, although the details of his career in Rome are uncertain.  However, Il Pastura certainly participated in decorating some work by Pinturicchio in the rooms of the Borgia Apartment in the Vatican.  In Viterbo, Il Pastura painted the Presepio con i Santi Giovanni Battista e Bartolomeo (Nativity Scene with Saints John the Baptist and Bartholomew) (Museo Civico, Viterbo).\nAfter that, he traveled to Orvieto, where it is documented that between 1497 and 1499 he completed the restoration of frescoes originally painted by Ugolino di Prete Ilario for the cathedral, work which had been started by Pinturicchio.  In Orvieto Cathedral he worked on pieces that featured Biblical scenes such as the Annunciation, Visitation, Presentation to the Temple, and Flight into Egypt.  He returned to Viterbo in 1504, and painted a piece called San Terenziano, San Rocco e San Sebastiano (Saint Terence, Saint Roch, and Saint Sebastian), which was probably influenced by the work of Luca Signorelli.  It is conserved in the church of Santa Maria a Capranica.\nAfter the death of Lorenzo da Viterbo, Il Pastura became the most important Viterbese painter of the time.  He created frescoes in Viterbo such as Santi Giovanni Battista, Girolamo e Lorenzo (Saints John the Baptist, James, and Lawrence) for the baptistery of Santa Maria Nuova, which was possibly influenced by the work of Antoniazzo Romano and Perugino.  He also decorated the aedicule for the courtyard of the Chigi Palace with a Madonna and Child.  Other important works, executed between 1508 and 1509, include the decoration of the chancel of the cathedral of Tarquinia, which was commissioned by the Vitelleschi family.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe Italian scholar Italo Faldi has observed the success with critics that Il Pastura's work has enjoyed.  Even though Giorgio Vasari did not include Il Pastura's name in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, Il Pastura's reputation benefited from a resurgence of interest in his work in the 19th century.  One of the first monographs on an Italian painter was one written on Il Pastura, in 1901, by E. Steinmann.\n\n\n== Works ==\nItaly\nMadonna in trono con Bambino benedicente tra santi, Amelia, Italy\nDeposizione, Cristo in piet\u00e0 con gli strumenti della passione, Canino, church of San Francesco [1]\nSan Rocco, San Terenziano e San Sebastiano, Capranica, church of Santa Maria\nMadonna con Bambino in un paesaggio, Naples, private collection (1926)\nCoppie di angeli reggenti lo stemma del Duomo, Orvieto, Cathedral of Orvieto [2]\nPresentazione al Tempio, Annunciazione, Visitazione, Orvieto, Cathedral of Orvieto (chancel) [3]\nMadonna con Bambino in trono, Orvieto, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo [4]\nSan Sebastiano e donatore, Orvieto, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo [5]\nAffresco con Santi, Orvieto, church of Santissima Trinit\u00e0\nMadonna con Bambino in trono tra Santi, Rome, San Cosimato\nMadonna col Bambino, Rome, Pinacoteca Capitolina [6]\nSacra Famiglia con San Giovannino in adorazione del Bambino, Rome, collezione Rospigliosi\nMadonna con Bambino tra Santi, Rome, private collection of Principe Massimo\nMadonna con Bambino benedicente, Rome, private collection\nMadonna del Latte in trono, Tarquinia, Museo Nazionale\nAffreschi, Tarquinia, cathedral\nMadonna con Bambino benedicente tra Santi, Terni, Pinacoteca comunale\nMadonna con Bambino incoronata da angeli in una mandorla di cherubini, Tuscania (VT), chiesa di Santa Maria del Riposo\nMadonna con Bambino benedicente in una mandorla di cherubini, Vercelli, Museo Borgogna (gi\u00e0 Roma, collezione principe Orsini) [7]\nAffreschi, Viterbo, Museo civico (dalla chiesa di San Domenico)\nNativit\u00e0, adorazione dei pastori con Santi, Viterbo, Museo civico\nStendardo processionale, Viterbo, Museo civico (associated with church of San Clemente)\nMadonna con Bambino in trono e angeli tra Santi, Viterbo, Museo civico (associated with church of Santa Maria del Paradiso)\nOrazione nell'orto, Viterbo, Museo civico\nEdicola affrescata, Viterbo, Palazzo Chigi (Cortile)\nSan Rocco e donatore, Viterbo, church of Sant'Angelo in Spatha\nAffresco, Viterbo, church of Santa Maria Nuova\nAffreschi votivi, Viterbo, church of Santa Maria della Peste\nFrance\nMadonna del Latte tra Santi, Grenoble, Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts [8]\nMadonna con Bambino benedicente in un paesaggio, Paris, Collection of Comte D'Hautpoul\nGermany\nMadonna in trono con Bambino, Berlin, Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum (destroyed in 1945)\nLiechtenstein\nMadonna con Bambino, due angeli e San Giovannino, Vaduz, Galleria Liechtenstein\nSwitzerland\nMadonna con Bambino, Lugano, Bruno Scardeoni Collection (1975)\nUnited States\nMorte di Cristo con Maria e San Giovanni, Atlanta, Georgia, High Museum of Art [9]\nAnnunciazione, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts [10]\nMadonna in trono con Bambino benedicente in un paesaggio, Cambridge (Massachusetts), Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University [11]\nMadonna con Bambino in trono tra Santi, Philadelphia  (Pennsylvania), Museum of Art, John G.

        "wiki": "Melide is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. The village lies very close to the mountain Monte San Salvatore and is directly on the Lake of Lugano. The Melide causeway to the east was built to make it possible to cross to Bissone and to allow a north-south highway to be built.\nMelide is known worldwide for the famous Swissminiatur, a museum that shows famous buildings in Switzerland presented in miniature form.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMelide is first mentioned in 1034 as Melede.  It was originally ruled by Como.  After ownership transferred to Milan in the first half of the 15th Century, Melide was required to furnish five soldiers for the Duke of Milan.  In 1482, a toll and customs station is first mentioned in Melide.\nUntil 1427 it was part of the parish of Lugano, followed by the parish of Carona.  It became an independent parish in 1525.  As the excavations of 1991-92 showed, the parish church of SS Quirico e Giulitta developed in several construction stages during the 6th and 7th Centuries.  It was rebuilt in 1590 by Domenico Fontana.  The S. Spirito Hospital was first mentioned in 1498 and was affiliated with Church of the S. Spirito Hospital in Rome.  It was later abandoned and demolished in 1911. The Chapel of S. Croce is from 1626.In 1555 the Swiss Confederation Tagsatzung granted Melide, Bissone and Morcote a monopoly on the sale of fish in Lugano.  Fishing, together with agriculture and viticulture was the main sources of income in the village.  The rest of the income for the village comes from the emigration of artisans and artists, including the Fontana and Castelli families.  After the construction of the main road in 1818, a ferry opened in the settlement of La Punta the following year.  The ferry helped the economic development of the village until the construction of the Melide causeway between 1844-47.  The 817 meters (2,680 ft) long structure added a railroad line in 1874 and since the second half of the 1960s, a highway.  In the 18th Century lime kilns opened in the village.  In the 19th Century various manufacturers of tobacco, alcohol, bells, boats, soap and ink opened.  The tourist industry started in the 19th Century and is still a major industry in Melide.  In 1959, Swissminiatur, with miniature models of Swiss towns and buildings, opened.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMelide has an area, as of 1997, of 1.67 square kilometers (0.64 sq mi).

          "Around 120 detailed models of houses, castles and monuments can be found out in the open in the roughly 14,000m2 park. It was very impressive to walk through Switzerland in miniature and marvel at the well-known buildings like Heidi Village, Chillon Castle or Parliament House in",
          "We went to this place with my little nephew and it was a revelation. Very well done indeed, with many places perfectly reproduced. It was nice to discover so many swiss location in one go. There is a nice restaurant on site with good choice of meals. If you travel by car, it",

          "I love the miniature theme parks, this the third that I am visiting (the other were in Israel and in the valley of Loire). I found the Swiss version well organized and maintained. I liked the fact that an itinerary could be built following the order of the numbers. The fact that",
          "I remember going there when I was about 6 or 7, which is probably the best age for kids to go there as they can ride the train (we got two free tickets when we entered the park) and the water bumper cars. It\u2019s also probably best if you know a little bit about Switzerland and its",
          "This is a nice place to go with kids or if you just want to see an overview of all of the Swiss points of interest in miniature. It\u2019s well done. I recommend lunch and a swim at Baja. Perfect family day out.",
          "I really enjoyed Swissminiatur - I think it was nice for the children to see after having toured around Switzerland to see it all in miniature. The cars, boats, trains, are very nicely done. We took the boat from Lugano and kids enjoyed the boat ride. I think unless you are",
          "Not too busy, nicely representing Suisse. A shame there wasn\u2019t a bit more information on all the buildings. As a non Suisse family we were not really in the loop what the buildings were representing",
          "I came across Swissminiatur on the internet just prior to leaving the United States for Switzerland. With a big \"THUMBS UP\" from a Swiss friend on Facebook, I added it to my trip to Lugano, as there is a nice boast ride which takes you from Lugano to Melide. It's about 35",

          "We took the 10\" Train from Lugano and walked a few minutes across the street to get here. I loved this place . Such a display of craftsmanship. So many mechanized displays such as trams, trains, fountains etc. As 2 older adults, we love this place so much that we walked around",
          "Very satisfied to see all Switzerland in one place. There are a lot to see and we took a lot of nice pictures. Worth it to go there. It is in Melide. Transport is not a problem.",
          "A very fun excursion. The park is much smaller than I imagined but we had a lovely hour or so wandering around. The models are incredible and attention to detail is superbe!",
          "Even at -3 degrees the Swiss miniature is one of Switzerland most beautiful sites to encounter. I would recommend it in any season of the year.",
          "We were staying in Melide and walked past this attraction at night and decided to go and visit the next day before leaving. The miniatures are well maintained, the park is clean and is well laid out. The layout guides you through the park and shows you the various sites around",
          "This place is very well made: nice attention to detail, all swiss ladscapes - mountains with snow, telecabins, harbour, ships moving, cave, historical buildings, and more. It is very well done and maintained. There are a few nice places for kids to play as well (a go-around",
          "that's a nice attraction especially for families with young kids, but not only. walking around the park and having the felling of being walking around whole Switzerland is an amazing experience.",
          "We visited it on a sunny day in October. We paid 18 CHF for ticket per person, which i feel is too overpriced for what we get to see. You can see the miniature creations of most of Swiss tourist places and attractions.",

          "This place is super cute but pricey for what it is. Everyone including the kids were pretty impressed on arrival but it didn't take long for it to become boring. We walked round in under one hour. The rides available for the kids (train,bumper boats and bumper cars) were very",
          "Managed to while away an hour and a half. Quite pricey for the experience. The wee ones enjoyed the model trains, boats etc but quickly bored of the buildings. After figuring out that you need to go and find the train driver at the desk the toy train was a blast for them and",
          "Have never seen anything like it before, there were 127 different scenes set out, including churches,alps,lakes,etc. Food there pricey, took lots of photos and u get a leaflet telling you what each one is. Well worth the entrance fee (better still if u r a senior citizen).",
          "Nice little place to visit. Good for children as also has bumper cars and mini train ride. Lots of miniature detailed Swiss landmarks and buildings that are quite interesting. Not a massive place though so can do in approx 1-1.5 hours. Cost to get in was 39 euros for two adults",
          "Seriously - don't waste your $. We were all ready to leave after 5 minutes. No info on any of the buildings. If you want to learn about any of the \"sights\", you have to stop & do a Google search.",
          "The park was lovely and cute. We kept our toddler busy by trying to spot all the tiny moving trains, sky rails and buses. A little train took us around the park. The ride was however over in a few minutes. Unfortunately , as lovely and charming as the park is, there is just too",
          "We were visiting Lugano for a day trip given it was raining in Lucerne (one of the joys of having a swiss pass.. you can just hop on a train and go where the weather is better). The place has all the beautiful spots in Switzerland in miniature. The models are very realistic and",
          "I recently brought my family of four to this theme park, having visited something g similar in Tasmania a few months ago. It cost us $60 and we would need to pay extra for all four to ride the small train, number cars or bumper boats. As others mentioned, it is a small park",
          "Very well maintained miniature of all well known buildings, Monuments and castles. Fun filled activity specially for children. Live trains, very good expirience. Requires atleast 3 hours. Avoid very summy days in summers",

          "We liked this place as we went here towards the fag end of our Swiss holiday. Here we were able to see the miniatures of the places we had visited and hence served as a good summarising of our Swiss vacation. It's a small place with a lot of miniatures. The quality of the",
          "A family trip to swiss miniature from lucern was mainly aimed for children. It's a long travel from lucern around 2.5 to 3 hrs. From lucern to lugano & to melide (7-8) mins. Nicely replicated miniature mainly of many swiss famous places. Childrens loved it, for adults it's just",
          "If you don't have time to travel throughout Switzerland I guess this is the next best thing. You will see many nice buildings from every corner of Switzerland as well some beautiful trains running throughout the complex.",
          "After 8 years we visited again the swissminiature. Still a nice place to visit but since last time nothing renovated and the buildings are nit in good shape anymore. Needs urgently some renovation and freshness!",
          "Swissminiatur is a tourist mainstay of the Lugano region. The concept is what it says on the box: scale models of prominent buildings from all over Switzerland. Sadly, the models are looking a bit faded and neglected, and 50 francs for parents and one child represents low value",

          "Would not do a big journey to visit this place but if you are around and have a spare hour it's ok to visit especially with smaller children. A bit pricey though...",
          "Fun place to see several Swiss landmarks all in one place. Perfect for kids but also for newcomers to Switzerland like us. Staff puts lots of work into the detailed miniatures, well done. Fun fact: entrance on birthdays is free, just show an ID.",
          "I definitely recommend this for adults also (not only for kids). It is a nice place, an outdoor museum - big, nice and clean- and green. All the miniatures and the landscape created are amazing.Very well made, painstakingly worked.Take your time to see it ! it worth ! There",
          "We were in the Lugano area and saw this on TripAdvisor, so decided to check it out. Our kids (7 and 5) loved it! Their is great detail in the models with many moving parts, interactions, making you think you are looking at villages in action. Also, they had a bubbles",
          "Located at about 8 Km driving distance from Lugano through very accessible roads. It is nice to visit but you can save your time if your itinerary is already packed out. The adult ticket costs CHF 19, which I find a bit over priced similar to the entry fees to the vast majority",
          "Before my trip to Switzerland and Italy I was scrolling online and came across the Swissminiatur exhibit and put it on my to do list. I went with friends and we had such a great time. I was in awe of the amount of accuracy and detail they but into each miniature. It was easy to",
          "My wife and I visited Lugano on an overcast, rainy weekend. Our hotel package include the entrance fee to the Swissminiatur. If not for that we probably wouldn't have gone there, but we were very pleasantly surprised. This place is definitely worth a visit! The detail of the",

          "Wonderful highlights of Switzerland, most of which are very well made. Unfortunately, due to being exposed to the elements wear and tear is quite evident and many exhibits require restoration. Probably for this reason the price is also quite high. It was rather hard to find a",
          "We were so awed by the masterpiece, it is truly amazing how masters can capture the tiny little statues and all the details so skillfully. I highly recommend visiting the place as nothing will compare, in my opinion. It's the entire large territory that you have to walk through",
          "I was here many years ago as a child, and remembered the place as very interesting. Now, as an adult, I'm still impressed. The amazingly intricate work, that goes into the construction of these miniature buildings is absolutely amazing. It's definitely worth a couple of hours,",
          "If you are foreigner or even Swiss, I would strongly recommend to visit once in your life time this touristic site which offers a great summary of Switzerland's main attractions.",

          "We were returning to Bellagio, Como from Milan. Oli suggested we visit it. Since it was a short run for us, we did take the time out from our FoxTown outlets (just as well), and made it. All in all a worthwhile educational visit for all. A lot of effort and thought has gone",
          "I was excited to take my family to the Swissminiatur in Melide, where I had been several times as a child myself. And the kids really loved it, loved seeing the trains going back and forth and all around! However, unfortunately, the whole structure mostly looked the same as it",
          "For the price you pay, the park could spend more money on an upgrade and repaint. Kids were more interested in the trains but that's not the parks fault. It just feels and looks cheap wiyh things stored away in plain view (inside titlus mountain). I would not go again for the",
          "Only for foreigners who want to see major swiss sites in miniature. But still, the price is too high for what it is. The park is ridiculouly small and pretty run-down. I saw several miniatures in such a bad state that I was ashamed for the direction of the park! The latter does",

          "All the way to MELIDE ~ LUGANO from center of the SWITZERLAND was a hectic travel of 5 hours one side. Well could explore the beautiful hills & some unexplored part of the SWISS!!! Frequency of travel is very less! Worth going for once!!!",
          "We took the boat to visit Morcote and Melide starting from Lugano and stop by at Swissminiatur. It not a cheap attraction but nothing really is in Switzerland and this place is cute, small and worthy. You can spend a lovely hours there. There's also a pic nic area if you don't",

          "Interesting and impressive to see hos many old castles and old buildings there are in Switzerland. Most families with kids enjoyes the area, but for aktive kids they will be bored after short time. There is not much for kids to do in the area, other than watch the trains, boats",
          "This big kid loved this model village. A chance to escape into the wonderful country of Switzerland with all it has to offer. Clean, well put together - a lot of thought went into the planning with moving trains, ski lifts, boats - I could go on, but please do and see it for",
          "I love Miniature parks. This one has models of different famous towns, monuments and even ski areas in Switzerland. Very cute! In addition it also has a mini train for little kids that goes around the park. Our kids are older so they enjoyed bumper cars on land and on water",

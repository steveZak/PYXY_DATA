        "wiki": "The South Bank Parklands are located at South Bank in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The parkland, on the transformed site of Brisbane's World Expo 88, was officially opened to the public on 20 June 1992.The South Bank Parklands are located on the southern bank of the Brisbane River, at South Bank, directly opposite the City. The parklands are connected to the City by the Victoria Bridge at the northern end, and to Gardens Point by the Goodwill Bridge at the southern end.\nThe parklands consist of a mixture of rainforest, water, grassed areas and plazas as well as features such as the riverfront promenade, the Streets Beach, the Grand Arbour, the Courier Mail Piazza, the Nepal Peace Pagoda, the Wheel of Brisbane, restaurants, shops and fountains. The parklands are also home to the Queensland Conservatorium.\nSouth Bank and its parklands are one of Brisbane's most important cultural precincts and they regularly host large scale festivals and events. Approximately 11,000,000 people visit South Bank Parklands each year.\n\n\n== History ==\nSouth Bank was originally a meeting place for the traditional landowners, the Turrbal and Yuggera people and, in the early 1840s it became the central focus point of early European settlement. From the 1850s, South Bank Precinct was quickly established as the business centre of Brisbane. However, this was all disrupted when the 1893 Brisbane floods forced the central business district to shift to the northern side of the river and attain higher ground. This is where the Brisbane central business district still stands today. This began the decline of South Bank, and the area became home to vaudeville theatres, derelict boarding houses, and light and heavy industry.\nThe 1970s marked the beginnings of a new era, with parkland reclaimed along the river bank, and the Queensland Cultural Centre was built which included the Queensland Art Gallery, the Queensland Museum, the Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland (today it also includes the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art).\n\nIn 1988, Brisbane held a successful World Expo 88, following which the Government intended to develop the site for commercial interests. However, a public campaign successfully lobbied for the site to be redeveloped as parkland for the enjoyment of people in Brisbane. In 1989, the South Bank Corporation, a Queensland Government statutory body, was established to oversee the development and management of the new South Bank Parklands.In 1998, a major redevelopment was announced that included the Goodwill Bridge, Grey Street, Grand Arbour and improvements to accessibility via removal of the canals and associated pathways.\n\n\n== Access and transport ==\n\n\n=== Walking ===\nThe South Bank Parklands can be accessed from South Bank via Vulture Street, Little Stanley Street and the Cultural Forecourt; from the City via the Victoria Bridge; from Gardens Point via the Goodwill Bridge; and from Kangaroo Point via the Riverwalk.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nThe South Bank Parklands are within walking distance of the Cultural Centre busway station and the South Bank busway station, as well as the South Brisbane railway station and South Bank railway station. There are three CityCat terminals on the Brisbane River, near the Victoria Bridge.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nBicycles can access the Brisbane,South Bank Parklands from South Bank via Vulture Street, Little Stanley Street and the Cultural Forecourt; from Gardens Point via the Goodwill Bridge; and from Kangaroo Point via the Riverwalk.  Bicycle racks are located at the Visitors Centre in Stanley Street Plaza, Suncorp Piazza, The Boardwalk, Clem Jones Promenade and Little Stanley Street.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== The Arbour ===\n\nThe Arbour consists of 443 curling steel columns covered in bougainvilleas which flower throughout the year. The arbour stretches for 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from Vulture Street to the Cultural Forecourt and is used as a pedestrian walkway.\n\n\n=== Courier Mail Piazza ===\nThe Courier Mail Piazza (former Suncorp Piazza) is an open-air amphitheater which is frequently used for community events. It has a seating capacity of 2,158. When not in use, the Piazza displays news and sports on two suspended screens.\n\n\n=== Wheel of Brisbane ===\n\nThe Wheel of Brisbane is a 60-metre (197 ft) tall Ferris wheel erected at the parklands in August 2008 to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of World Expo 88 and 150th Anniversary of Queensland 1859-2009. It carries 42 gondolas on a 15-minute ride with panoramic views of the South Bank Parklands, the Brisbane River, and the City.\n\n\n=== Markets ===\nThe Young Designers Market is held on the first Sunday of every month (10:00am \u2013 4:00pm), and features cutting edge garments and accessories from some of Brisbane's most talented young designers.\n\n\n=== Nepal Peace Pagoda ===\n\nThe Nepal Peace Pagoda was originally located on the Expo site and was moved to its new South Bank Parklands riverfront location at the conclusion of the Expo after a successful government and private fundraising campaign to keep the Pagoda in Brisbane. With its traditional architecture, art work and first level meditation area, it is a popular attraction.\n\n\n=== Restaurants and caf\u00e9s ===\nSouth Bank is a major dining precinct in Brisbane, and many establishments are situated inside the South Bank Parklands includes Ahmet's, Caf\u00e9 San Marco, Chez Laila, Mado, River Canteen, The Plough Inn, Timmy's, Gandhi Curry House, Wang Dynasty. Directly on Streets Beach, South Bank Surf Club was opened by celebrity chef Ben O'Donoghue, and features seafood on its menu with a laid-back attitude. Immediately adjacent is Live Fire Steak Bar, an al fresco restaurant and function space with modern d\u00e9cor and features craft beers.\n\n\n=== Streets Beach ===\n\nA major feature within the parkland is its man-made beach, which is 2,000 square metres of free-formed concrete surrounded by 4,000 cubic metres of sand. The sand surrounding the beach is sourced from the Rous Channel in Moreton Bay and every year the beach is topped up with an additional 70 tonnes to ensure that it is kept in pristine condition. Almost half of the lagoon area sits on reclaimed land that was once the Brisbane River.\nThe beach was designed by Desmond Brookes International and was constructed by Fletcher Jennings Construction and Water and Industrial Engineering. Construction commenced in February 1991 and was complete by June 1992. The lagoon contains chlorinated fresh water that is recirculated every six hours at up to 125 litres per second. Water for the beach is pumped through two large sand filters and chemically treated before being pumped back into the pools. Dredge pump and self-propelled sifting machines clean the adjoining pools.\nThe beach has received awards including the 1999 Moreton Bay region's cleanest beach in the Keep Australia Beautiful Council's Clean Beach Challenge and the 2001 Environmental Protection Agency's Keep Australia Beautiful Clean Beach Challenge, Friendliest Beach Award. The beach area comprises a lagoon with enough water to fill five Olympic swimming pools, with sand beaches, palm trees, rocky creeks and subtropical trees and exotic plantings.\nThe beach is named after the sponsor Streets Ice Cream, and was formerly known as Kodak Beach. The beach is patrolled year round by lifeguards.\n\n\n== Former Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Our World Environment ===\nOur World Environment was a walk through attraction that included a recreation of Mawson's Huts. It closed in 1994.\n\n\n=== South Ships ===\nThese were transport vessels which travelled along the canals that made up the park. They stopped operating in 1997 and the canals were removed as part the 1998 redevelopment.\n\n\n== Festivals and events ==\nThe South Bank Parklands host a number of annual cultural events and festivals including the Australia Day Festival, Riverfire and New Year's Eve celebrations. In 2009, Riverfire drew more than half a million spectators to the South Bank Parklands.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, South Bank Parklands was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \"location\".\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Parking ===\nThe Parklands Underground Carpark has more than 800 car parking spaces. Access is via Tribune Street or Glenelg Street, off Little Stanley Street.\nAnother Parking options:- Brisbane City Council King George square parking space : it is walking distance to  South Bank and parking rate is cheaper than South Bank parking space ( example : Friday after 4:30 pm 3 hours parking : South Bank $25 , King George Square :$5 flat rate)\n- BCC street parking : first 15 minutes free with registration and hourly rate\n\n\n=== Bathrooms and Showers ===\nShowers are located in Stanley Street Plaza and there are five bathroom facilities \n\n\n=== Internet Connectivity ===\nFree internet access is available from the park area by 24 X 7\nLimitations of Internet:  exceed the time limit of five hours and up to 512 kbps speed\n\n\n== Concept ==\nWhen South Bank Parklands were developed following World Expo 88, there were canals, bridges and launches. There were also a wildlife refuge called Gondwana Rainforest Sanctuary as well as a Butterfly House. In January 1998, Gondwana Rainforest Sanctuary was closed down and the animals relocated.\nThe Butterfly House was later renamed as the Butterfly and Insect House. In April 1998, the Butterfly and Insect House was renamed as South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary, with the introduction of other wildlife. In the latter half of 2005, the South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary was closed and dismantled and an office and retail store were built on the South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary's former location. Also gone from South Bank Parklands are the canals, bridges and launches. Visitors were originally able to hire golf carts to tour the grounds as well. This attraction was also phased out with Gondwana Rainforest Sanctuary and the canals.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of parks in Brisbane\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThings to do \u2014 South Bank Corporation\nMaster Plan Redevelopment \u2014 South Bank Corporation\nVisit South Bank Parklands\nDiscover the Brisbane River - CityCat Guide, Our Brisbane, Brisbane City Council (includes information about South Bank Parklands)\n20th anniversary of the opening of the South Bank Parklands - John Oxley Library Blog, State Library of Queensland",

        "wiki": "Roma Street Parkland covers 16 hectares in the centre of Brisbane, Australia.  The Roma Street Parkland is adjacent to Brisbane Transit Centre and the Roma Street railway station from which it takes its name (the park does not directly face onto Roma Street)  There is pedestrian access to the Roma Street Parkland from the Roma Street railway station, as well as from Albert Street, and from the section of the Parkland which used to be called Albert Park, in Wickham Terrace.\nThere is also a car park area, with road access from the intersection between Wickham Terrace, College Road and Gregory Terrace. Roma Street Parkland is the world's largest subtropical garden in a city centre. The parkland features a variety of themed gardens and recreational areas, with a web of pathways and boardwalks traversing cascading waterways and rocky outcrops, and also in situ artworks by 16 local artists.\n\n\n== History of Roma Street Parkland area ==\nLocal Indigenous people used the area for thousands of years conducting meetings and ceremonies.\nIn 1825 the Roma Street Parkland area was part of the original Brisbane settlement. In 1875 a railway terminal station in Roma Street was constructed as part of the Main Line railway linking Brisbane to Ipswich and Toowoomba.\nThe terminal grew to become a major goods yard for Brisbane and, between 1911 and 1934, the area was extensively redeveloped to support its increase in services. In 1920 extensive excavation, removing 554,300 cubic meters of earth, permanently altered the steep terrain creating the current day artificial escarpment and the boundary of the former Albert Park. During World War II, the terminal was vital for transporting war materials and military personnel north.\nContinuing to grow, the Roma Street railway station was redeveloped to service a metropolitan and long-distance train network. Because of limitations of the site revealed through the increasing mechanization of freight handling and the use of containers, the facility was eventually relocated to Acacia Ridge in 1991.\nIn February 1995, State Premier Wayne Goss announced the railway goods yard would be redeveloped as parkland. Construction began in 2000 with the parkland opened to the public in 2001. The project won its first award before it had opened: a commendation in the Cement and Concrete Association of Australia Streetsmart awards for the innovative concrete finishes created by the use of coloured concrete and an apparently random pattern of rough cast concrete generated by the formworkers which makes the finish appear to change through the day depending on the angle of the sun and the length of shadows cast by the detailing on the walls. The technique was created through a design and construction collaboration between project designers PARC managing contractor Abigroup and the Queensland Department of Public Works.\n\n\n== Amphitheatre ==\n\nRoma Street Parkland has an open air amphitheatre, previously called the Albert Park Amphitheatre, which had been a feature of Albert Park for a number of decades before the Roma Street Parkland was established.\nOutdoor film exhibitor, Moonlight Cinema holds a licence to operate an outdoor cinema experience within the park; offering hot food, beverages, film festivals, and many other activities during summer months annually. \nPlays are performed at the Amphitheatre by the Queensland Theatre Company, and the Queensland Shakespeare Ensemble, as well as by other theatre groups, with many plays by William Shakespeare having been performed at the amphitheatre.Other theatre productions, including orchestral concerts, have also been performed there.  One such concert, in which the music was by Johann Strauss, was called \"Strauss Beneath the Stars\", which was presented in October 1983.\nThe Lord Mayor's Christmas Carols, Brisbane's Carols by Candlelight concerts, were held at the Albert Park Amphitheatre before Riverstage was built in the City Botanic Gardens.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of parks in Brisbane\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoma Street Parkland \u2013 Official website\nRoma Street Parkland \u2013 History of Roma Street Parkland\n\"BRISBANE PARKS AND RESERVES\".

        "wiki": "The City of Brisbane is a local government area over the inner portion of the metropolitan area of Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, Australia. Respectively, the Brisbane City Council has jurisdiction over that area as the local government. Brisbane is located in the county of Stanley and is the largest city followed by Ipswich with bounds in part of the county.  Unlike LGAs in the other mainland state capitals (Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide), which are generally responsible only for the central business districts and inner neighbourhoods of those cities, the City of Brisbane administers a significant portion of the Brisbane metropolitan area, serving almost half of the population of the Brisbane Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA, formerly statistical division).  As such, it has a larger population than any other local government area in Australia. The City of Brisbane was the first Australian LGA to reach a population of more than one million. Its population is roughly equivalent to the populations of Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory combined. In 2016\u20132017, the council administers a budget of over $3 billion, by far the largest budget of any LGA in Australia.\nThe City derives from cities, towns and shires that merged in 1925. The main offices and Central Library of the Council are at 266 George Street, also known as Brisbane Square. Brisbane City Hall houses the Council Chamber, the offices of the Lord Mayor and Deputy Mayor, meeting and reception rooms and the Museum of Brisbane.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nAs of the election in 2020, the twenty-six wards, their councillors and their party affiliations were:\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\nThe City of Brisbane includes the following settlements:\n\n\n=== Inner suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 19\n\n\n=== Northern suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 48\n\n\n=== Southern suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 54\n\n\n=== Eastern suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 28\n\n\n=== Western suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 43\n\n\n=== Moreton Bay ===\n\nTotal: 5\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Government of Queensland created the City of Brisbane with a view to uniting the then Brisbane metropolitan area under a single planning and governance structure. The City of Brisbane Act 1924 received assent from the Governor on 30 October 1924. On 1 October 1925, 20 local government areas of various sizes were abolished and merged into the new city, namely:\n\nCities:\nBrisbane\nSouth Brisbane\nTowns:\nHamilton\nIthaca\nSandgate\nToowong\nWindsor\nWynnum\nShires:\nBalmoral\nBelmont\nCoorparoo\nEnoggera\nKedron\nMoggill\nSherwood\nStephens\nTaringa\nTingalpa\nToombul\nYeerongpillyThe Council also assumed responsibility for several quasi-autonomous government authorities, such as the Brisbane Tramways Trust.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe Brisbane City Council maintains the Brisbane Local Heritage Register, a list of nominated sites that satisfy the Council's heritage criteria.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe City of Brisbane is governed by the Brisbane City Council, the largest local council in Australia. The Brisbane City Council has its power divided between a Lord Mayor, a parliamentary-style council of twenty-six councillors representing single-member wards of approximately 30,000 voters (roughly equivalent in size to state electorates), and a Civic Cabinet comprising the Lord Mayor, the Deputy Mayor (drawn from the majority on Council) and the chairpersons of the seven standing committees drawn from the membership of Council. Due to the City of Brisbane's status as the country's largest LGA, the Lord Mayor is elected by the largest single-member electorate in Australia.  Like all mayors in Queensland, they hold very broad executive power.\nThe seven standing committees of Council are:\n\nCity Planning Committee\nCommunity, Arts and Lifestyle Committee\nEnvironment, Parks and Sustainability Committee\nEstablishment and Coordination Committee (Civic Cabinet)\nField Services Committee\nFinance and Administration Committee\nInfrastructure Committee\nPublic and Active Transport, Economic and Tourism Development CommitteeFollowing local government elections on 28 April 2012, the Lord Mayor and 18 councillors are members of the Liberal National Party while 7 are from the Labor Party with 1 independent.  Graham Quirk of the LNP, was elected Lord Mayor in his own right on 28 April 2012 after having been appointed to the Lord Mayoralty in April 2011 when Campbell Newman resigned to make an ultimately successful bid to become Premier of Queensland. His Deputy Mayor was Adrian Schrinner of the LNP. The day-to-day management of Council's operations is the responsibility of the chief executive officer who is currently Colin Jensen.\nElections are held every four years with ballots for the Lord Mayoralty and the individual councillors being held simultaneously. Voting is compulsory for all eligible electors. The election in March 2004 resulted in the unusual situation of Liberal (later LNP after a July 2008 merger) Lord Mayor Campbell Newman co-existing with a Labor majority on Council and a Labor Deputy Mayor, though this resulted in remarkably few conflicts over civic budgets and Council policy.  The LNP gained a 5.5% swing on the councillor votes in the March 2008 election, resulting in the Liberals taking control of the council as well (Newman won re-election with 60% of the primary vote). Graham Quirk won re-election as Lord Mayor (having been appointed to the position in April 2011) in 2012 with 61.94% of the vote and the LNP gained an additional 3 wards. The last election was held on 19 March 2016. Lord Mayor Graham Quirk defeated Labor's candidate Rod Harding.Following Quirk's resignation in March 2019, Adrian Schrinner was selected as Lord Mayor.The Brisbane City Council operates under the City of Brisbane Act 2010, while other local governments in Queensland are governed by the Local Government Act 2009.\nCouncil meetings are held at Level 2, City Hall, 64 Adelaide Street, Brisbane City every Tuesday at 2pm except during recess and holiday periods. This temporary venue is in use due to the restoration work being performed on the traditional venue Brisbane City Hall. Meetings are generally open to the public.\nBrisbane City Council aims to be carbon neutral by 2026 via the reduction of emissions and carbon offsetting.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\nThe motto of the City of Brisbane is Meliora sequimur, Latin for We aim for better things. The Council's corporate slogan is Dedicated to a better Brisbane. The City's colours are blue and gold. Its corporate logo was introduced in 1982 in preparation for the Commonwealth Games hosted in Brisbane that year. It features a stylised version of Brisbane's City Hall which opened in 1930. The City's floral emblem is the (exotic) poinsettia and its faunal emblem is the graceful tree frog.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\nBrisbane City Council operate libraries in Annerley, Ashgrove, Banyo, Bracken Ridge, Brisbane CBD (Brisbane Square), Bulimba, Carina, Carindale (Westfield Carindale), Chermside, Coopers Plains, Corinda, Everton Park, Fairfield, Upper Mount Gravatt (Garden City), Grange, Hamilton, Holland Park, Inala, Indooroopilly, Kenmore, Mitchelton, Mount Coot-tha (Botanic Gardens), Mount Gravatt, Mount Ommaney, New Farm, Nundah, Sandgate, Stones Corner, Sunnybank Hills, Toowong, West End, Wynnum, and Zillmere. In addition, it operates a mobile library service to Aspley, Bellbowrie, Brighton, Ellen Grove, Forest Lake, Manly West, Mount Crosby and The Gap. There is also a pop-up library that attends community events and festivals, as well as visiting various parks around Brisbane for children's storytime sessions (a list of dates and places is published some months in advance).\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nThe City of Brisbane has nine sister cities.\n\nNice, France was formerly a sister city of Brisbane until the relationship was severed in 1995 as protest against the Chirac government's decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean. Bangkok became a sister city of Brisbane on 7 May 1997, but is no longer listed as a sister city on the Brisbane City Council website. Brisbane does not have any sister city relationship with any North American, South American, African or any European city.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLord Mayor of Brisbane\nLocal government in Australia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nBrisbane City Council's Organisational Structure\n\"Brisbane and Greater Brisbane\".

        "wiki": "Brisbane ( (listen)) is the capital of and the most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of over 2.5 million, and the South East Queensland metropolitan region, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.6 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the historic European settlement and is situated inside a peninsula of the Brisbane River, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) from its mouth at Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges. It sprawls across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs)\u2014most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is \"Brisbanite\", whilst common nicknames include \"Brissy\", \"River City\" and \"Brisvegas\".One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the Aboriginal Turrbal and Jagera nations. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located\u2014which in turn takes its name from Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales at the time of the city's founding\u2014the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. The Moreton Bay penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 kilometres (17 mi) north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur.A diverse city with 32.2% of its metropolitan population being foreign born, Brisbane is classified as a global city, and ranks highly in ratings of liveable cities. Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city's built heritage. The city is noted for its cuisine brunches, outdoor dining, and rooftop bar scene. Brisbane was also the origin of the Anzac Day tradition through the works of Canon David John Garland. \nA transportation hub, Brisbane is served by a large suburban rail network, popular bus and ferry networks as well as Australia's third-busiest airport and seaport.\nBrisbane is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, which are home to numerous popular surf beaches, located immediately south and north of Brisbane respectively. Major landmarks and attractions include South Bank Parklands, the Queensland Cultural Centre (including the Queensland Museum, Queensland Art Gallery, Gallery of Modern Art, Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland), City Hall, the Story Bridge, the Howard Smith Wharves, ANZAC Square, St John's Cathedral, Fortitude Valley (including James Street and Chinatown), West End, the Teneriffe woolstores precinct, the Brisbane River and its Riverwalk network, the City Botanic Gardens, Roma Street Parkland, New Farm Park (including the Brisbane Powerhouse), the Kangaroo Point Cliffs and park, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the Mount Coot-tha Reserve (including Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens), the D'Aguilar Range and National Park, as well as Moreton Bay (including Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands, and coastal suburbs such as Shorncliffe, Wynnum and those on the Redcliffe Peninsula).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-19th century ===\nIndigenous Australians are believed to have lived in coastal South East Queensland for 22,000 years, with an estimated population between 6,000 and 10,000 individuals before white settlement. At this time, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Jagera people, including the Turrbal group, who knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning \"place shaped as a spike\". Archaeological evidence suggests frequent habitation around the Brisbane River, and notably at the site now known as Musgrave Park.Jagara (also known as Jagera, Yagara, and Yuggera) and Yugarabul (also known as Ugarapul and Yuggerabul) are Australian Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland.  There is some uncertainty over the status of Jagara as a language, dialect or perhaps a group or clan within the local government boundaries of Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. The languages of Greater Brisbane are related \u2013 there is uncertainty over which dialects belong to which language. The Yugarabul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Brisbane City Council, Ipswich City Council and the Scenic Rim Regional Council.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Moreton Bay area was initially explored on behalf of European colonisers by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named \"Red Cliff Point\" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay. In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.Oxley claimed, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km (12 mi) upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore. The party settled in Redcliffe on 13 September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km (17 mi) south, which offered a more reliable water supply. The newly selected Brisbane region, at the time, was plagued by mosquitos.After visiting the Redcliffe settlement, Sir Thomas Brisbane then travelled 45 km (28 mi) up the Brisbane River in December 1824. Governor Brisbane stayed overnight in a tent and often landed ashore, bestowing upon Brisbane City the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake. Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838 and the population grew strongly thereafter, with free settlers soon far outstripping the convict population. German missionaries settled at Zions Hill, Nundah as early as 1837, five years before Brisbane was officially declared a free settlement. The band consisted of ministers Christopher Eipper (1813\u20131894) and Carl Wilhelm Schmidt and lay missionaries Haussmann, Johann Gottried Wagner, Niquet, Hartenstein, Zillman, Franz, Rode, Doege and Schneider. They were allocated 260 hectares and set about establishing the mission, which became known as the German Station. Later in the 1860s many German immigrants from the Uckermark region in Prussia as well as other German regions settled in the Bethania- Beenleigh and Darling Downs areas. These immigrants were selected and assisted through immigration programs established by John Dunmore Lang and Johann Christian Heussler and were offered free passage, good wages, and selections of land.The penal settlement under the control of Captain Patrick Logan flourished with the numbers of convicts increasing dramatically from around 200 to over 1000 men. He created a substantial settlement of brick and stone buildings, complete with school and hospital. He formed additional outstations and made several important journeys of exploration. Logan is infamous for his extreme use of the cat o' nine tails on convicts. The maximum allowed limit of lashes was 50; however, Logan regularly applied sentences of 150 lashes.Free settlers entered the area over the following five years, and by the end of 1840, Robert Dixon began work on the first plan of Brisbane Town, in anticipation of future development. Queensland was separated from New South Wales by letters patent dated 6 June 1859, proclaimed by Sir George Ferguson Bowen on 10 December 1859, whereupon he became Queensland's first governor, with Brisbane chosen as its capital.In 1893, Brisbane was affected by the Black February flood, when the Brisbane River burst its banks on three occasions in February and again in June in the same year, with the city receiving more than year's rainfall during February 1893, leaving much of the city's population homeless.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nOver 20 small municipalities and shires were amalgamated in 1925 to form the City of Brisbane, governed by the Brisbane City Council. A significant year for Brisbane was 1930, with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the Shrine of Remembrance, in ANZAC Square, which has become Brisbane's main war memorial. These historic buildings, along with the Story Bridge which opened in 1940, are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city.\nDuring World War II, Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called MacArthur Central) was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to Hollandia in August 1944. MacArthur had previously rejected use of the University of Queensland complex as his headquarters, as the distinctive bends in the river at St Lucia could have aided enemy bombers. Also used as a headquarters by the American troops during World War II was the T & G Building. About one million US troops passed through Australia during the war, as the primary co-ordination point for the South West Pacific. In 1942, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.Postwar Brisbane had developed a \"big country town\" stigma, an image the city's politicians and marketers were very keen to remove. In the late 1950s, an anonymous poet known as The Brisbane Bard generated much attention on the city which helped shake this stigma. Despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The state government under Joh Bjelke-Petersen began a major program of change and urban renewal, beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs. Trams in Brisbane were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969, leaving Melbourne and one line in Adelaide as the last Australian state capitals to operate trams until Sydney begun operation of a new system in 1997.\n\nThe 1974 Brisbane flood was a major disaster which temporarily crippled the city. During this era, Brisbane grew and modernized, rapidly becoming a destination of interstate migration. Some of Brisbane's popular landmarks were lost to development in controversial circumstances, including the Bellevue Hotel in 1979 and Cloudland in 1982. Major public works included the Riverside Expressway, the Gateway Bridge, and later, the redevelopment of South Bank, starting with the Queensland Art Gallery.\nBetween 1968 and 1987, when Queensland was governed by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose government was characterised by strong social conservatism and the use of police force against demonstrators, and which ended with the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption, Brisbane developed a counterculture focussed on the University of Queensland, street marches and Brisbane punk rock music.\nBrisbane hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1988 World Exposition (known locally as World Expo 88). These events were accompanied by a scale of public expenditure, construction, and development not previously seen in the state of Queensland. Brisbane's population growth far exceeded the national average in the last two decades of the 20th century, with a high level of interstate migration from Victoria and New South Wales.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAfter three decades of record population growth, Brisbane was hit again by a major flood in January 2011. The Brisbane River did not reach the same height as the previous 1974 flood, but still caused extensive damage and disruption to the city.Brisbane also hosted major international events including the final Goodwill Games in 2001, the Rugby League World Cup Final in 2008 and again in 2017, as well as the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit.\nPopulation growth has continued to be among the highest of the Australian capital cities in the first two decades of the 21st century, and major infrastructure including the Howard Smith Wharves, Roma Street Parklands, Queens Wharf, the Brisbane Riverwalk, the Queen's Wharf casino and resort precinct, the Brisbane International Cruise Terminal, the Clem Jones, Airport Link, and Legacy Way road tunnels, and the Airport, Springfield, Redcliffe Peninsula and Cross River Rail railway lines have been completed or are under construction.\n\n\n== Geography and environment ==\n\nBrisbane is in the southeast corner of Queensland. The city is centred along the Brisbane River, and its eastern suburbs line the shores of Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea in the Pacific Ocean. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the Great Dividing Range, with the Taylor and D'Aguilar ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the Moreton Bay floodplain between the Gold and Sunshine coasts, approximately from Caboolture in the north to Beenleigh in the south, and across to Ipswich in the south west.\nThe Brisbane River is a wide tidal estuary and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are brackish and navigable. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at Moreton Bay in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the North Pine and South Pine rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the Pine River estuary at Bramble Bay, the Caboolture River further north, the Logan and Albert rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and tributaries of the Brisbane River including the Bremer River in the south-western suburbs, Breakfast Creek in the inner-north, Norman Creek in the inner-south, Oxley Creek in the south, Bulimba Creek in the inner south-east and Moggill Creek in the west. The city is on a low-lying floodplain, with the risk of flooding increased by the many suburban creeks which criss-cross the city.\nThe waters of Moreton Bay are sheltered from large swells by Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands, so whilst the bay can become rough in windy conditions, the waves at Moreton Bay beaches are generally not surfable. Unsheltered surf beaches lie on the eastern coasts of Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands islands and on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast to the north and south. The southern part of Moreton Bay also contains smaller islands such as St Helena Island, Peel Island, Coochiemudlo Island, Russell Island, Lamb Island and Macleay Island.\nThe city of Brisbane is hilly. The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the Herbert Taylor Range, such as the summit of Mount Coot-tha, reaching up to 300 m (980 ft) and the smaller Enoggera Hill. The D'Aguilar National Park, encompassing the D'Aguilar Range, bounds the north-west of Brisbane's built-up area, and contains the taller peaks of Mount Nebo, Camp Mountain, Mount Pleasant, Mount Glorious, Mount Samson and Mount Mee. Other prominent rises in Brisbane are Mount Gravatt and nearby Toohey Mountain. Mount Petrie at 170 m (560 ft) and the lower rises of Highgate Hill, Mount Ommaney, Stephens Mountain, and Whites Hill are dotted across the city.\nMuch of the rock upon which Brisbane is located is the characteristic Brisbane tuff, a form of welded ignimbrite, which is most prominently found at the Kangaroo Point Cliffs at Kangaroo Point and the New Farm Cliffs on the Petrie Bight reach of the Brisbane River. The stone was used in the construction of historical buildings such as the Commissariat Store and Cathedral of St Stephen, and the roadside kerbs in inner areas of Brisbane are still manufactured of Brisbane tuff.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\n\nBrisbane is located within the South East Queensland biogeographic region, and is home to numerous Eucalyptus varieties. Trees considered iconic to Brisbane include the Moreton Bay fig, a very large evergreen banyan with imposing buttress roots named for the region which are often lit with decorative lights in the inner city, as well as the jacaranda, a subtropical tree native to South America which line avenues and parks throughout Brisbane and bloom with purple flowers during October, referred to locally as 'jacaranda season'. Other trees common to the metropolitan area include Moreton Bay chestnut, broad-leaved paperbark, poinciana, weeping lilli pilli and Bangalow palm. Some of the banks of the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay are home to mangrove wetlands.\nBrisbane is home to numerous bird species, with common species including rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, galahs, Australian white ibises, Australian brushturkeys, Torresian crows, Australian magpies and noisy miners. Common reptiles include common garden skinks, Australian water dragons, bearded dragons and blue-tongued lizards. Common ringtail possums and flying foxes are common in parks and yards throughout the city, as are common crow butterflies, blue triangle butterflies, golden orb-weaver spiders and St Andrew's Cross spiders. The Brisbane River is home to many fish species including yellowfin bream, flathead, Australasian snapper, and bull sharks. The waters of Moreton Bay are home to dugongs, humpback whales, dolphins, mud crabs, soldier crabs, Moreton Bay bugs and numerous shellfish species.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBrisbane has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot, wet summers and moderately dry, moderately warm winters. Brisbane experiences an annual mean minimum of 16.6 \u00b0C (62 \u00b0F) and mean maximum of 26.6 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F), making it Australia's second-hottest capital city after Darwin. Seasonality is not pronounced, and average maximum temperatures of above 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) persist from October through to April.\nDue to its proximity to the Coral Sea and a warm ocean current, Brisbane's overall temperature variability is somewhat less than most Australian capitals. Summers are long, hot, and wet, but temperatures only occasionally reach 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) or more. Eighty percent of summer days record a maximum temperature of 27 to 33 \u00b0C (81 to 91 \u00b0F). Winters are short and warm, with average maximums of about 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F); maximum temperatures below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) are rare.\nThe city's highest recorded temperature was 43.2 \u00b0C (109.8 \u00b0F) on Australia Day 1940 at the Brisbane Regional Office, with the highest temperature at the current station being 41.7 \u00b0C (107.1 \u00b0F) on 22 February 2004; but temperatures above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) are uncommon. On 19 July 2007, Brisbane's temperature fell below the freezing point for the first time since records began, registering \u22120.1 \u00b0C (31.8 \u00b0F) at the airport station. The city station has never dropped below 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F), with the average coldest night during winter being around 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F), however locations in the west of the metropolitan area such as Ipswich have dropped as low as \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) with heavy ground frost.In 2009, the current Brisbane weather station recorded its hottest winter day at 35.4 \u00b0C (95.7 \u00b0F) on 24 August; however, on the penultimate day of winter, the Brisbane Regional Office station recorded a temperature of 38.3 \u00b0C (100.9 \u00b0F) on 22 September 1943. The average July day however is around 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) with sunny skies and low humidity, occasionally as high as 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F), whilst maximum temperatures below 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) are uncommon and usually associated with brief periods of cloud and winter rain. The highest minimum temperature ever recorded in Brisbane was 28.0 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F) on 29 January 1940 and again on 21 January 2017, whilst the lowest maximum temperature was 10.2 \u00b0C (50.4 \u00b0F) on 12 August 1954.Annual precipiation is ample. From November to March, thunderstorms are common over Brisbane, with the more severe events accompanied by large damaging hail stones, torrential rain and destructive winds. On an annual basis, Brisbane averages 124 clear days. Dewpoints in the summer average at around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F); the apparent temperature exceeds 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on almost all summer days. Brisbane's wettest day occurred on 21 January 1887, when 465 millimetres (18.3 in) of rain fell on the city, the highest maximum daily rainfall of Australia's capital cities. The wettest month on record was February 1893, when 1,025.9 millimetres (40.39 in) of rain fell, although in the last 30 years the record monthly rainfall has been a much lower 479.8 millimetres (18.89 in) from December 2010. Very occasionally a whole month will pass with no recorded rainfall, the last time this happened was August 1991. The city has suffered three major floods since its founding, in February 1893, January 1974 (partially a result of Cyclone Wanda), and January 2011 (partially a result of Cyclone Tasha).\nBrisbane is within the southern reaches of the tropical cyclone risk zone. Full strength tropical cyclones rarely affect Brisbane, but they do occasionally. The biggest risk is ex tropical cyclones which can cause destructive winds and flooding rains.The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from 21.0 \u00b0C (69.8 \u00b0F) in July to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in February.\n\n\n== Urban structure ==\n\nThe Brisbane central business district (CBD, colloquially referred to as 'the city') lies in a curve of the Brisbane river. The CBD covers 2.2 km2 (0.8 sq mi) and is walkable. Most central streets are named after members of the House of Hanover. Queen Street (named in honour of Queen Victoria) is Brisbane's traditional main street and contains its largest pedestrian mall, the Queen Street Mall. Streets named after female members (Adelaide, Alice, Ann, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Mary) run parallel to Queen Street and perpendicular to streets named after male members (Albert, Edward, George, and William).\nThe CBD's squares include King George Square, Post Office Square and ANZAC Square (home to the city's central war memorial).\nBrisbane's metropolitan area is broadly and colloquially divided into the 'northside' and the 'southside', with the dividing line being the Brisbane River, as crossing one of the fifteen bridges across the river is required to travel to the opposite side by land transport. This results in many areas which are south of the CBD being classified as located in the 'northside', and vice versa, as a result of the river's winding trajectory. In addition to being classified as located on the 'northside' or 'southside' there are further broad and colloquial regions such as the 'westside' for some areas to the southwest of the CBD and the 'bayside' for areas located on the coast of Moreton Bay.\nGreater Brisbane had a density of 148 inhabitants per square kilometre (380/sq mi) in 2016. Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of apartment developments, including mid-rise and high rise buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in separate houses, 12.6% lived in apartments, and 10% lived in townhouses, terrace houses, or semidetached houses.\n\n\n=== Parklands ===\n\nBrisbane's major parklands include the riverside City Botanic Gardens at Gardens Point, Roma Street Parkland, the 27-hectare Victoria Park at Spring Hill and Herston, South Bank Parklands along the river at South Bank, the Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Mount Coot-tha and the riverside New Farm Park at New Farm.\nThere are many national parks surrounding the Brisbane metropolitan area. The D'Aguilar National Park is a major national park along the northwest of the metropolitan area in the D'Aguilar Range. The Glass House Mountains National Park is located to the north of the metropolitan area in the Glass House Mountains and provides green space between the Brisbane metropolitan area and the Sunshine Coast. The Tamborine National Park at Tamborine Mountain is located in the Gold Coast hinterland to the south of the metropolitan area.\nThe eastern metropolitan area is built along the Moreton Bay Marine Park, encompassing Moreton Bay. Significant areas of Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands also covered by the Moreton Island National Park, Naree Budjong Djara National Park and the Bribie Island National Park respectively. The Boondall Wetlands in the suburb of Boondall include 1100 hectares of wetlands which are home to mangroves and shorebirds as well as walking tracks.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBrisbane has retained many heritage buildings, some of which date back to the 1820s, including The Old Windmill in Wickham Park, built by convict labour in 1824, which is the oldest surviving building in Brisbane, and the Commissariat Store on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used as a grainhouse, and is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane and contains a museum. Other 19th and early 20th-century buildings of architectural significance include the Treasury Building, City Hall, Customs House and the Land Administration Building.\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as Queenslander architecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large verandahs, gabled corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few terrace houses being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature Queenslander-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\nBrisbane is home to several of Australia's tallest buildings and it is ranked among world cities with the most skyscrapers. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. Brisbane's tallest building is currently Brisbane Skytower, which has a height of 270 metres.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBrisbane's Greater Capital City Statistical Area includes the Local Government Areas of City of Brisbane, City of Ipswich, Moreton Bay Region, Logan City and Redland City, as well as parts of Lockyer Valley Region, Scenic Rim Region and Somerset Region, which form a continuous metropolitan area. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the population of Greater Brisbane is 2,514,184 as of June 2019, making it the third largest city in Australia.\n\n\n=== Ancestry and immigration ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:\n\nThe 2016 census showed that 32.2% of Brisbane's inhabitants were born overseas and 50.9% of inhabitants had at least one parent born overseas. Brisbane has the 26th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. Of inhabitants born outside of Australia, the four most prevalent countries of birth were New Zealand, England, Mainland China, and India. Brisbane has the largest New Zealand and Taiwanese-born populations of any city in Australia.The areas of Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Stretton, Robertson, Calamvale, Macgregor, Eight Mile Plains, Runcorn and Rochedale, are home to a large proportion of Brisbane's Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong-born population, with Chinese being the most commonly-reported ancestry in each of these areas. The Vietnamese-born are the largest immigrant group in Inala, Darra, Durack, Willawong, Richlands and Doolandella. The Indian-born are the largest immigrant group in Chermside.2.4% of the population, or 54,158 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nAt the 2016 census, 78% of inhabitants spoke only English at home, with the next most common languages being Mandarin (2.4%), Vietnamese (1.0%), Cantonese (0.9%), Spanish (0.7%), Hindi (0.6%), Samoan (0.6%), Korean (0.6%) and Punjabi (0.6%).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly cited religious affiliations was 'No religion' (30.6%).Brisbane's most popular religion at the 2016 census was Christianity, and the most popular denomonations were Catholicism (21.5%) and Anglicanism (13.3%). Other Christian denominations including Uniting Church, Baptists, Pentecostalism, Lutheranism and Eastern Orthodox made up 18.8% of the population. All Christian demoninations totalled 53.6% of the population. Brisbane's CBD is home to two cathedrals \u2013 St John's (Anglican) and St Stephen's (Catholic).\nThe most popular non-Christian religions at the 2016 census were Buddhist (2%), Muslim (1.5%) and Hindu (1.5%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCategorised as a global city, Brisbane is among Asia-Pacific cities with largest GDPs and is one of the major business hubs in Australia, with strengths in mining, banking, insurance, transportation, information technology, real estate and food.Some of the largest companies headquartered in Brisbane, all among Australia's largest, include Suncorp Group, Virgin Australia, Aurizon, Bank of Queensland, Flight Centre, CUA, Sunsuper, QSuper, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, Star Entertainment Group, ALS, TechnologyOne, NEXTDC, Super Retail Group, New Hope Coal, Jumbo Interactive, National Storage, Collins Foods and Boeing Australia. Most major Australian companies, as well as numerous international companies, have contact offices in Brisbane.\nBrisbane throughout its history has been one of Australia's most important seaport cities. The Port of Brisbane located at the Brisbane River's mouth on Moreton Bay and on the adjacent Fisherman's Island, created by means of land reclamation. It is the 3rd busiest port in Australia for value of goods. Container freight, sugar, grain, coal and bulk liquids are the major exports. Most of the port facilities are less than three decades old and some are built on reclaimed mangroves and wetlands. The Port is a part of the Australia TradeCoast, which includes the Brisbane Airport along with large industrial estates located along both banks at the mouth of the Brisbane River.White-collar industries include information technology, financial services, higher education and public sector administration generally concentrated in and around the central business district and satellite hubs located in the inner suburbs such as South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley, Spring Hill, Milton and Toowong.\nBlue-collar industries, including petroleum refining, stevedoring, paper milling, metalworking and QR railway workshops, tend to be located on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River proximal to the Port of Brisbane and in new industrial zones on the urban fringe.\nTourism is an important part of the Brisbane economy, both in its own right and as a gateway to other areas of Queensland, as international education, with over 95,000 international students enrolled in universities and other tertiary education institutions in the central Brisbane City Council local government area alone in 2018.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail in the CBD is centred around the Queen Street Mall, which is Queensland's largest pedestrian mall. Shopping centres in the CBD include the Myer Centre, the Wintergarden, MacArthur Central and QueensPlaza, with the last of these along with Edward Street forming the city's focus for luxury brands. There are historical shopping arcades at Brisbane Arcade and Tattersalls Arcade. Suburbs adjacent to the CBD such as Fortitude Valley (particularly James Street), South Brisbane and West End are also a major inner-city retail hubs.\nOutside of the inner-city, retail is focused on indoor shopping centres, including numerous regional shopping centres along with six super regional shopping centres, all of which are among Australia's largest, namely: Westfield Chermside in the north; Westfield Garden City in the south; Westfield Carindale in the east; Indooroopilly Shopping Centre in the west; Westfield North Lakes in the outer-north; and Logan Hyperdome in the outer-south. Brisbane's major factory outlet centres are the Direct Factory Outlets at Skygate and Jindalee.\nThe 100 hectare Brisbane Markets at Rocklea are Brisbane's largest wholesale markets, whilst smaller markets operate at numerous locations throughout the city including South Bank Parklands, Davies Park in West End, Queensland and the Eat Street Markets at Hamilton.\n\n\n== Culture and sport ==\n\nBrisbane is home to several art galleries, the largest of which are the Queensland Art Gallery and the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA), which is the largest modern art gallery in Australia. GOMA holds the Asia Pacific Triennial (APT) which focuses on contemporary art from the Asia and Pacific in a variety of media from painting to video work. In Addition, its size enables the gallery to exhibit particularly large shows.\nDramatic and musical theatre performances are held at the multiple large theatres located at Queensland Performing Arts Centre (QPAC). The Brisbane Powerhouse in New Farm and the Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts in Fortitude Valley also feature diverse programs featuring exhibitions and festivals of visual art, music and dance. Brisbane is also home to numerous small theatres including the Brisbane Arts Theatre in Petrie Terrace, the La Boite Theatre Company which performs at the Roundhouse Theatre at Kelvin Grove, the Twelfth Night Theatre at Bowen Hills, the Metro Arts Theatre in Edward Street, and the Queensland Theatre Company's Bille Brown Theatre in West End.\nThe Queensland Performing Arts Centre (QPAC) at South Bank, consists of the Lyric Theatre, the Concert Hall, the Cremorne Theatre and the Playhouse Theatre and is home to the Queensland Ballet, Opera Queensland, the Queensland Theatre Company, and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. The Queensland Conservatorium, a musical conservatorium in which professional music companies and conservatorium students also stage performances, is located within the South Bank Parklands. Numerous choirs present performances across the city annually. These choirs include the Brisbane Chorale, Queensland Choir, Brisbane Chamber Choir, Canticum Chamber Choir, Brisbane Concert Choir, Imogen Children's Chorale and Brisbane Birralee Voices.\nBrisbane has maintained a constantly evolving live music scene, producing acts spanning genres including punk (see Brisbane punk rock), indie rock, electronic music, experimental music, noise rock, metal and post-punk. Brisbane's live music history is often intertwined with social unrest and authoritarian politics, as retold by journalist Andrew Stafford in Pig City: From The Saints to Savage Garden, Radical Brisbane: An Unruly History, edited by academics Raymond Evans and Carole Ferrier, and BNE \u2013 The Definitive Archive: Brisbane Independent Electronic Music Production 1979\u20132014, produced by record label director Dennis Remmer.

          "Great for the bucket list however took too long when you pressed the emergency button when my son got scared, extremely unfriendly place with constant hassling you for photos you don\u2019t want",
          "Good value for money we really enjoyed the night tide the most and the twinkling lights of the city. Comfortable carriages friendly staff definitely add to your to do list in good weather when visiting Brisbane and south bank",
          "This was my second time on the wheel, the first during the day. The views of BrisVegas are still superb and you get a decent length of time up in the air. The gondola stops for a while up top so claustrophobics take note (just chill and focus on the views). The experience is",
          "It's great to see the city from this high. In the wheel they also tell you something about the city. It's just expensive.",
          "If you\u2019re up for indulgence, this 10 minute ride that makes 4 loops gives you a 360 view. A short voice recording highlights key features. The enclosed cab makes the most acrophobic feel comfortable. Go if you want to a bit of decadence.",
          "Very good value for money on the Channel Severn Wheel of Brisbane, excellent views of the city and the river.",
          "A nice place to take a walk, see the city lights and have a nice meal with friends or family. Southbank is the best spot to see or take pictures of the Brisbane city lights at night and get beautiful reflections of the lights on the rivers water.",
          "Went a little later in the evening and pretty much had the whole wheel to ourselves. The views are stunning at night, however it is a tad overpriced... especially for a family.",
          "Completely overpriced. I don\u2019t know why anyone would pay more than $20 for a ride. It\u2019s even cheaper on the Oktoberfest. :D",
          "Beautiful views of Brisbane Rivercity when on the Wheel as the sun sets. Can take refreshments to enjoy while on the ride.",
          "I found this to be a great way view the amazing scenery of the heart of Brisbane. It is spectacular to do it either during the day or in the evening.",
          "Good views, but not as spectacular as London Eye or Singapore Flyer. It\u2019s a mini version of Melbourne Star. Just something to tick off the bucket list",
          "Really enjoyed going on this on our first night in the city. Spectacular views, good commentary, just the right amount of time onboard (4 full revolutions) Friendly staff and no queues. Great value for money.",
          "A value for money tourist attraction that offers splendid views up and down the river and across to the CBD.",
          "We were surprised that there was not a queue when we went to go on the wheel but fantastic for us. It costs $22 each for adults to get on and $35 for the photo package that includes digital copies to download online. We had a capsule to ourselves and the time on the wheel was",
          "Lovely slow view around Brisbane central area. Easy access with only 5 min wait. Enjoyed the detailed commentary of all the surrounding areas and important features. Southbank over the river is where to find it.",
          "The wheels okay, however did get some attitude from the staff when telling them that we did not want a photo.",
          "Buy tixs on line. Get a 5% discount. Clean. Team friendly. Our carriages audio wasn\u2019t working and air con was dripping water but with a 4 yr old & 2 10 yr olds it was still a good experience.",
          "We went at night and the views were pretty but nothing outstanding. Worth a spin if you have kids or visiting but not necessarily a 'must do'. A bit pricey for what you get so I wouldn't go back. They could also lose the tacky photo op at the start, too - take your own from the",
          "For something different, it was OK. The commentary was brief as was the actual ride. It's unfortuante for this attraction that we had a comparison in Singapore and there is NO comparison. Certainly recommended if you have never been on a big wheel before.",
          "This is just outside QPAC. Good views from the top. A pleasant few minutes. Think we went around about 5 times. You can buy some wine with your ticket, but not sure you'd have much time to savour it. A nice thing to do. Recommended.",
          "Surprisingly the whee goes quite quickly when you are on it. 4 full turns around. Would have been better if you could identify some of the landmarks.",
          "We visited the wheel at night and also bought a cheese platter at the ticket office to share. It was a great thingto do with some friends and picking out some of the local sights amd landmarks in the dark of the winter evening, as the wheel travelled around, was fun.",
          "Took my Mum for a surprise ride on this, she absolutely loved it. Glorious views on a magic day. I wouldn't reccomend if weather is rubbish. Clean & spacious carriages. You have heaps of time to take some happy snaps of the wonderful view & of course of each other. Definitely",
          "The wheel is easy to find on Southbank, the views some of the best Brisbane has to offer. If you looking for something romantic to do before or after dinner in Southbank then this is a must",
          "Would definitely recommend doing this at least once, especially if you can time it to be at Sunset. Booking online through RACQ gets you a good discount. I did think that in all the excitement of being on it for the first time we missed out on most of the commentary, so perhaps",
          "My husband and I took a ride on the Brisbane wheel. Its air conditioned and comfortable. You get 10 to 15 mins to enjoy the sites. I recommend if your in Brisbane go ride the wheel.",
          "Bringing a friend from the states to see Brisbane in a better light & perspective the wheel was a good choice , good value , friendly staff good experience.",
          "We enjoyed our time and remembered our childhood. We were missing only our candy floss \ud83d\ude0a Beautiful views, air conditioned gondolas. Thanks",
          "I love to see a new side of a new city from a height, so I thought I\u2019d take advantage of the wheel of Brisbane for this purpose! It\u2019s great, don\u2019t hesitate to go. There is a great map and audio tour initially to make sure you can orientate yourself with the local landmarks which",
          "Enjoyed the actual ride but the view during the day was rather boring. Think it would be a lot nicer at night.",
          "The location of the wheel is perfect, south bank of river. I booked the $150 Nye fireworks package for the Gondola. To our disappointment, the Gondola glass was so dirty everything was blurred. Amd it had not rained for 3 days prior, so no excuse day. Guys, you have a good",
          "Well, nothing exciting to see up here, but I don't mind a Ferris Wheel ride. Slow enough to see the view and you get two revolutions so you can notice more the second time around. Value for money? Sure if there's only a couple of you. Get a deal on Red Balloon or similar to make",
          "A little different than what we expected and a bit expensive. The cabins are not very big. It does though have a nice view of Brisbane from the top!!",
          "Never understood this wheel so for a discounted whirl around we thought why not. I still wish I had wondered rather then experienced :) Better off walking around south bank and the city",
          "A bit pricey but still enjoyed it. You go round 4 times first time get com\u2019u try about area etc. You can buy wine to drink on the wheel but it\u2019s 8 dollars a small bottle",
          "The wheel completes about 5 full rounds during which you will be briefed about the local attractions in Brisbane. The wheel is relatively small and at some point in air, stops for a short while. It was amazing to be there at night and they maintain cleanliness. We were charged",
          "Great ride, although scary when stopped at the very top. The views are expansive and a lovely perspective to the city.",
          "I've been excited to go on the Wheel of Brisbane for years. It was really nice, nice views, air conditioned and just plain cool. My only negative is that at some point the car swings and as I get older I seem to be afraid of heights. All in all I'm glad I did it and I would",
          "the view over the city is fantastic at night. we did not need to line up so got through pretty easily. We did have a wine on the trip and was well organised when you get in the capsule. Tip though is check the payment as only after checking the statement did we realise we had",
          "Really enjoyed the experience of riding on the wheel! Easy access in the Southbank area. Air conditioned pods ensured a comfortable ride on a very hot day! Don\u2019t forget to show your Seniors card for a good discount! Views along the river & over the city are great.",
          "We went for a bit of fun and that's what we got. Prices were $17 for adults and $13 for the children (purchased online as it was cheaper). Kids had fun, was a little warm but this is Brisbane. I would recommend this if you wanted to sit down for 30 mins.",
          "Was great going on the wheel and being able to see all the brisbane river up high. We went in the afternoon, so we got to watch the beautiful sunset as we went around. Got to take nice photos of the river and surrounding buildings.",
          "We were visiting just for a few nights and enjoyed our experience on the wheel. There were great views of the city and it was quite stunning at night time with the wheel itself also lit up. The photo package offered at the end was beautiful but a little expensive at $35.",
          "After doing the Melbourne ride many years ago I expected this would be similar. Was disappointed in the hard to hear commentary, and really felt design of the pods was questionable as most of the best city views were hampered by the door frames. (Maybe shouldve configured to",
          "Will never visit another wheel anywhere. It is ridiculously expensive, and like every other city, the views are rubbish.",
          "It deserves to be tried. 10 mins at the top of Brisbane city, with a magnificent view of its river and the CBD. I am not sure if it would be better to have that been done before sunset or not. But it might be nice to have that tour at the sunset time itself. It cost 20$ per",
          "This was fantastic trip, best thing was the commentary explaining what we were looking at. Great to have air-con in the pods. Lovely smooth motion.",
          "We had a ride on the wheel to see the sights of Brisbane city and the river. Great views. Very enjoyable.",
          "We actually visited this in October 2017. Great experience lovely views. Booked our own gondola expecting it to be very busy, but it wasn\u2019t. So there was no need to book one ah well. I wanted to ensure a private one as I was popping the question! Got some really cute photos with",
          "It was our last day in Brisbane and we headed to Sputhbank to fill in a few hours. The Wheel looked quite cool and the price was reasonable so we piled in. Great views over the City and to the mountains made us pleased we went on the ride.",
          "Spent a week in Brisbane and decided to do the standard tourist walk around Southbank. Couldn't resist the Wheel. Popped on with 2 kids and hubby. Totally enjoyed the ride. Wheel went full circle 5 times and there was a brief talk about the top 10 viewing points from the Wheel.",
          "Located on the fringes of Brisbane River, it affords the best view of the city. Depending on one\u2019s preference, day or night, this ferries wheel gives a 360 degrees view of the environs, the CBD, the outlying suburbs and the surrounding sea of the City of Brisbane. Tip:The view",
          "A much enjoyed entertainment being on the wheel of Brisbane. Fantastic view from the top of the wheel,looking around the area. Price for four of us was about $73.00. had photos taken and brought those. Went around about 4 times. We felt it was worth the money.",
          "Can\u2019t say to much more then this. Biggest issue I had was commentary was not in line with wheel amd the location",
          "Great views, air conditioned, lots of room, good music played and went around a fair few times. Would go again!",
          "In a moment of stupidity I said \u201cshall we go on?\u201d....and we did! Now I have a terrific fear of heights so spent 95% of the time with my eyes shut! My husband though enjoyed every minute! We were told it was 4 rotations, so I was glad when the 4th was over...but oh no they did",
          "Had a Sunday visit to South Bank and took a spin around on the wheel. First around had a good commentary great views of Brisbane, would be very pretty at night with all the lights. Went around about 5 times. Thought it was okay.",
          "Air conditioned seating, fully enclosed for safety, informative and great views of Brisbane cbd. Good value for money and for all ages.",
          "Great experience with an informative commentary of the history of the key landmarks around Brisbane. Views are fantastic. Air Conditioned so don\u2019t worry about comfort in the sun. It\u2019s a great experience.",
          "A great way to see Brisbane from a bit higher up, I definitely recommend it. The staff were friendly and the ride was sturdy, we went at sunset which was a nice experience",
          "Really comfortable, air conditioning and the guide talk given thru the ride very informative. Don't usually take the photos but we did here great value for money all riund",
          "Very enjoyable ride with great views and photos of the city, southbank and river. My daughter and I really enjoyed the experience.",
          "Just at the start of Southbank Park, this big wheel can give you a great view from the top of the city, Brisbane river and the beautiful park around.",
          "After lots of walking it was good to sit and be taken round and round, looking at the sites of Brisbane from on high. Staff very friendly.",
          "This is a ferris wheel on the Brisbane River. The view is ok and the experience was fine but having visited other similar wheels around the world this is one I wouldn't rush back to. I'm sure tourists love it, but for the price and 2 turns you probably get a better view of the",
          "Good Value offer to see Brisbane City from a high vantage point. Comfortable efficient service and in a great location at South Bank.",
          "Usual wheel experience but it\u2019s great to see the city from above and how the geography all works. 75 cent surcharge for credit cards annoying. Pods comfortable with good air conditioning",
          "Gorgeous ride at night the lights of the city. Just stunning. Love going on the wheel \ud83d\udc9e Got the photo pack and had a marvellous time!",
          "It was a pleasant way to view the city. I thought it was reasonably priced and we didn\u2019t have to wait too long either.",
          "Look, this isn\u2019t as big as the London Eye but it\u2019s a nice, informative journey around the wheel a few times and gives you a great view of Brisbane so well worth the cost. If you have a family, check around as to where to buy your tickets. You may save a bit. We bought ours from",
          "We have done the Melbourne Star, so I guess in comparison to that, this was very quick and cramped. Just your average gondola that goes around quickly 4 times, so doesn't leave much time to take a nice photo at the top. The commentary doesn't match what your currently looking",
          "If u want a great view of Brisbane well u must do the Channel 7 ferriswheel located in Southbank Brisbane CBD! It has a great view of the Brisbane river were river cat swims! I give a 9/10",
          "Lovely views of Brisbane. It went around 5 times so was really good value for money. We got vouchers too for 20% off from city river cruise.",
          "As much as the views are spectacular cost of ticket is a bit too high especially if it's a family ticket. All in all the ride itself lasts from 10 to 15 minutes, rotating 4 times. The cabins are enclosed and are airconditioned.",
          "Its a nice hp and down foe a couple of times. Up there one have a good view bit thats it. In my opinion not worth the 80 bugs for a family of 5...",
          "This stop was organized as part of our business event and what a great surprise. Very clean and tidy pods. We had 3 rotations I think and the views were amazing. What a beautiful city at night.",
          "its kind of ok, its not a long ride and its not that high so you dont see lots and lots but i guess if you were only coming to brisbane once you would do it just to do it.",
          "Such a shame the ride is so short. For the amount of money you pay to go up, you would appreciate more time in the air.",
          "The 60 metre high wheel similar to the London Eye only slightly faster and you get four revolutions. We did it after dark where the skyscrapers look great lite up. 24 A$ AUD for adults with pap discount of 5$. Found out later if you combine it with the cruise you get a better",
          "I was viewing the wheel and decided to jump on as a spare of the moment thing. Was a nice day so the view of the city was excellent. I would recommend for families and couples as a great experience.",
          "We\u2019ve been on a wheel in several cities now, and Brisbane\u2019s is probably the smallest, but it still offers fantastic views of the city and river. There\u2019s an informative commentary as you ascend for the first rotation, then you\u2019re left to enjoy the views. We did 4 rotations,",
          "Went down for a Ferris wheel ride with a group of friends, to find out it was $20 per ticket. This is excessive to begin with let alone the ride only going for about 5 minutes. Steer clear, I had more fun riding around on a Lime scooter and it was over half the price cheaper and",
          "Relaxing 15 minute ride. Air conditioned & with commentary. Kids enjoyed it....freaked them out a bit when we stopped at the top!",
          "Why so fast if u hv to go 5 times over .. Good views Good location See brissy from tops.. Do if u hv nothing else to do..",
          "I enjoyed the ride on the Wheel of Brisbane. It was night time and so everything was lit up. The onboard commentary was excellent and I had a nice long ride. The lady who sold me my ticket, gave me a slight discount as I am a senior citizen.",
          "Went on the wheel with a family member. It was good, price is probably a little steep though. If you have even a slight fear of heights it\u2019s definitely not for you. I was surprised at how the slightest movement can rattle the gondola by what seemed like a lot.",
          "We paid AUD$22 per adult and got six per pod. It went around six times. If you\u2019re going to take a chatter try to keep them quiet for the first rotation as this is where you are going to get the history. The other five have no commentary. We all really enjoy the experience.",
          "Nice views of Brisbane river and skyline. Ride is bit short close to 10 minutes. Adult tickets cost AUD 14 . Good for pictures.",
          "As an expatriate Queenslander, I was interested to experience the much vaunted Wheel - I wasn\u2019t disappointed- it was great, & seemed to have enough time & revolutions of the Wheel to take in all the sights on a beautiful day. What I appreciated was that my friend & I were",
          "I\u2019ve got to say it. Thought it was a rip off. Was fairly empty and you get to go around 4 times (we got 5). $64 for a family of 4. Not so sure that this is a must but now the kids will stop nagging. Kids are $14.50 but cannot go without an adult. Not an essential Brisbane thing",
          "This was my first ride of Ferris Wheel! Very calm and smooth with the pre-taped background narration of Brisbane's hot spot! What did I like about it? It's seating! The small cabins can easily accommodate 2 - 4 persons! I didn't mind enjoying the space around me alone! I enjoyed",
          "So worth it. Pods comfortably fit 6 people. Such a beautiful view of beautiful Brisbane. Set on the river. It was better than I thought and the ride is really good value. It's a winner! I think you can book in advance and that is worth doing. You'll get excellent photos and",
          "Ironically considering it is a Channel 7 Wheel, we had seen this wheel out of an office window whilst watching the ABC series Harrow. So whilst visiting Brisbane it was a must find and enjoy. The wheel located at South Bank is a short walk from the South Brisbane railway",
          "Our 7 year old twins love going on this every time we visit South Bank (school holidays). This time we had a school friend and 2 year old sister. All kids loved it! Great view of the Parklands from the top. Feels very safe. We had 2 adults and 4 children comfortably in our",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed the Brisbane Wheel. Great views of the city. No queues but it is winter . Just a few minutes walk from South Bank. After the wheel walk across the bridge and straight into Queen Street Mall. Only a 5 minute walk. Loads to do and lots of shops and places to",
          "Lovely experience, despite being drizzly was still a wonderful view of Brisbane. Cometary was very informative, particularly liked the option of controlling the volume. Well ventilated, comfortable & clean, didn\u2019t feel claustrophobic, felt safe as the wheel rotated at a",
          "We can\u2019t walk past a big wheel when on holiday and we were pleased to take a trip on this one. Decent sized cabins and a nice slow pace allowed us to take in the views. After about five or six rotations our time came to an end. Not expensive and worth a visit.",
          "Felt it was pretty ordinary with small cabins . Also not a lot to see in brisbane. I wouldnt recommend it",
          "When 1st seeing the prizes I thought it a bit expensive however knowing we would not be in Brisbane much thought might as well give it a go. Was very impressed with the view and the commentary",
          "If you want to see Brisbane do this at night.....or..go to Mt Cootha look out. Easy to get to via South Bank. Lots to look at during a walk there. Love the river",
          "I don't know if having done the London eye twice, day and night, I was being a bit critical of this and didn't want to do it, but my nephews wanted to go on it so I went on with the family. Well, i'm glad I bought the tickets (cheaper) on Groupon, as I didn't have a good",
          "Like a lot of others we had a Groupon voucher....and as such it was good value. It was a humid wet afternoon when we went on this. It was blessedly air conditioned inside the pods and we had one to ourselves. Due to the weather (rain) I think our views were a little compromised",
          "I inadvertently bought two Groupon vouchers for two people on the wheel, so we were then able to go on both at night and in the day time. Both experiences were amazing. We were blessed with good weather both times, although the rain clouds provided a dramatic backdrop for",
          "Surprised by the very affordable ticket price. Went around a number of times and had a great view of everything! Friendly staff.",
          "We were here mid morning on a Saturday. We thought it would be busy, but there was no line-up and we quickly boarded. The wheel moved at a reasonable pace and made the circuit several times because no one else was loading or disembarking. The views were amazing on the mountains",
          "Unexpected stop but we loved it. The views of Brisbane were fantastic. I'd highly recommend it for anyone",
          "My fear of heights came to the fore as we started to rise, not helped by my partner rattling the gondola. Thankfu\u013aly there was an emergency button which I pushed with enthusiasm. They stopped for me & let me off.",
          "The giant wheel that gave us a grand view of our surrounds and the Brisbane River. It was a nice experience, but found the cost @ $22 per adult, a bit steep for 4 complete revolutions. Although great, it remains a one time experience. It would be more advantageous if the ride",
          "Great way to see the city and surrounding area, rocks a bit when you step up high to let punters off but very enjoyable",
          "Great modern ferris wheel. I am a little funny with heights but these comfortable pods made me feel safe. Brisbane is quite a pretty city. Heres my tip. Tickets are on Groupon just search for them. We got 40% discount there always seems to be groupon offers for the big wheel. I",
          "Very good experience, kids were enjoying, the whole family enjoyed the rides. I will reccommend this place to everyone.",
          "Was a bit quick going around. Went at night would've been better during the day, you wou,d see more. Good price though",
          "Went on Ferris wheel with my wife on a week night. The staff were helpful. As far as price goes, lucky we bought online discount tickets thought for what it was to be expensive.",
          "Living in Brisbane we have always just walked past the wheel of Brisbane. today we decided to give it a whirl so to speck. No queuing today walked straight up & bought tickets. $22.00 each adult. Presented with the now everywhere blue screen photo opportunity before a short wait",
          "Had to queue up for a while but was a pleasant ride, cubicles are airconditiond and comfortable but 15 dollars a person a bit rich",
          "Seems all city's now have a giant wheel I did not go on this as my wife wasn't well at the time ,but it looks stunning. Ideally situated in the city right next to the Brisbane River",
          "I went with a group and we were just looking for something to do to kill some time, it was overpriced, but between the line and the experience, it definitely killed time for us. It was a good time, but definitely not a \"must do\" for Brisbane.",
          "This was the only place we experienced lack of courtesy whilst traveling in Australia. We had booked many trips on the Oz website and when I snap shot the book I sadly left off the booking number but all other info correct. I had no email service on my phone. Arrived (5 of us",
          "Recommend for travellers wanting to see Brisbane from a unique perspective. The commentary is quite informative of Brisbane\u2019s history and interesting to hear.",
          "The views from the wheel are incredible. Situated on the river bank, you have incredible views across the river and of the nearby gardens. Did find that $22 a little bit pricey. I liked the fact that the pods are enclosed so are great for cold/wet weather aswell as beautiful",
          "I'm from London and love the eye, so couldn't help but make comparisons. The Wheel is lovely, though personally I did not like the fact that the pods shake (like a Ferris wheel), the commentary I found annoying rather than informative. It's good value for money though and",
          "My wife and I took two grandchildren on the Channel & Wheel of Brisbane and being a mixed age group we all enjoyed the experience. It was a lovely cl;ear day and we were able to see to the hills and Mount Cootha and many icons along the Brisbane River.",
          "for a fee of 22 dollars, you get the change to see the skyline of brisbane from different perspective. nice instragrammable view",

          "What a great way to see around Southbank and a part of The Brisbane river. Goes nice and slow as it goes around, about 5 times. The little cabins are clean and have a good lighting and sound system in them. You can take drinks and food on board which is great. If you buy your",
          "While not as big as the London Eye this wheel gives visitors and locals great views out across Brisbane. There is a map and commentary supplied so buildings are easy to identify and the capsule is air conditioned in summer! There is a train station close by or it is an easy walk",
          "On a whim decided to try the Wheel. We have seen them in various cities, but never tried them. It was an evening ride, we had a short wait as the queue to board was not long. We boarded our hub and before long we\u2019re on our way. The views were great, the ride had plenty of",

          "As a lark, we decided to go on the Wheel. The gondolas are fully closed and air conditioned (which was great as the temperature was over 36C) and we given four rotations on the wheel. The view of the city is excellent and there is an audio tour to help you understand what you",

          "Every city seems to want one of these and they do nothing to make the place look better/good. This one travelled air the speed of a fairground wheel and did not really allow enough time to take in the view or capture it.",
          "Wheel of Brisbane is a great way to view most of Brisbane.. we got our monies worth and did 8 rotations on the wheel.. as it wasn't so busy.. the kids loved it... only negative would be is that it goes a little too fast.. needs to be slowed down so people can take decent photos",
          "Had a trip on the Big Wheel with our Groupon discounted tickets which worked out to be half the price. Normal price for adults is $21. My bf was scared of heights which made it funnier for me. Great experience at a bargain price.",

          "Seeing we were visiting Southbank parklands, we made the effort to take a ride and it was well worth the trip. It cost us $21 per adult but there are other packages with food and drinks etc. We were lucky enough to do 5 revolutions in our 10 or so minutes which gave us plenty",
          "It was a very hot morning when we visited the wheel. Very small queue as it had just opened. Only waited a few minutes to get on. Fabulous views of Brisbane, air conditioned inside the capsule. It does go around quite quickly in comparison to other wheels around the world but",
          "The Big Wheel is within walking distance from South Bank. Definitiely a \"must do\" not only fun for the whole family but fabulous views from up the top. Felt very safe. Look out for coupons on Groupon as they come up regularly and will save you a few dollars. My three",

          "Great thing to do as a tourist, I would highly recommend. As a local probably only something you would do once or twice (day and night) I would definitely take overseas relatives though. Cabins are spacious, air conditioned and clean. I\u2019m not big on heights and almost didn\u2019t go",
          "Now this was fabulous...I'm a little nervous of heights and this does go high but I felt very safe. The views were spectacular at night (our chosen time).The wheel turns slowly and the ride lasts just on 15mins. Well worth the money.",
          "If you can afford the admission cost and are considering it as a one-off for the novelty experience, then it is worth it. The cabins are spacious and air conditioned and there is a commentary that comes through the loud speakers. That said I do believe it is very overpriced for",

          "There weren\u2019t huge lines when we went on December 30th, so I was very amazed. We were quick to board our ride and enjoyed the great views. We thought we would only go around once, but we went around three or four times. It was great and staff were pleasant.",

          "Have been to Brisbane many times and always said that we should go on the Wheel of Brisbane. Finally did it and it was great. Great commentary in each car gives a quick over view of Brisbane and South Bank. We did the ride during the day but I imagine the night view would be",
          "Paid an extortionate amount for the \"VIP\" experience only to be told to wait in the blistering heat with a baby for 20mins before we could even get on. Absolute rubbish for money.",
          "Surely not as big as the London Eye or the HUGE one in sunny Dubai, but still offered breathtaking views of this facinating city. Overall--8/10",
          "Another iconic thing to tick off the list when visiting Southbank in Brisbane. Great during the day to really \u201csee\u201d Brisbane, awesome at night to enjoy the pretty lights.",
          "Because it is not the highest place to sightsee in Brisbane you may not choose to try but really enjoyable and still a great view.",
          "Was a great view enjoyed the ride seening the city of brisbrane not a long wait in the hot sun either",
          "Really enjoyed the ride. We went during dusk so we were able to see all the buildings lit up. It was comfortable and secure. The aircon was a blessing on the hot summer evenings. We also got Christmas gifts because we went on Christmas Day! It\u2019s simple and memorable.",
          "This was superb! Kids loved it! Pod was roomy! Views were super! Absolutely worth it!! Would definitely go again!",
          "Great views of Brisbane, good commentary, ride is pleasent, cabin is well air conditioned. Good attraction at South bank. Backpacks not allowed",
          "Very nice view of Brisbane from the sky... Comfortable and air conditioned cabins... Five laps allowing you to enjoy views from all directions...",
          "Great views of Brisbane. 3 rotations with commentary and 2 to take in the view. Expensive ferris wheel at $56.50 for two adults and a child.",
          "Spent an hour on the banks of the river Brisbane and thought will give the wheel a try. A nice experience though a bit overpriced. We get some awesome views from the top but I wish the wheel would go a bit slower.",
          "We took the ride when it was drizzling but we have quite a view! No queue when we were there, most probably because it was raining. We feel safe during the ride",
          "The ride moves fairly slowly giving you ample time to take photographs while listening to the pre-recorded tour guide point out the landmarks. The pods are fully secure and air-conditioned making for a comfortable ride. Apparently discounted tickets are easy to come by online",
          "Right on the Brisbane River front South bank ,a must visit attraction. One can have great views from the ride at slow speed.",
          "It\u2019s ok, gives you a great view over parts of the city but not the most exciting thing to do in Brisbane",
          "Try and get a discount ticket as they are available everywhere ie.. online or with RACQ membership. It is worth the price even as a one off, the views of Brisbane are brilliant. if you can get up just before sunset and see the lights coming on it is so worth it.",
          "I went with my family on this on and was a great to have a different perspective of Brisbane. We were perusing the gallery and looking around Southbank and this was naturally an activity to experience. They say it goes for 10-15 minutes, I\u2019m guessing 10mins if there is queue.",
          "A fun attraction on Brisbane river to take in the views of the city, river and Southbank parklands! Great value for money, we went around a few times, got some nice pictures and were able to orientate ourselves to Brisbane - recommended for first time visitors :)",
          "My husband and I rode the wheel of Brisbane dry soon after arriving in Brisbane. It was neat because the narration and map provides visitors with a good idea of where things are from a great vantage point.",
          "We got discount tickets on Groupon Was a beautiful sunny day, so great views Air conditioning in gondola Didn't have to wait long It's something you would do once The selling of Photoshopped pics errrggghh",
          "Yes is worth the ticket especially the VIP Gondola. Great views & great location. Is located in the heart of the beautiful southbank, which offers a selection of awesome bars & restaurants. The gondola is now iconic to the area.",
          "We mistakenly went on a rainy day - paid usual full price however could not be able to see much at all. I feel like it should be slightly discounted if visibility is poor as you only end up feeling a bit ripped off. Wouldn\u2019t bother again.",
          "It was a rather hot day so we were very happy to find our ride on the wheel a nice comfortable temperature inside the compartment. It was quite informative and a good way to get your bearings when visiting Brisbane",
          "When I went on the wheel of Brisbane I was actually the only person on the wheel. I went around about 15 times and even got a stop at the top. I was on for a very long time. The view is wonderful. The price was kind of expensive, but if you\u2019re just swinging through town like I",
          "We went up on the wheel on a hot, clear, day so very much enjoyed the view and the ac. You go around 4-5x, which is not immediately clear, but you get a good intro the city and it\u2019s surrounds. A bit expensive, but nice to see, and a good stopover on a hot day.",
          "This is a lovely giant Ferris wheel, located on the south bank of the Brisbane river. While the skyline of Brisbane isn't the finest you could find, it's worth getting on the wheel if you'd like to experience it from above, especially in the evening.",
          "Had a few hours to kill. Warm night saw this big wheel thought why not.. reminds me of London eye. Was fun and good views . Staff were nice and polite. I enjoy the time going around seeing all the colours that night time brings out",
          "Good intro to Brisbane with commentary. Worth seeing both during the day and at night - the sunsets are spectacular?",
          "The pods that you are placed in feel sturdy, safe and don't rock which is fantastic - especially of you have a fear of heights as I do. I went alone to work on conquering my fear and was lucky enough to go around 7 times! (They promise 4 times). I went at night, the view was",
          "A good number of revolutions make this worthwhile for getting great aerial shots of CBD and the south beach area.",
          "A really cool thing to do with friends visiting australia. Air conditioning inside the pods and it was a smooth and gentle ride. Lots of fun and friendly service.",
          "Inexpensive and easily accessible ride with panoramic views across Brisbane CBD and South Bank entertainment park.",
          "I am a long time Brissy girl, and did not think I needed to do the wheel, and it was for tourist. Not so! I bought a \"have a meal on the wheel\" deal and it was amazing. We had entree on the first 3 circles, then Main, and desert, with matching wine! Taking in an amazing view",
          "Was great to see Brisbane from this advantage point. The staff where friendly and the area well maintained. Clear instructions where issues about how to use the aircon. Was surprised how many times we went around, I thought it was good value for money.",
          "I recently visited with my daughter and my 4 year old granddaughter - and my granddaughter is the one who wanted to go on the wheel. The three of us enjoyed the ride immensely- although tame after the London eye wheel, it gives lovely views of Brisbane and the river! A very",
          "We feel one of the best ways to see a city is from its wheel ( The London Eye gives one amazing views) likewise the Wheel of Brisbane gives one beautiful views of the river, the many different buildings along its edge and the lush tropical rainforest area of South Bank. Well",
          "Air conditioned comfort and easy wheelchair access this is a reasonably priced attraction for visitors and locals. At an optional extra cost a professional photographer captures the essence of you with the views. Suitable for everyone and located in the heart of South Bank.",
          "Had a great time on the wheel. We rode it after sunset and couldn't see much in the distance. Next time we would want to ride it during the day. My 5 year old loves it and wanted to go again. Friendly staff. Ride time approx 10 minutes",
          "Caught our trip at dusk. Got to see the city light up. Really enjoyed it. Very well managed and organised. Well worth the prices.",
          "I rode the Wheel of Brisbane. It\u2019s about $21 for roughly 3 or 4 rounds on the wheel. The views of Brisbane are amazing, the cabins are quite big and very clean and the staff lovely .. definitely worth",
          "I love the Wheel if Brisbane. When I see it day or night, it triggers a joyful holiday mode feeling in my world. I know I have arrived! South Bank happiness!",
          "When I first arrived at Southbank with some family I was a little underwhelmed by the Brisbane Wheel. By international standards this appears to be a poor cousin. Quite small by any other standards. I didn\u2019t even really want to pay the few dollars to go on it but due to the kids",
          "Great pre dinner romance builder. 10minutes of views, with informative comontery. Hold hands and enjoy.",
          "The service was great and so was the ride. The views were amazing. I would definitely go again, and you can even have a wine delivered just before take off.",
          "First time on a Ferris Wheel and enjoyed the experience! Went around about 4 times at quite a good speed (but felt safe) and was air conditioned with a commentary of the view below. Glad I took the plunge!",
          "Having ridden the London Eye and the Singapore wheel I would rate the wheel at South bank good value. While not as s big as the others it does offer fantastic views of Brisbane and the suburbs",
          "Whilst visiting the Brisbane South Bank Parklands we decided to take a ride on the mini London Eye with our Grandchildren It was perfect for little people due to the sedate nature of the ride.",
          "I have been on this quite a lot over the years with grand children. It is a big plus for South Bank. Disappointing that it is not used much during the week. You get a great view from the top.",
          "We took our 7 & 9 year old in this. There were no queue (in school holidays). And they loved it. It is slightly on the expensive side so would recommend getting a ticket deal prior to going on group on if you can. The wheel went around 4 times for us. It was comfortable and",
          "Amazing views and definitely worth doing while you're in Brisbane. However, I do think it is quite expensive due to the popularity it has for tourists. Gorgeous though, worth it.",
          "It was a nice sunny day that we went to experience the view from the top of the Wheel of Brisbane. The experience was great and we had the whole cabin just for the two of us. The wheel goes around a few times before finishing at the bottom again ;) There is a voice commentary",
          "Having done a few big wheels around the world I was not sure about this one. It was surprising. While it is much smaller than some other cities it is sufficient to get a great view of the river and city. My day was overcast and raining but I still enjoyed it immensely.",
          "This is the second time I enjoyed the wheel and both times with overseas friends. Its a nice interlude after walking around southbank parklands and gives a nice perspective on the Parklands, local amenities, attractions, the River and of course a nice view of the Brisbane",
          "Fab view of the surrounds of Brisbane South Bank... we comfortably sat 4 woman... was aircon'd & had commentary. A great treat!!",
          "I've been on the wheel twice now, and it affords a wonderful view of the city and river, as well as giving many interesting facts about what can be seen in the view during the ride. I plan to take a friend of mine for her birthday soon!",
          "We visited attraction hoping to take our family of 2 adults and 3 kids 11, 8 & 2 year but $62 for 2 adults and 2 kids was prohibitive for us, disappointing.",
          "Amazing experience with great views!! Staff are warm and welcoming as well. Can\u2019t go wrong!! A must see whilst in Brisbane.",
          "We previously took our kids (7yo and 5yo) on the Wheel about 18 months ago during the day. The kids loved it, so when staying a night recently in South Bank we took them back for a night time trip to view the city lights. The kids loved it. At $62 for a family pass (2ad and 2ch)",
          "Situated right on the waters edge of the Brisbane River this attraction is a great way to get an eagle eyes perspective of the beautiful city of Brisbane. Best to take a ride on a clear day to get the best views.",
          "The wheel is fun and for a tourist (or if you\u2019re showing some tourists around) a great way to get a cool view of Brisbane City and the Brisbane River.",
          "Despite living in the area we have never been on the wheel. We thoroughly enjoyed and surprised at the number of times we went round so if we missed something we got a chance to see. Recommend to locals as well as visitors.",
          "This is a great way to see Brisbane city during the day or night. There is interesting commentary provided which helps to put everything into context. It is a wee bit pricey at $21/person for a 10 minute ride. Not sure what the child/pensioner rates are. I would recommend it.",
          "What a sensational attraction to vist. Staff were friendly and was very fun Is beautiful to look at at night",
          "This would be a great place for tourists trying to see Brisbane city, it is fun but only a one time experience as it is quite pricey, if you haven\u2019t done it before I would definitely recommend it and give it a go.",
          "our family of 4 went on the Brisbane wheel on night in September. the night views of Brisbane were beautiful. highly recommend a ride on the wheel. however the carriages could do with a bit of a clean. the windows were really dirty.",
          "We had prepurchased tickets for the Wheel of Brisbane with a scoopon voucher so we decided to use them on our girls weekend. I have seen the Wheel many times and always wanted to go on it. It was enjoyable. The Wheel itself moves very slowly so you get to experience all the",
          "Wht a great attraction!!! $62 for a family ticket you really cant go wrong. There is a voiceover guide pointing out attractions. It went for a reasonable amount of time and everyone loved it.",
          "We were lucky enough to be on the wheel during the Brisbane Festival and viewed the light show during the ride. It was very enjoyable.",
          "Pretty expensive really. Kids enjoyed it. Just a glorified ferris wheel. Would recommend if you are just trying to kill some time.",
          "Glad we got a groupon discount. Wheel does three rotations and takes approx 8 mins. Just lacked a wow factor you get on the London Eye.",
          "Pleasant, fully enclosed and air-conditioned cars with commentary. Brilliant views of the city. Very enjoyable ride, nice and gentle. You get your photo taken before you go on and it's ready to view when you get off, no obligation to purchase. Want to do this again at night time",
          "This is situated on the Banks of the Brisbane river and it gives a nice view. If you have been in London eye of Melbourne wheel this will not surprise you. Small but nice.",
          "We instantly regretted getting on the wheel. Not because of anything they did, but because we figured out we didn\u2019t like heights. I guess as you grow older, your tolerance for heights lessens. Anyway, it was a nice view, but if you don\u2019t like heights, I would give it a miss.",
          "Excellent view of brisvegas on the wheel for approx 15 mins and is a delightful thing to do. Not too expensive either",
          "This is a must see for all visitors and residents of Brisbane. Very informative narrator and air conditioning is a bonus.",
          "Its a nice and quick idea to know Brisbane in 10 mins and take some good pictures of Brisbane river.",
          "Good value if you can grab a special otherwise can be pricy. Carriage we had was quite scratched on the glass so hard to take decent photos. Visitors from overseas liked it as it provides a good view of Brisbane city and Southbank.",
          "Enjoyable ride in an air conditioned cabin with great city views. You can choose to get a small refreshment package including cheese, crackers and champagne- I\u2019d recommend this as an added extra. Informative commentary helps guide you as you take a slow and steady pace. May",
          "We only had one day in Brisbane and wanted to see as much as possible and the wheel of Brisbane was a good opportunity for that. The ride is about 12 minutes with information about the area, the view and location is really nice. It is nothing spectacular but we chose to go after",
          "My kids love this! The adults find it a little boring. The view isn\u2019t that great. The cabins are air conditioned, which is nice. The photos are way over priced.",
          "A great way to look over beautiful Brisbane and admire the outstanding skyline. This place is close to the river and the river-cruise, if you go there there's the possibility to have discount for the wheel. A nice area overall with lots of attractions adn places to eat!",
          "We came on a Saturday with family in a party of 6 and it was enjoyed by all. Fitting 6 people into a gondola is tricky as we found, but it was fun and we all enjoyed the spectacular views over the Southbank parklands. Watching the river cats and the swimmers in the lagoon was",
          "A great way to see a different side of Brisbane and the surrounding area. Even though it\u2019s not overly high, in my opinion, it\u2019s not for people who don\u2019t like heights as not only are u high up it the capsule moves when you move! The map you are given of Brisbane is nothing but",
          "Price was a little high but the view made up for it! We had a great time especially my granddaughter! I wouldn\u2019t do this often but we all enjoyed it!",
          "I\u2019m a local to Brisbane but had never been in the Wheel of Brisbane before so hubby & I decided to go. It was a fair price at $21 per adult. We went at 9:30pm on a Friday night & there was only a few people waiting to go on. It was lovely to see the night lights of Brisbane &",
          "12 minute ride and reasonably priced. Good audio commentary pointing out areas of interest. Friendly staff and nice and clean and modern.",
          "Very classical way to see and understand a city. Splendid view over the town and the river. Pleasant moment to spend in a silent and relaxing way",
          "I had booked this adventure for a g/f's birthday surprise. We went out to breakfast that morning in Wynnum...jumped on the train into town..(Brisbane)..walked through the shops and over to Southbank, she had no idea what we were doing. I got the tickets while she was off taking",
          "Don\u2019t do if you have a fear of heights. Otherwise well run and well done, 4 to 5 revolutions, so lots of opportunity to take photos. Easy to access",
          "Nice night time ride with informative commentary. It may be better during the day as you'd be able to better spot the locations discussed.",
          "I recommend this for people who like heights....I do not. Saying that I booked a high tea on the wheel. You can also book meals, drinks etc. Book a time, show up, a small wait while they get organised and then get you on board and then you enjoy the amazing view while eating,",
          "We've visited Brisbane several times and not considered taking a ride on the Wheel, though we had viewed it from our hotel window. Having now 'bitten the bullet' and done so, we'll do it again. It was an amazing way to take in the views up and down the river and over the CBD.",
          "We took the wheel at night this time and it was great. I also have to congratulate the staff they were so helpful to me as I had broken my hip and was in a wheelchair but also had crutches to help me get in and out of the cable car. The city lights look so amazing from up high!!",
          "If you\u2019re in Brisbane City and not go on this Wheel you\u2019re missing out! You get a very beautiful and wide view of the whole City once you\u2019re at the top. It\u2019s the one of the \u2018must do\u2019, and it\u2019s worth it, I did it twice \ud83d\ude02",
          "I had a ride on this for just killing time. You can see the view of the city up here which is nice and peaceful",
          "We were tired of walking all day and decided to hop on the wheel. It was a bit overpriced by my standards but lovely views and there was absolutely no queue in the evening.",
          "Unlike other ferris wheels that I\u2019ve been on in London, Singapore and Las Vegas, which move continuously at a very slow speed, this wheel stops every four revolutions, to allow passengers to get on and off. That means, for example that if it\u2019s busy, be prepared to queue, and if",
          "A bit expensive at $21 for a 12 minute ride. The gondolas should be on out-riggers as the actual wheel obscures decent photos. The good memory will out-live the slight disappointment though.",
          "Wonderful experience and great views of the city. We will return to experience the night time ride and see Brisbane in lights.",
          "You certainly get a good view from up the top. You can also buy a drink and have it as your going around. Air con for summer which is good! Line tends to go down fast. A must if in Brisbane great for kids.",
          "This is a great safe family friendly attraction for day or night. With an airconditioned gondola and a radio going pointing out directions and information about local land marks and attractions the wheel is great at night or day. We went at night keen too see all the lights it",
          "The wheel is a great attraction with amazing views of Brisbane. I enjoyed it and would go on it again.",
          "The wheel was worth trying. It was $21 for an adult ticket. The wheel is scheduled for a 10-12 minute trip. There is pre recorded audio on board. I entered as a single person and was put in a pod on my own. I was not put in with other people or groups. I would say it holds 4",
          "For visitors & Aussies alike to South Bank take time out from the busy rush of life & relax and enjoy the peaceful wheel of Brisbane. For the very young & the seniors it is a breeze to ride. Young adults will love the option of a Wheel photo book of memories. Set close to coffee",
          "This has become an icon whenever someone mentions Brisbane this is usually mentioned not only as a must do but as a central location",
          "I am in love with the Wheel of Brisbane! The view at night time from the top of the Ferris wheel is absolutely stunning with all the city lights reflecting on the Brisbane river! My now boyfriend and I went on it last weekend and he asked me to be his girlfriend at the top of",
          "A great view of the CBD skyline & the Brisbane River is what this big wheel offers during the ride which lasts about 15 minutes for about four spins with also a pre-recorded audio commentary to listen to about the city (things like its history and about the areas in & around the",
          "Why not? This is a 'must do' for all visitors to Brisbane. The views from any point on the wheel are breathtakingly amazing. The commentary provided adds to the experience informing travellers of local history & points of interest. My only comment would be to slow down the pace",
          "Our kids wanted to ride the ferry wheel, so we took the advantage to hopp in as there have not been too many people waiting in front of it. We (4 persons) had one cabin for our own. Inside of the cabin there is a aircondition (which is surely good in summer times) and you will",
          "Went there at night and were the last entry. You can control your cabin air conditioning as well as lights which was good. It has a good view around and the explanation of our bearings through the recording were a plus. The only downside for me was the wheel was spinning a",
          "It cost around $40 for one adult and one child. Had to wait for a while, then the ride was a bit longer than expected. Good fun for all involved!",
          "This is a great, fun, well priced activity. Great way to see Brissy when time is limited. Love that there is rarely a long wait.",
          "We were in Brisbane for 4 days and we checked out southbank on one of the days we had lunch over there and we walked passed the wheel and decided to go for a ride and have a look would recommend this to people to do. The photos taken were great as well.",
          "It is really cool and only 20.00. It's right beside the BRISBANE sign which is a cool picture too. It's also beside the cultural district and the parking is super cheap there at 17.00 a day.",
          "Quite good experience but far from spectacular. The views are not outstanding but it is expensive for what you get... probably the same as I got from my hotel rooftop. I would rather spend an hour & half on one of the River Cruises.",
          "The wheel of Brisbane took me by surprise I went up and I could see for what looked like forever. It was amazing in every single way ! The view was outstanding and really made me think \ud83d\udcad WOW Brisbane is such a buzz. I definitely recommend it",
          "Lovely experience to see Brisbane at night. Definitely worth the money as you go round at least three times. I will definitely be doing this again in the day to see a different side to Brisbane.",
          "My 8 yr old Son and y Husband, really enjoyed going on this. It was a lengthy amount of time actually on it, and they got some awesome photos....",
          "Finally gave in to the pester power and took the kids on the wheel - we loved it! Great perspective on our home town and a real thrill for the littlies to get up on high. Would definitely take visitors here.",
          "This was pretty cool and while it was with teenagers little kids would feel very safe on this .. photo after wards was a nice keepsake",
          "Best to get on right before sunset. A nice view over south banks. Patronised the photo service booth but unfortunately the photos are unable to be downloaded from their website and not resolved after emailing. Summary, a nice place to visit and spend time but poor service",
          "In my opinion this is a romantic plan which I love it. The best thing is the audio explanation about everything you are seeing when you are on the top. It was a lovely experience. I\u2019ll do it again with my parents next time!",
          "The ride goes for 12 minutes and is $20. A little expensive for what it offers. It\u2019s not as good as the Melbourne Star or the Singapore version. Worth a look if you want a good view. Air conditioning is provided in the actual car. Waiting after purchasing a ticket in the sun was",
          "The Wheel of Brisbane is worth the ticket price, the ride was a good length of time for what you pay, and the views really are great! We were glad that we made a last minute decision to jump on and give it a go! Definitely memorable",
          "I enjoyed this, the ride was a nice length and you are able to control the temp in the cab, I\u2019m from Brisbane and it was good but I think the kids and tourists would enjoy this a lot more then a local especially at night. Also after the ride there is plenty to do around you at",
          "Title sums it up. Reasonably priced and 4 loops gave ample opportunity to see Brisbane from above. The picnic packs are awesome too",
          "I went on a ride during September. I managed to pick a really quiet time, so was able to get a carriage to myself. It was a good way to get my bearings of the town, for a good price.",
          "We were traveling with friends down under and decides to ride the wheel at night to see the beautiful lights of Brisbane. My husband asked if there was a senior discount, and the clerk said there was even though its not posted! So if you're mature ask and save $6 per ticket.",
          "It was great to take kids up on the school holidays. Views are good from the top - but it is only a small wheel by comparison with others around the world. Quite expensive for a family group but with cabins taking a maximum of 6, if you have 4 or more, you will likely get a",
          "Nice view in a quiet cabin to share with your loved one or your family. 7 turns and a relaxed atmosphere. You can see most of the south side of Brissie and part of the city.",
          "Is there much to see when you\u2019re on the wheel? Not really besides what you can see from other vantage points, but it is a good way to while away some time in the afternoon.",

          "Went on the wheel of Brisbane with a group that included 4 adults and 4 children ranging from 11 months to 9 years. All went in one gondola, good fit not squishy. We went in the evening when the sun was setting, it was really beautiful. Brisbane has a really pretty city scape at",
          "This is great for a one off but just a little expensive really. Glad I did it once but wont be rushing back. Too expensive for families I feel.",
          "That's my name for it. What a lovely view and cool thing to do on the evening preferably. View over South Bank and the city. Price is a little expensive but quite probably worth it.",
          "It was beautiful and the ride went on longer than expected and gave plenty of time for a good look. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "a must do when visiting Brisbane great views & well located family loved the experience recommend a visit",
          "Went with low expectations, but very impressed. Around lunchtime, but queue was relatively short meaning only 10 minutes before boarding. We were the only 2 people in our gondola which was great. Whilst you rotate (around 5 loops & seemed higher than I thought it would be)",
          "This was my second time on the Wheel, and just like the first time, it was a very pleasant and enjoyable view of the Brisbane skyline. A must do on a clear day.",
          "We actually had a coupon deal for our ride on the wheel. It's a great way to start off the Saturday night fun. Only problem we had was it was a tad too short, would have enjoyed a few more rounds. We loved viewing the city lights from the top",
          "I only went on this because my partner wanted to, I'm scared of heights. But when Iopened my eyes it was a great view, we went on at night. Informative commentary while on the wheel. Reasonably priced.",
          "The 60 metre tall Wheel is part of the attraction of the Brisbane riverside. It\u2019s there mostly for riders to view Brisbane night and day but it\u2019s a top view itself. At night it sparkles.",
          "I think this is more impressive to look at than to look from. We picked up some tickets off a group buying app. The experience is OK - not the view of London so kids got bored after a few times around. Don\u2019t need to go again.",
          "What a beaut way to see the Brisbane City at night all lit up in it's glory. Totally loved the Wheel, we were so lucky to manage to have the carriage to ourselves. Which was romantic & so peaceful. It has perfect timing, you're not whizzing around & you're also not going",
          "It's just 'OK'. Only views are of the river sides N-S, City views aren't much different from the ground and west is blocked by buildings as well. It's a good outing for young kids.",
          "When I went It expensive, underwelming and not really worth it, I felt a bit like it could have spun for less times.",
          "Visited wheel in evening and lights at night were amazing. Could see for miles. Enclosed carriages included guided tour through speakers of places of interest although found hard to hear at times. Need the map that is supplied to help follow.",
          "Staff were friendly and helpful. You are on for 12 minutes and go around 4 or 5 times. You have an exceptional view of the city. Great location in Southbank!",
          "Enjoyed my ride on the wheel of Brisbane. I'm a little scared of heights, but coped with this okay. It had an informative recording of Brisbane in the cabin when the ride started.",
          "Beautiful views of the Brisbane River, Southbank Parklands and surrounds. This is definitely a must do experience however a little costly if on a family budget.",
          "The view was so amazing that I road the wheel twice. The gondolas are air conditioned and the sights are narrated so you can identify the buildings and structures as they come into view. My wife is normally height sensitive but was quite comfortable during the ride. It was worth",
          "Been on the Wheel of Brisbane twice. Once with family and once with my partner. On one occasion it was during the day and the other at night. Completely different, but equally as good. Short queues - would buy on Groupon or Cudo for discounts. Lovely.",
          "My kids are very enjoy the ride as we can see the night scenery of Brisbane and they are very excited on the wheel ride",
          "Get a discount voucher and visit around dusk. You'll get the daytime nighttime experience well sorta.",
          "This is considered to be one of Brisbane's must see attractions. It is a good way of exploring the views of Brisbane city and afterwards walk around and explore the southbank area.",
          "Short visit to the Wheel of Brisbane price is reasonable with a great view. It's better to go at night time when the city and bridges lights lit up.",
          "Great activity for me and older teenage grandchildren. Reasonably priced and the team were great. You can even get a photo of the occasion. A must for anyone visiting Brisbane.",
          "Well if you go on top, you get birds eye view of the city. I would not say this absolute must, but it is fun.",

          "Good for families and couples, use coupon (Groupon) to get discount, its slow paced so can view the river, city and sounthbank.",
          "Really enjoyed this attraction with the younger lad in the afternoon yesterday. Well priced but I had a coupon so it's difficult to be sure about whether I was just lucky. Even so at full prices it would be worth it. Efficient and friendly staff with the young man up on the",
          "See our Brisbane on the Rid of your life, it's something you must do, a breath taking look at our city, take the whole family, you will be amazed and what a loverly view you will get of what we have on offer here in this big county town, but this is not for people scared of",
          "I really recommend to go there during night I think city is more nice with lots of light. For me it was not very interesting, during first turn I was so happay but after second turn it was boring.",
          "Went on the wheel last year in daytime, this year was by night and was way more spectacular. There were celebrations for Buddha\u2019s Birthday, so was very colourful as you went round. A must do and South Bank rocks at night!",
          "Recently my daughter and I took a ride on the Wheel of Brisbane and loved it. This was a lovely way to end an evening at South Bank. We did this on a weeknight and were there around 8:00 pm. It was not busy and therefore we had a gondola to ourselves. Although my daughter is",
          "Really nice touristy thing to do. Use the Groupon deal for $12 and don\u2019t pay ticket price of $20 as it\u2019s not worth that.",
          "A great view over South Bank area & beyond. A superb way to finish off the evening, after the Ballet or theatre at QPAC as we did. RACQ offered a special rate for pre-purchase of tickets - Check it out!",
          "The Brisbane Wheel,is a must do. Although I'm not into Ferris wheels and height type rides, this was comfortable, non 'threatening' and the views were fantastic. The audio commentary is very good and informative, and you can get a drink to take onboard with you, for a",
          "An icon and nice ride. It's short and gives you some history while you are way up top and can see all of Brisbane! Worth the $$.",
          "I work in disabilities and had the wonderful opportunity to take my client who has cerabyl palsy - there were no problems at all staff were awesome and helped where needed to make our day awesome. I don\u2019t like heights but it went well nothing to be concerned over. I did take",
          "This is the sort of tourist trap that I usually avoid. On this occasion I was pleased with the experience. It was not too expensive, we got three trips around the wheel, the commentary ant the pamphlet were interesting, and the whole experience gave me a view of the city which",
          "Came here before taking the city cat down the river at sunset. Picture perfect great views highly recommended",
          "We took this and bought the little bottles of wine to enjoy on our trip. You get to do four rotations, which takes about 15 minutes. It is safe with extremely high quality equipment. They give you a nice handout and broadcast over the speaker what you are seeing.",
          "This was a quick last minute decision to do before I left to the airport and it was fabulous. The sun was setting and lights were on the city so the bridge was glowing and the river looked amazing. Great sights. I'd like to do it in the day time also to see the difference in how",
          "Went on the Wheel of Brisbane to see Brisbane in a different perspective. This ride is 12 minutes in total. The views are simply breathtaking, you can see everything which is lovely \ud83d\ude0a. I would go on this either during the day or night. Each gondola is air conditioned and",
          "Understanding Brisbane is easier when you see it from above. Then you realize that many nice spots to visit are close. That\u2019s why I strongly suggest to visit the Wheel at first.",
          "The wheel was a nice little activity that we did on a spur if the moment activity while passing through southbank. You get to go round the wheel a couple of times although I'm not sure the views are really worth the price",
          "We did this simply so we could say that we've done it. The kids enjoyed it. We were fortunate that we had an Entertainment Book coupon which provided 50% off. For the price we may not have gone on it if we had to pay full price.",
          "The Wheel of Brisbane is located in South Bank Parklands. Just a short stroll from the city. Great views from Air Conditioned gondolas. Well worth the visit.",
          "Good for all ages the pods are air conditioned and fully enclosed, At the top you are sitting high so wouldn't do if scared of heights.Photo at start is worth checking out on exit for purchase.",
          "We had fun on the wheel of Brisbane. Although it is something you would only do once and I would never pay full price. We had half price tickets from Groupon.",
          "Cheaper to book on-line and not too long a wait to board. There is a commentary and you go round more than once so you can see the different areas pointed out in the commentary. Cabin clean, but difficult to turn to see everything.",
          "Went on this as a family of 4. Good views of Brisbane River and surroundings. The pods have air conditioning and a running commentary on the sites etc. Not to the scale of the London Eye (if you've had the change to visit) but worth hopping on. Only had to wait around 5",
          "My Daughter and to have been lucky enough to experience this wonderful wheel a number of times and the difference between night and day makes it worth while (experiencing both.) The wheel gives a very informative speech regarding Brisbane history along with the surrounding",
          "Firstly I am a bit scared of heights but these gondolas made me feel fine even as we went up and around multiple times. They are air conditioned and have a sound track telling you all the things in the distance of importance. Not sure how many times we went around but the ride",
          "We live locally and had never been on the wheel of Brisbane before - it was truly spectacular! The views were to die for, it was a nice clear day so you had views all around the city. The gondolas are air conditioned and there is a voice recording which plays to help you",
          "Unlike the London Eye, which is an intrusion on the Thames Embankment, the Brisbane Wheel is an integral element of the elegant and dynamic precinct which includes theatre, concert, museum and gallery facilities adjacent to Parklands recreation complex. Intruiging in daylight,",
          "Staff very helpful as we had a disabled person with us. Only 12 minutes but a good view over the city.",
          "The Ferris Wheel overlooks the Brisbane River & Southbank. It commands stunning views & is 60m tall & has 42 fully air conditioning gondolas. It was constructed in 2008 as part of the 20th anniversary of world expo 88. The wheel experience has a audio system that gives",
          "Worth a ride....value for money... $20 for 4 rotations....each three minutes...12 minutes..or longer if they are loading people. Enjoy a champagne...or just enjoy the view",
          "Touristy? Yes! Worth it ? Certainty. This was an pleasant surprise on a warm Brisbane evening. (No crowds, but excellent views). I liked the informative commentary.",
          "The wheel of brisbane is a greatly advertised attraction, though once on the wheel you dont get much more of a view of the city than you could get from walking over the bridge to south bank, the added bonus is you get to see what rooftops look like! It only cost me $12 which is",
          "New Years Eve they have a special event where you can watch the fireworks while having a sparkly wine way above the crowds. After dinner you can take a ride and enjoy the lights of Brisbane and feel transported into the night sky.",
          "a great way to see the Brisbane skyline, river vista and views to the mountains. We chose the VIP experience which is longer and you do not share a gondola - worth the extra $'s. Drinks and food are relatively expensive and you cannot take your own, so go to a bar first and fill",
          "My husband and I took a ride on the Brisbane Wheel on a Saturday night in March 2018. There was a short line up at about 7.30 but it was worth the wait. The commentary was interesting but the highlight was seeing the city lights and river reflections from overhead.We were also",
          "This was a great experience with huge views. Well organised. The only thing I found was the undercover parking costs which I think was a flat $15 for the day so no hourly rate. I left my car there for the day while walking across the bridge and exploring downtown Brisbane",
          "I thought at $20 this was ok value for money. You get a pretty good view and the commentary is good to give an idea of what Brisbane has to offer. The aircon inside the pods is a welcome relief on a hot day and for some would be the way to go for this reason alone.",
          "Coming from Melbourne we expected a lot more. The Melbourne Star is much higher and offers a much better view of Melbourne, for about the same price. The Wheel was somewhat informative, with an audio track pointing out the prominent landmarks of Brisbane, but it spins too fast",
          "The Wheel of Brisbane provides you with an awesome view of the city. It gives you a commentary pointing out places of interest. It is reasonbly priced and very safe-feeling",
          "London eye in Brisbane! Fun wheel - kids loved it. The views are really good and it is always a good fun to combine a bit of a sightseeing along with some fair. Recommend it!",
          "This iconic feature of South Bank is a really nice way to get a bird's eye look at the city. The views at night are breathtaking!",
          "Bit of fun had when the family and impromptly decided to give the wheel of brissy a run. The kids (age 6 + 7) got a real kick out of it.",
          "I enjoyed the ride and recommend it for locals and visitors. Excellent views but a bit expensive, I thought.",
          "We got a voucher from Groupon for 12.50$ instead of 20$ so we gave it a go. It\u2019s not amazing but it\u2019s not terrible either. Goes only for 10 minutes so quiet pricey when you pay the full price",
          "Awesome view, in the cabins for approx 10 mins, air con is a bonus. Recommend giving it a go if never tried as this was my first time.",
          "Great views and good comentary as you ride. Quite expensive in relation to other things but a nice way to get good photos",
          "The Wheel of Brisbane offers a great view of the city. Located in Southbank, it is very easy to get to and hard to miss! I went on it with some friends at night time so we took some pictures. I would say it's worth going on once in my life. It's not something I would put on my",
          "Great views of Brisbane and the river from the wheel at South Bank. Easy situated at South Bank with access from the ferries",
          "Nothing special and quite dear for what you get, nice and cool inside though and views pretty good and doubt we would come back again.",
          "Expensive 12 minute ride with 35A$ extra for the photos but it has to be done. Good views and informative in car commentary helped",
          "It's a nice view and not overly expensive, but does get a little boring quite quickly. May suggest getting more than one drink as I finished mine before even getting on the wheel",
          "Something worth doing with family and friends visiting Brisbane. Great views and interesting commentary",
          "Nothing else like it in QLD so is well worth it to spend some time going around on the big wheel. Has in depth narration of areas and views that you can see from the carriages and is a nice air conditioned car so great for any climate",
          "It\u2019s nice and pleasant enough to get to the top of the wheel and see the green river and look for the man-made beach. Brisbane is a lovely city to look at from the height. But turning around and around for five times with the same view? It can get boring. Not sure if it is worth",
          "Nice views of Brisbane, Not fast or scary. Good for anyone not scarred of heights. See the surrounding parklands when you visit the wheel. Check groupon for discounts before you go on the wheel.",
          "Not nearly as big as something like the London Eye but a nice clean newish way to see the evolving Brisbane skyline. The part of town is also close to lots of great restaurants and bars and right by the \u201cBrisbane\u201d sign. Try it at sunset!",
          "I loved the wheel of Brisbane and the view was breathtaking seeing of Southbank and Brisbane River I would recommend it to anyone",
          "Beautiful view of Brisbane very enjoyable ride friends really loved it they were from Tasmania so great time looking around",
          "Took a friend to Southbank to see the Christmas markets. She had only just moved to Brisbane and it was her first visit to Southbank - she is now a regular!",
          "This is something everyone visiting Brisbane shoud do. It is 60 metres high and you can see everything from up here. Great audio helps you locate specific landmarks. Highly recommend",
          "We did not find the time to partake in going up in the Wheel of Brisbane, but lots of people were enjoying the ride. It is a beautiful city Icon both in the day but especially at night when it is lit up. Definite worth a site to see and photograph.",
          "Great way to explore Brisbane, with good views, from the wheel, seeing the landscape and interesting places.",
          "A good view from the top and a nice way to see the city but it does not compare with the London Eye or the Docklands Eye in Melbourne",
          "Took my wife and grandkids Best thing in Brisbane Kids loved it, even found a water lizard to photograph View at night is spectacular Look for deals online for pricing We got 4 people for $45.00 A bargain",
          "The Wheel isn't high enough to see the full expanse of the view, but still worth a visit while wandering along the river on the way to the museum.",
          "The price is too high ($57 for family ) for ten minutes ride. Also $35 for photo memories is ok but it is look very fake. If possible, I want to return it. Need to improve the price and photo memories. Except that everything is good. Go to buy ticket with Groupon will cheaper.",
          "Don't miss out taking in all the wonderful beauty that Brisbane has to offer. We suggest you go in the morning for no lines and then come back right before sunset to take in the views of the city skyline. Used the Groupon for admission!",
          "My sister was over visiting and handing been on one of these previously, Brisbane is such a pretty city and the views spectacularly, worth doing",
          "We went on the wheel after dinner and enjoyed the view and the ride. It's walking distance from the CBD.",
          "With a wife scared of heights I knew this could be interesting. But after a few rotations even she started to enjoy the experience. Great set up with air conditioning and narration sharing a bit of local history and pointing out the sights. Highly recommend at night too as",
          "Lovely views over the city and environs with interesting commentary. Air conditioning cabins are very welcome especially in our Summer months. I enjoyed it even as a local, but the prices are expensive. Look online for deals on tickets where you can usually buy them much cheaper",
          "Fantastic views and great AC in the bubble. Take the family on this ride as well worth it. Kids were a little nervous at first but quickly found there feet. May need to review the talk about Brisbane whilst in the bubble.",
          "Great, I enjoyed the views. Very informative and good information while going around. Did think that the prices are a bit over the top tho. Probably wouldn't go on it again.",
          "Love the wheel of Brisbane, kids love it. It\u2019s fun scaring your children pretending the gondolas are going to drop off and some how land in the river. Beautiful at night seeing the city lights.",
          "You go around in a circle a couple of times and you see the city from a high top view. Worth it if you're a tourist and you have twenty minutes and a few dollars to use up.",
          "Ferris wheels are always a tiny bit of fun. Nothing special with this one though, scenic views of the city, a dirty river. Southbank parkland is close and there are quite a few nice restaurants so I would definitely make a day of it if you plan to go. Around $15 per adult so",
          "Very friendly staff, comfortable seating, feel safe and amazing view. Excellent commentary and a family fun thing to do.",
          "I recommend going at night, I doubt I would have enjoyed it as much if it were during the day we chose to ride. The ticket prices are very steep, we managed to use our Google experience to find cheap coupons to get money off this. The photos they ask also are not worth the $40",
          "Mediocrity embodied here in this \u201c Me Too \u201c wheel. Totally in place for Brisbane, a city utterly devoid of the original, the novel or the truly inspirational. This wheel offers no better view than many of the suburban streets and terraces that surround the centre.",
          "$20 per adult, $14 for child, and under 3 was free (which tipped the scale for us going). Quite expensive for 4-5 rotations (lost count as we were enjoying the experience). We enjoyed the view, and the air conditioning, but won't be doing it again. I felt the prices were above",
          "Amazing view of the surrounding area ~ didn't expect to go around 5 times so time to take lots of photos. It is much smaller than the wheel in London & Vegas but worth the ride. Relaxing and best of all - air conditioned ! Recommend giving it a try.",
          "Something to do in Brisbane . Not too expensive and you get a great view. There is a commentary and the booths are air conditioned. But small so watch you head on exit. You get 4 trips round and can see for miles. Doesn\u2019t last all that long however, about 15 mins max",
          "The Wheel is not that huge as compared to many Wheels around the world but offers a great experience for a good ride. You not only get a good view of the city sky line but also enjoy the beauty of Brisbane River.",
          "We had done a lot of walking and wanted to take a break. There was no line at the Wheel so we gave it a go. You get 12 minutes which translates to five revolutions, so there are multiple opportunities to see various views of Brisbane. It is a nice city so that is good, but",
          "I think I might have a skewed view as our hotel room is on the 70th floor...so the view from the wheel was less than amazing from my point of view...that said...we got to the wheel early, (as it opened)...short line and the boy and I enjoyed a \"car\" of our own...the boy was",

          "Pretty good attraction. The day we went it was hot and humid. The air conditioning in the carriages is excellent and was a nice reprieve from the heat outside. The information over the radio was also very informative. I don't think it was too expensive, everything costs a bit of",
          "The family went on the wheel while in City. Great view from the top. A great photo opportunity to see Brisbane river and skyline. Well worth a look if you are in Southbank Parklands.",

          "The kids loved the wheel and the staff were nice, but to the adults it was just another wheel. Like the Melbourne Star or the London Eye - but not nearly as high! The carriages were air conditioned and well ventilated in the Brisbane sun, but really there isn't too much as to",
          "Observation wheels are a normal sight for big cities and this was no surprise that Brisbane has it too. But we get our money's worth by enjoying spectacular views of the city. It did 5 rounds for us and we found ample time to both enjoy the views and click great photos. Must",

          "While travelling down the Brisbane River on the City Cat I viewed it during the afternoon. At night while returning the same way it was spectacular when all illuminated. Being afraid of heights I declined the view from above.",
          "Wasn\u2019t the best experience although have been on the London eye before so maybe I\u2019m comparing it ?? Pretty costly and also the wheel moves around a bit faster than I think it should (you go around a few times) but you don\u2019t get to see as much. Would do it once but once only",

          "Wow went in the day the views amazing and able to get some great shots. Would live to go at night too",
          "Comfortable air conditioned cabins slowly spin you round as you take in the sights of the city, with audio commentaries of the important landmarks. At its highest point, one gets a truly magnificienr view of a large portion of the city. Official photos of your visit are",
          "Great time going slowly around in the wheel. Seeing Brisbane from this position shows just how big it is. View it at night is awesome as the lights across the city are amazing.",
          "Money well spent for a great view. Air conditioned with audio and friendly staff. Value for money with ample time for photos etc.",
          "Not the best of views and the trips is quite longed out, you go around about 5 times to see the same thing.",
          "Great views. Spotlessly Clean. Very good experience. Thoroughly recommend the ride. Need to make a decision on the time of the day as the City\u2019s night lights kick in.",
          "My daughter and husband went specifically to Southbank last night to go on the wheel for the first time - parked at QPAC paying $16 for that. Walked to the Wheel and it was closed at 8pm. Nothing on Website about being closed - only a reference to when they were closed for",
          "I enjoyed this ride by day, and I was surprised that you get enough spins around to feel like you've taken it all in. I enjoyed it so much, I came back for a nighttime ride which is quite lovely too!",
          "The views are great during the day but just as nice at night. Great Engineering marvel. It is not scarry like a ferris wheel",
          "A must do in every city! Get view and good for photo's but the southbank presence is also great to do and have lunch after. Worth it \ud83d\udc41",
          "A fun thing to do for all family members. I took my experience by night. Wonderful to see Brisbane and surrounds by night,the lovely night lights.",
          "We had a long stopover in Brisbane on the way to Airlie Beach so we decided to explore Brisbane. We came across the wheel of Brisbane and had to go on. I had been on Ferris wheels like the London eye and the Singapore flyer so I was interested to see how this one compared. The",
          "We saw this on the 1st night and knew we had to go on. Far probably not the best idea.....Forgot I was afraid of heights and when it moved it freaked me out hahahaha at 48 maybe it's not the best move. We went up at night it was beautiful seeing all the lights and realising how",
          "They were very accommodating of my wheelchair. The view is spectacular. We had a Gondola to ourselves. Well worth $40.",
          "Arrived in Brisbane and walked along the river to find the Wheel, Had to see it, worth the $20.00 AUD each. No line up on a Thursday at 4 pm so no waiting, rotate 3 times and get a commentary from the located areas on the map you receive so you know what you are looking at!",
          "Went on the Brisbane wheel and had great views. Cost $35 per person and went around about five times with audio telling you about different places. You have a photo at beginning which are ready when you finish. Optional to buy. Enjoyable",
          "Being a Brisbane resident, i thought it was time to go on the wheel. We had group on vouchers which made it cheaper and we were really surprised how good it was. Got to go around a few times and went on a lovely day which helped. Worth going on.",
          "While walking back from the city beach to the city centre, we took a last minute decision to try the wheel. Excellently priced and no queue either !! Staff all polite and helpful. Unlike the London Eye, you go round several times so get chance to take plenty of photos.",
          "We went on this at night and the view was incredible. An added bonus was being able to buy some booze for the trip. This is a must when you are at South Bank.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our ride on the eye. Although we had to wait a few minutes, the staff member showed us to an area where we could sit. The ride itself has a map with a commentary to show the sights. Recommended.",
          "BIG, interesting, fun for kids and families, but also for couples, I was there with my husband on our honeymoon. To recommend!",
          "Have been on this a few times it is fantastic for young kids or visitors to the city. I use the groupon voucher as it's a good price and then allows us to get the photo if we have kids with us",
          "I expected more, but was worth going. You can buy small drinks to consume inside, it is usually not crowded so it is a nice place for a date or a special moment. The view is really nice, but nothing that you could not see from a building.",
          "No queue nice wee view of the city however when staying on the 42nd floor of hotel the wheel seemed tidy. Nice and clean cars friendly staff..people trying to sell you stupid photos were a pain and spoilt our visit",
          "Petty much what you would expect from a ferris wheel. Limited views of the Southbank area and that section of the Brisbane river, just from a higher position. Nothing that you can't see anyway. The enclosed air-conditioned cars are comfortable but you just don't get that feeling",
          "Although this is an attraction which is good value for money (in comparison to the London Eye, for example!), I think it could be improved! I find it difficult, even with a site map in front of me, to actually work out where things are (maybe it's just me?) Anyway, would it be",
          "We took my aunt and uncle on this ferris wheel when they came for a whirl wind trip to Brisbane. We had a couple of promo 2-for-1 tickets so it was really very cheap. If paying full price, it would still be worth doing. We went at night after an after-dinner stroll along the",
          "My husband and I hopped on the Wheel of Brisbane for a night time activity. I highly recommend this. Great views and an asset for Brisbane. Great to walk around South Bank afterwards also. Well worth the money.",
          "If you are in Brisbane and have the time to travel to Southbank I would fully recommend going on the Brisbane Wheel, allowing you to see the city in a different light and to see the incredible scenery and views of Brisbane city.",
          "This ferris wheel can be seen along the south bank park, especially at night, when it is lit up. II was there watching it during the day....a note for the operators, I saw maybe 1 or 2 people on the wheel, each time I walked by. $20/person is a lot of money, and all but one or 2",
          "This is a must do in Brisbane at Southbank, at least once! There are always deals on Groupon or Scoopon or even in the Entertainment Book so I don't recommend you pay full price! It's lovely to view it from afar as it adds to the Brisbane skyline, but it's even better to be in",
          "Absolutely phenomenal way to view Brisbane! Definitely a must-do activity The gondolas were very comfortable, and didn't feel at all claustrophobic Staff were very friendly and helpful",
          "Spent an enjoyable 30 minutes, or whatever the ride took. Interesting to see Brisbane from this height. My guests were delighted",
          "The ride will allow you to have a bird view on the city of brisbane. If you want to have clear nice view, come in the afternoon. Went on the ride when the wind is quite strong, still feel safe though very shaky ride. They have naration/voice over thruout the ride. They will",
          "The eye gives a great view of the city and is accompanied by a tutorial of the surroundings. There are a few scary sounds but if you can get past that ots a great way to spend 10-15 mins.",
          "It was nice a quiet when we were at the wheel so we didnt have to wait in line. The wheel goes around 4 or 5 times. Plenty of time for photos. Three people in my group bought the souvenir photo booklets, so we got a discount. I think it worked out to be $30 each.",
          "By day or night this is a must for those who can't afford a fly over but want a vivid view of beautiful Brisbane. We took a mini bottle of bubbles to toast our anniversary weekend and clinked glasses high over the Brisbane River!! Well worth it especially with a groupon",
          "We go here every time we come to Brisbane. My 4yo loves the wheel. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s air conditioned. The view is constantly changing. Tip - try RACQ or a site like groupon for discounted tickets.",
          "Amazing views, great tourist spot, clean & well presented, pictures and fact book on Brisbane extra. Add-ons to buy extra pics of yourself. A great informative Brisbane attraction.",
          "Went during the early evening- was beautiful. Didn't have to wait long (5 mins). Made 5 rotations (20 mins) Had a wine on the ride ... a nice touch. Enjoyed it",
          "This wheel does five reasonably brisk revolutions, unlike some others that do one really slow trip, but it doesn't feel rushed. Plenty of opportunity to catch the views and take photos. The booths are air conditioned and comfy.",
          "12 minute ride gives you good 360 degree views of Brisbane and little bit beyond. If you buy tickets at the wheel cost $20/= check online tickets for lower prices. We check Groupon and found $12/= tickets while we were there.",
          "I have been on the wheel a few times and can only recommend it. And the best time is at night, seeing the lit up city from above. Better even, try to do it during the Brisbane Festival to enjoy the special colours and lightings at that time.",
          "Lovely views of Brisbane with an educational commentary inside an air-conditioned gondola. Beautiful, informative, and comfortable! Highly recommend.",
          "Its a great thing to do for fun and its best at night , been twice , a bit ott price wise , the view of south bank and the city is excellent",
          "Great views can be enjoyed along with commentary.Good way to learn about the surroundings.Very lively place in the evening.",
          "We enjoyed our time on the wheel - it was a very hot day so having air conditioning inside the gondolas was a bonus. Both kids enjoyed it, as did us adults.",
          "Excellent speaker commentary as the wheel turns .. great for those who are visiting Brisbane and for longerm locals",
          "This is the best place for seeing the beauty of Brisbane city! When you reach the top, you will be grateful to visit Brisbane. I wonder if I could make a proposal to my significant other here. But only wondering tho.",
          "First of all, I LOATHE ferris wheels. However, I am glad I was talked into going on this one. There was no rocking or wobbling, which was great since I hate that. The views were just awesome! We spotted a couple more places we wanted to visit as we were riding the wheel.",
          "Really enjoyed the experience. As a gift from family, we were treaded to the VIP car with a platter and some wine. This really made the experience very special.",
          "I drew up my courage and went solo on the Brisbane Wheel. But boy was I glad I did. The views when I went (just after dusk) gave a great glow across the city. I had the advantage that I sat on both sides of my gondola and we completed serval loops. For a unique perspective",
          "Although I thought it was a bit expensive for a family of 4, it was certainly an interesting and in some ways exciting ride. Don't do it if you don't like heights (obviously), but it was (and looks) very solid and safe. It has aircon in each of the carriages, so it was also",
          "We only went at night, but all the stories they tell and ask you to look at is not that easy to see when it is dark. But it is very beautiful to see the city that way.",
          "The Wheel of Brisbane was an unexpected surprise. Not being fond of such rides, I was delighted to discover that I hardly noticed the Wheel moving. We were thrilled by the uninterrrupted view of Brisbane and by the fact that the Wheel completed two revolutions."

          "The price are reasonable so I'm happy with it,  I ride alone cause I don't have friends. However the detail and information given while riding were meaningful and make me understand more of Brisbane and the history of it. I hope I can ride it next time when I'm a student. The staffs are friendly and kind.",
          "This was good fun, we had a great photo  taken also",
          "Have a good view of city from The Wheel of Brisbane.",
          "It\u2019s not worth AUD20+ for a 10 mins ride up there. Firstly, the whole ride was spinning rather quick. Also if you\u2019re looking to take bird-eye view photo, you\u2019ll notice the windows are too dirty for you to do so. It\u2019s also especially reflective, so you can\u2019t capture nice pictures. \nJust take photo of the wheel itself, don\u2019t go in",
          "Looks beautiful from the ground at night time but once up on the ride it was pretty disappointing, the glass was so scratched and dirty it was hard to see from and taking photos were impossible due to this.\nApart from that it's beautifully lit up at night time right next to the water.",
          "Very nice view and shape.",
          "Awesome view,  would be even better with the beverage packages they offer.",
          "This is the kind of thing you'd want to ride at least once. It gives unique perspective of the city and is great for taking photos. Despite how nice of a view you get on the wheel, the price may be a bit steep for those on a budget.  Not recommended for anyone with a fear of heights.",
          "Better to go at night. Secure & safe. My mum of 73yrs old like it too. See the city from the sky. Staff was very friendly with big smile. A pleasant experience.",
          "Highly recommended. Air-conditioned wheel cabins with spectacular 360-degree views to the brisbane.",
          "Great for photos! Offers a unique perspective on Brisbane!",
          "The place is amazing. You get to a 360 degree view of Brisbane CBD. The introduction is quite informative with a run down of brief history of the City. The view is very scenic and refreshing. It is located close to the Brisbane River which \u2026",
          "Thank you for having a happy time. The staff is also kind.",
          "Must watch in brisbane.Good spot for photos in day as well as night",
          "Get a voucher to lessen the price. Great views of brisbane.",
          "Amazing view of Brisbane. Try and use Groupon for a nice discount.",
          "Friendly staff.  Great views.  Good value for money",
          "Amazing view of River while sitting in Wheel of Brisbane",
          "Not the highest view of Brisbane, but It's worth the experience. Try to catch a nice sunset or visit when we're having any event @ SouthBank, so you can see it from above!",
          "Wow  its a very pleasant ride .in air conditioned  comfort  the  view is awsone a must do when in Brisbane  youll love it",
          "Wasn't sure we would ever try out taking a ride on The Wheel of Brisbane, but now that we finally have, I have no regrets at all. There is some in-gondola commentary that plays over the speakers, which is interesting. And after this ends, \u2026",
          "A good way to enjoy the evening, amazing sunset! Beautiful views of the city. \nIt's worth has a tourist, around $50 dollars for a couple. It takes about 8 - 10 minutes for 3 rounds and if you wanted, can purchase something to drink during the ride for another couple of dollars. Recommended!",
          "A lot more fun than I thought it would be :)",
          "Great place to visit. We've done this ride both at sunset, which is beautiful, and when it was dark, when you can see all the lights. Both times we're good and took around 15 minutes.",
          "Great thing to try once. Bit expensive.",
          "Good ride. Bring some window cleaner to clean the glass to get some good shots. You have 5 rounds. Make use of it",
          "A good experience to have good 360 degree view of Brisbane. Not for the faint hearted though. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Awesome staff, great views and quick lines. Has a beautiful fountain out the front. Prices are honestly reasonable.",
          "We got to see the first half of the Australia day fireworks. It was amazing!!!",
          "Great thing to do in Brisbane, easy to access from public transport. Depending on the time of day the lines can be quite long and the ride can seem a bit overpriced unless you use Groupon or one of the other tickets. Ride times are variable but are around 15 minutes. Depending on how many need to get on/off.",
          "Was a nice experience. Would have been nice if higher and spins a bit too fast. A slower pace like vegas or london allow you to take in more views",
          "Such a great place to go with family or visitors... you get a great view of the whole city!",
          "Fun and educational ride to witness the scenic beauty of Brisbane covering 5 rounds",
          "Great views although a bit pricey. I have been at night and during the day, personally I believe the night to be a better time to go but it really depends on what you want to see. Historical buildings vs LED's and colourful lights across various bridges and buildings.",
          "Really lovely. Great view! Nice with the aircon!! \ud83d\ude04",
          "It\u2019s a fun experience and the views are decent but it\u2019s way overpriced for what it is. If it wasn\u2019t so expensive we would go on it a lot more.",
          "Good view, bit pricey though.",
          "Brilliant views at night. Absolutely beautiful skyline. Recommend 5 stars",
          "The place is amazing. You get to a 360 degree view of Brisbane CBD. The introduction is quite informative with a run down of brief history of the City. The view is very scenic and refreshing",
          "It called \u0930\u094b\u091f\u0947 \u092a\u0940\u0919 (Rote Ping ) in my country.\nNice place to visit",
          "Always wanted to go on this Ferris Wheel and finally last weekend we did. We were surprised at the amount of times we went around - we thought maybe two, three at the max but we got five. Staff were friendly and the view was very nice. Prices are 'touristy' but how often are you there? Just pay for the experience  :)",
          "Obviously, you're not obligated to purchase the last two add ons.  When we visited, we were given a pass for our group to return for another free ride that night.  Not sure if this is normally offered.We really enjoyed looking around \u2026",
          "Nice addition to Brissy! Looks cool in the dark",
          "Nice experience with family, especially if you have young kids, they would enjoy this. Thankfully it is air conditioned. Did around 5 rotations of the wheel, so it was a decent length of time.",
          "Nice and gentle movements for those who are afraid of heights.  You can see the CBD clearly from the top. You do about 4 to 5 rotations. They take photos before you leave and sting you almost $50 for a few photos in a little booklet. It's alright I guess if you are a tourist. I give it 4 starts.",
          "Stopped in the Southbank to grab a few shots on the new camera... nice area.",
          "Enjoyed this! You get pretty high up and will be able to see quite a nice view over Brisbane. In my opinion the price isn't too bad, but the ride is a bit short. There was actually a bigger line when we did the ride in the evening compared \u2026",
          "We loved the wheel of Brisbane experience! It is always a thrill every time you go! Not only do you get to see the Beautiful Brisbane skyline and take some amazing pictures and videos but the whole experience is informative and fun. At the \u2026",
          "Good location but cannot see anything from the top",
          "Great view of the city and the wheel spinner multiple times. You also get to stop at the top of the wheel to be able to take in the full view",
          "Great views,  great fun, ample time, well priced but the company who runs it should clean the windows! We couldn't take a decent picture because the window ss were so filthy",
          "Great experience, well worth the $22. Air conditioned carts with amazing views.",
          "Great!! Comfortably seated 6 adults and 2 kids.  Did about 3 rotations, or might've been 4, wasn't counting. Beautiful views.",
          "Best place to enjoy and see Brisbane from top",
          "Love it...very beautiful view from above. Price is reasonable.",
          "One of the best things to do in brisbane where you can see the overlooking brisbane especially at night.",
          "Good view, too expensive though. $22 per adult",
          "Great fun, fantastic views",
          "Good value and city view on sunny warm day.",
          "Great view of the city! Loved having a carriage to ourselves (middle of the day on a weekday)!",
          "Easy access. Friendly n helpful staff. Great views n options",
          "The view was ok nothing spectacular definitely a good experience for $15.",
          "Beautiful place. Amazing. Unforgettable. Fair prices and a incredible scenery. Brisbane is a lovely city. Good people. I have to return there. It's my dream to walk and explore those streets of Brisbane City again.",
          "A bit overpriced but for instagram lovers, this could be added to your photo album.",
          "Great view of Brisbane and a must for any tourist.",
          "It's a bit pricy for what it is and then they want additional money for lame greenscreen images. However, the views are fantastic",
          "Amazing views of Brisbane. Photo shots at the entrance is a good marketing idea, but quite expensive to purchase. \nStaff can be a little more friendly. \nPrices are reasonable - $20 per adult. Kids under the age of 2 walk in free.",
          "It was great!! Well worth the money. Will do it\nAgain at night.",
          "Good view. We did in total six spins. For me was awful because I'm scared of height,but all the people around me, enjoyed. Anyway it worth the price of the tickets that i bought half price on Groupon. So try to don't buy them at the entrance.",
          "Managed to get discounted tickets and it made it worth it! Great views, we went as the sun set and then got to see Brisbane light up. Didn't buy the pics, I've heard they are expensive.  Enjoyed it. Would go again and take the family",
          "Good fun and the kids liked it. Kids under 4 are free",
          "Never been on it because of the price, but it looks cool and pretty much a requirement for any Australian city it seems.\nWould have nice views though, as nice as the Brisbane River/city is at least.",
          "It's a Ferris Wheel. Not the best, but probably not the worst either. It's quite expensive.",
          "One of the most important thing to do when you visit Brisbane is to try The Wheel of Brisbane. To enjoy the seen, I recommend that you ride it in mornings or afternoons.",
          "Place i love to walk by with the love of my life at night time",
          "It's only ok because of the very high price they want to go on it.  If it were cheaper I'd rate higher.",
          "A \"must do\" for any visitor to Brisbane. Great views up and down the river,  the city and surrounding Southbank precinct. Friendly and helpful staff assist you with easy access to gondolas. The gondolas are air conditioned and have a good \u2026",
          "I've done this a few times with my daughter and she loves it. She always wants to do it again. It's a recommendation if you have kids",
          "Excellent. Not too expensive and no queues.",
          "Yippee. This was great fun. Not too expensive and a nice long slow ride around a few times to get a good view of the city and surrounds.  My daughter had a ball.",
          "Centrally located and could see all the major areas of the city. It is well maintained.",
          "Our boys favorite ferries wheel in QLD. Great place to take your visitors to see the whole city.",
          "Nice experience. Some BGM may have been good. Look first for discounts  on line. Probably best at night.",
          "Not a fan of heights but after first rotation i was fine, amazing view of the city and southbank, great for any friends new to the area.",
          "Efficient, good, though a bit fast, but that's why they provide 4 rounds. The views are breathtaking. Description of the landmarks is very good.",
          "Great to see the city lights at nighttime",
          "One of the many attractions in Brisbane. A must do for sure. Normally you get a good deal on groupon.",
          "Always a pretty view with a heavy price tag",
          "Price worth it. Can view brisbane cbd.",
          "I had friends visiting from Thailand and this is one of the places where I took them. We had fun and definitely a good experience for them.",
          "A little expensive for a local to ride the wheel with guests every time. If they reduced the price I would take visitors up there more often! It\u2019s generally really empty so I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t make it more popular!",
          "Goes for a decent time and you certainly get to see a lot of Brisbane from it. Favourite time is night time when city and Southbank are lit up. Beautiful too see both during the day and at night. Carriages are clean, safe and have air con with no jolting or lurches and very easy to get on and off for children and the elderly .",
          "Well worth the trip to do the wheel",
          "Great view on a hot 36 C day",
          "A good way to see the sights from ahigh.",
          "The wheel of Brisbane was not disappointing but I would not pay to go on it again. Advertised as being able to see all of Brisbane, once you are at the top the view barely goes past the local district of South Bank. The cabins are air \u2026",
          "Speechless. Let the pictures speak for them sleeves. There is 5 spins in total. The first spin can be quite daunting. But a great experience",
          "Great value , great view , great staff",
          "Prices absolutely ridiculous for what it is. $70 for a family to go on a Ferris Wheel is pretty disgusting. Groupon regularly have coupons but even then it's not cheap.",
          "Nice views but would b nicer if it went longer for the price u have to pay.",
          "Its expensive then they sting you after you get off with the photo book. You think its free and they charge you 35 bucks. Was a let down and should be included in the price.",
          "Not happy about that a health care card is not considered a concession card so had to pay full fair. Other than that it was great to be on it, many photos taken",
          "Good but not gr8.. u may skip it... london eye even d singapore wheel is far far better than this",
          "Good view over Bisbane",
          "Pretty to look at, tickets are overpriced and not worth it for what they pay for though",

          "Good viewing of the city area.",

          "Best vantage Point in Brisbane to see Riverfire every year.",
          "Well trained staff polite and professional",
          "Okay tourist activity. Couldn't really see the things highlighted on the map.",
          "It's cool but a little pricey. It's pretty big, but has nothing on the London eye.",
          "Pleasant, fully enclosed and air-conditioned cars with commentary. Brilliant views of the city. Very enjoyable ride, nice and gentle. You get your photo taken before you go on and it's ready to view when you get off, no obligation to purchase.",
          "Great experience. Can get the 360 degree view of the Brisbane city.  The gondolas are sequre and we get the feeling of utmost safety.  A must do activity in Brisbane.  Just 3 minutes walk from South Brisbane Station. \nStudents keep your ID cards with you, You get a concession!!!",
          "Spectacular views. Very smooth ride with very little noise or swinging movement - 5 rotations in all over about 10 minutes. Unfortunately not very friendly welcome and did feel like we were being herded like cattle. Very little \u2026",
          "Had a gondola all to my self. Very clear day. Loved it.",
          "Nice place to hang out.",
          "Haha great ride",
          "Nice views over the city",
          "A terrific way to see Brisbane South Bank and surrounding area. I went on a hot day and was glad to discover the cabs were air conditioned. I would like to go in the evening and see the city lights but I thought it was a little expensive especially if you are taking the whole family.",
          "What a fantastic place to go, the staff are very friendly and helpful and happy the ride is just fantastic, great views of all of Brisbane, get on the city cat that takes you over to south bank witch is a great place to go and get on the wheel",

          "A nice detail along the river!",
          "While walking around Southbank on a Tuesday night, the Wheel of Brisbane was nice addition to a first date. It gave a different view of parts of Brisbane you don\u2019t get to see from the ground. It's just fun and fabulous view of Brissy city \u2026",
          "Right on the Southbank edge of the river. Great view over the city. I can imagine it would be fantastic view at the top",
          "An interesting place to visit if you find yourself in Brisbane",
          "A little expensive. Better to see brisbane from a rooftop somewhere.",
          "Said ride went for 10-15 mins. Our ride lasted 5 mins. Huge waste of money for 5 mins. At least all the staff were very kind, friendly and super happy to help and interact with the customers. Just wish it went for the time that was advertised in the booklet.",
          "Stunning view over Brisbane, cabins air conditioned, 4 rounds $21/adult ticket. Beautiful South Bank Parkland with green area, street pools and lots of restaurants around. Must see location.",
          "Loved this so much.",
          "Good to go on with my daughter! Not that exciting for adults. But it is what it is. Glad we didn't pay full price though... Look for vouchers!",
          "Good city view must visit in evening",
          "Good way to capture the Brisbane city in a snapshot.  We had an hour to fill.",
          "Iconic place in the heart of Brisbane city. Don't forget to get a photo in their photo booth as a memory.",
          "Great attraction! Beautiful view. A little expensive though.",

          "Great family outing!",
          "Fantastic view. Make sure you get discounted tickets online.",

          "Every Christmas Eve, I take my wife on the wheel!! \n\nI pop the question on the wheel a few years and found out the sex of our future child. To say the least this place holds a special place in our heart!! \n\nBeautiful Views Brisbane City and \u2026",
          "Managed to get discounted tickets and it made it worth it! Great views, we went as the sun set and then got to see Brisbane light up. Didn't buy the pics, I've heard they are expensive.  Enjoyed it. Would go again and take the family",
          "The wheel of Brisbane was OK.  The park around it was woderful",

          "If you can get on here for a good price it might be worth it to do once. But I wouldn't be rushing out to go on the wheel. \n\nMight be good to take some visiting friends to.",

          "A ticket on the wheel gets you about 12 minutes on it. Each capsule is large enough for 4 people, has a help button, air conditioning and lighting. There is a sound track which describes various points of interest and historically \u2026",
          "I was really disappointed. The operator said I\u2019d get a stop at or near the top. Apparently he meant when they were loading the other cars, because that was the only time it so much as paused. The whole thing creaked and squeaked\u2014 to an \u2026",

          "Great view of Brisbane. I was happily surprised that it circled 4times before letting us off. That allowed me to get all the pictures I wanted.",
          "It\u2019s a huge and high ferris wheel.",
          "Didn't go on this but it looks nice at night time",
          "Because it's very fun and very awesome view from the top of the ferris wheel",
          "I love that it's a little bit rickity. South bank is so easy to be invisible and free",
          "It isn't very interesting during the day but is great when the person you ride with is afraid of heights... slightly. Not too much.",
          "Kids really enjoyed it and so did I",
          "Pretty touristy but nice views",
          "Fantastic views at night \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Beautiful! Must ride it. Got beautiful screen of Brisbane CBD.",
          "I didn't actually ride it, but all Ferris Wheel's are pretty much the same.  It's near the river and across from the CBD area so I guess you could get some nice views of buildings, if that's your thing. Also pricey, as most touristy things like this are.",
          "Nice place, good staff, well run great views, but at $25:00 for your picture, a bit steep.",
          "I would definitely recommend going and trying it out... It was worth it, the view was excellent and my little crew loved it...",
          "Spur of the moment activity. $21 bucks equates to 5 spins in the wheel  so for me not great value for money as it goes by so quickly. Cars have excellent air con  and the views are great.",
          "Great view but outrageous price!!!",
          "Loved the atmosphere and the breeze around the place. \nBest time evening.",
          "Would have been a great experience that was spoilt by staff Ricky. We've been on the wheel a few times but specially arranged to come with another family for the kids to enjoy the experience together. I understand we can't be in the same \u2026",
          "Love this area, have never actually been on the wheel however it makes for a great photo while lit up at night.",
          "Fantastic views of Brisbane city.",
          "Must do for every Brisbanian. Fun ride and experience.",
          "Shirt but fun ride in air conditioned comfort - note you can usually get the tickets online through Groupon cheaper ($13 instead of $22)",
          "Spacious family friendly many activities.",
          "Love it.. enough time to view the whole city...",
          "Lovely young lady in the ticket office. Great ride with magnificent views and informative commentary. Highly recommend.",

          "Great holiday fun and the view is a must! Any visitor to Brisbane will love Southbank too!",
          "Excellent. Good priced tickets if U book thru it accommodation. Top views, nice photos at night",
          "Enjoyed our ride on the big wheel and a lovely stroll around the  parkland and through the markets. Highly recommend  Southbank.",
          "Great view of the city lights",
          "Was told to ride my BICYCLE away from the wheel in case it blew up! (The bicycle, not the wheel). Security here is so over-handed it's not funny.",
          "Nice experience .if you come to brisbane you should go.can see arround the city & so far.beautiful view.",
          "Nice  for look out with Family",
          "It's a tad boring after a short while. The commentry is good. Went on at night. It's romantic but don't think we got to see a whole heap apart from city lights and the river. I think it's one of those attractions where you would try once and that's it.",
          "It's a nice, fun experience, but not quite worth the price charged.",
          "great fun for my kid. i took him 2 times on the occasion of his birthday outing. tickets bit expensive but better if you keep an eye online.",
          "What a great way to get an awesome view of Brizzie...",
          "Great tourist destination of even great fun for family to enjoy the sights of Brisbane.",
          "It's beautiful at night, but you can see more places during the day.",
          "It was fun, really good view of Brisbane City.",
          "Not much to see too be honest - poor value for money. They should probably include some snacks and increase time for the same money to make it worth.",
          "Indeed a nice view.  I liked the explanations. However, I didn't like the upselling attempt taking overpriced pictures which where not even very good. But well known strategy.",
          "Not bad value $22 per adult and decent views and commentary",
          "Well worth the money, although if ticket bought from information centre its cheaper.",
          "Great experience, have to do it at least once if visiting Brisbane.",
          "Loved the whole idea. However we were given a paper and didnt know it had pin points of what we were being told about till the very last sec. Would have been better if we were told that there was a map on the paper and pin pointed parts \u2026",
          "Very nice and outrageously fantastic. Its one of a kind engineering marvel to ride those things. The next time i will go there is to make propose ring with my gf., #@$depression decrease at .12% accumulation",

          "Great views of the  city  we did 7 rotations 4 that stopped  to view all over",
          "I came here with my partner and we both really enjoyed the views of Brisbane and the experience of the Wheel of Brisbane. We went while the sun was setting so it was a beautiful sight. My only down side of the experience was the commentary \u2026",
          "It's a good looking place, you can admire a cute sunset and a great view of the city.",

          "Little bit of fun quite pricey not as big as other city's wheels",
          "Went at night $21.00 aus pp we got about 7 round turns great nite views.  The glare is the reflection from white steel frame and windows bit grubby too. Make sure u have good camera.",

          "Fun place to visit and not too high to be scary! I don't like heights but managed this attraction fine.",
          "The ride is totally overpriced and makes you expect more than what you get.\n\nAdd to that there is no easy parking around and that you can get better views elsewhere for free\n\nAlso of note, the voice over explanations were too low, so barely audible.\n\nAs a once in a lifetime thing, sure, why not.",
          "Little expensive but a very good place to get a 360 degree view of the beautiful Brisbane city",
          "You will see it similar to London Eye and Singapore Flyer. Experience your visit of Brisbane with having a look to city of Brisbane and surrounding suburbs from the height. Located in the South Bank just by the river. Complete your \u2026",
          "Not a bad view, windows were dirty so hard to get a good picture",
          "Really cool, great picture opportunity of the Brisbane sign and sky line",
          "Nice, South Bank spot is really nice",
          "Fantastic! goes a bit faster than the London Eye. But you go round 4 or 5 times and it stops at the top on the last turn.",
          "A beautiful way to spend new years Eve with my son's. It was great experience.",
          "The wheel is not big enough to have a good view of Brisbane.",
          "Very nice very informative and a wonderful view",
          "We all had a great day at the Wheel.  Ten of us were given antipasto and a choice of drink (both alcoholic and non alcoholic ) while we took our ride. Afterwards a group photo was taken. Once paid for they gave us a booklet with 3 photos \u2026",

          "5 circulations in total with a great view. Limited view during night and rains.",

          "Great view of the river city",
          "A good little novelty activity for tourists and kids both during the day and at night. Not so much \"thrilling\" as it is just a nice way to catch a glimpse of the city from the perspective of a 60-meter tall person. The gondolas are air \u2026",
          "A good place to take visitors in brisbane",
          "Rode this when my family came to visit. It was a bit expensive but totally worth it as we had the whole cab to ourselves. The cabs were air-conditioned which is a welcome respite after walking about the Parklands. They also take pictures for souvenir which you can buy as an option.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Mount Coot-tha is a mountain and a suburb of the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the 2016 census, there were no residents in the suburb.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe mountain is 287 metres above sea level, has the highest peak within the urban footprint of Brisbane. It forms the eastern extent of the Taylor Range and is a prominent landmark approximately six kilometres (3.7 mi) to the west of the Brisbane central business district.  Visible from much of the city, Mount Coot-tha is a popular bushland tourist destination including the Brisbane Botanic Gardens and Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium, as well as a mountain drive, bike trails, parks including a waterfall, and television and radio towers. Mount Coot-tha is the source of Ithaca Creek.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the Moreton Bay penal settlement, Mount Coot-tha was the home of the Yugara Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal people came to the area to collect 'ku-ta' (honey) that was produced by the native stingless bee.\nIn 1839, surveyor James Warner and his team cleared the top of the mountain of all trees except one large eucalypt tree. Because this tree could be seen from many other locations, they used as a trigonometric station to take surveying measurements. This led to the mountain's former name One Tree Hill.Coot-tha meaning Honey Mountain is a derivative of the indigenous term which replaced the name One Tree Hill when the area was declared a park in August 1883. It was suggested by Henry Wyatt Radford, the Clerk of the Queensland Legislative Council.During World War II, the mountain was used as a military base by the RAAF and the US Navy. It was converted to a vast explosives depot and at one stage held more than 120,000 tonnes of explosive weapons. When darkness fell the lookout bristled with search lights in an amazing display as soldiers kept an eye out for enemy planes.anti-aircraft guns and searchlights were located on the lookout. Mount Coot-tha was also the site of US Naval Ammunition Depot (Navy 134) supplying submarines at the Capricorn Wharf at New Farm (Teneriffe) in Brisbane.In 1970 the Brisbane City Council established new botanic gardens at the base of the mountain with the intention of replacing the then Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Gardens Point in the Brisbane CBD (now known as the City Botanic Gardens) which was prone to flooding and lacked space for expansion. The new gardens were originally called the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens and were officially opened in 1976, becoming the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. The new gardens cover 52 hectares (130 acres).On 24 May 1978 Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium officially opened in the grounds of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens.The Mount Coot-tha Library opened in 1975 at the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Unlike most branches of the Brisbane City Libraries, this library specialises in botany, horticulture, gardening and landscape design.Brisbane community television channel 31 Digital broadcast from the mountain from 1994 to 2017, after which it shifted to internet streaming under the new name of Hitchhike TV.On 20 November 2005, one of the Mount Coot-tha trails, the Currawong trail, was renamed the Kokoda trail in honour of the Australian soldiers who marched the Kokoda Track during World War II. \nIn 2017 It was proposed to build Australia's longest zip-line from the summit of Mount Coot-tha down to the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Despite initially being approved by the Brisbane City Council, in April 2019 the new Mayor of Brisbane Adrian Schrinner decided to cancel the project due to the public protests.\n\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nMount Coot-tha has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nSir Samuel Griffith Drive: Mount Coot-tha Forest\nSir Samuel Griffith Drive: Mount Coot-tha Lookout\n\n\n== The Lookout ==\n\nMount Coot-tha is one of Brisbane's most popular tourist destinations and is a popular stop with bus tours. Of particular note is the Lookout, which includes the Kuta Cafe, Summit Restaurant, and Gift Shop.\n\nThe lookout, restaurant and cafe allow for panoramic views of the City. A function centre adjoins the restaurant. Well-known British astronomer Sir Patrick Moore gave a night-time public lecture about the stars of the southern hemisphere at the lookout in 1988, in conjunction with Patrick Moore being a guest speaker at a dinner of the Southern Astronomical Society at Toowong in Queensland.\n\n\n== Sir Samuel Griffith Drive ==\nSir Samuel Griffith Drive is a tourist drive circling the peak, providing access to the lookout, cafe, gift shop and restaurant.  The scenic drive, from the base of Mount Coot-tha to the lookout, is a winding, climbing journey that has views of the greater Brisbane area and of the mountains and coastline that disappear into the horizon.\n\n\n== The Mount Coot-tha Reserve ==\n\nThe Mount Coot-tha Reserve contains more than 1,500 hectares of natural bushland, including J C Slaughter Falls along Ithaca Creek, as well as native wildlife. Mount Coot-tha Reserve also shares a border with Brisbane Forest Park, which adds a further 25,000 hectares.\n\n\n== Television and radio towers ==\nOn a ridge near the summit on the other side of Mount Coot-tha, are the television transmission towers for the Brisbane television stations and their respective studios; Ten (TVQ-10), Nine (QTQ-9), Seven (BTQ-7). The transmission tower for (ABC Brisbane) is located on the mountain, which also broadcasts television for multicultural station SBS. Most of the FM Brisbane radio stations also transmit from Mount Coot-tha.\nPart of the Brisbane suburb of The Gap is located on the foothills beneath the television towers.\n\n\n== Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens ==\n\nAt the base of Mount Coot-tha are the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, which has a tropical plants hothouse and also the Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium within its grounds.\n\n\n== Walking tracks ==\nThere are several popular walking tracks around Mount Coot-tha, one of which includes an art display comprising works produced by local Aboriginal artists. The tracks vary in difficulty, with most involving some uphill sections or steps. Tracks around Mount Coot-tha are often used by hikers training to walk the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea as the terrain and climate are considered similar. \n\n\n== Mountain bike trails ==\n\nThe Western side of Mount Coot-tha Forest or Gap Creek Reserve as it is known to the locals is a haven for Brisbane mountain bike riders.  The establishment of a world class mountain bike trail network by the Brisbane City Council has created a diverse range of recreational experiences for off-road cyclists.\nThe mountain bike trails at Mount Coot-tha have been assigned a grading under the International Mountain Bicycling Association, Trail Difficulty Rating System.  The multi-use trails in Mount Coot-tha provide the least degree of technical challenge to mountain bike riders, however many of them are steep and loose.  Riders are advised to pay special attention when riding over the erosion control banks (water bars) which have been the downfall of many a novice rider.  The trail ratings provide a guide to the relative difficulty of each trail.\nThe multi-use tracks are used by horses, pedestrians and mountain bikers.  Each year orienteering events are held in the area.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nMount Coot-tha can be reached by Brisbane Transport Bus 471 (Translink). Between 2014 and 2016 the Brisbane City Council ran a CitySights Bus that included Mount Coot-tha. A short taxi ride from Toowong is also possible as well as Uber and such. Parking is limited at the peak.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nMount Coot-tha has a public library on Mt Coot-tha Road in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens operated by the Brisbane City Council. Unlike most public libraries in Brisbane which have general collections, this library holds a specialist collection about botany and astronomy and related topic reflecting its locations within the botanic garden and the Brisbane Planetarium also on the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFlora of Brisbane\nList of mountains in Australia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n* \"Mount Coot-Tha\".

          "We love taking our visiting family and friends here. The view over the city is gorgeous. Why not pack a picnic and settle in as the sun disappears and the city lights come to life.",
          "Because the city is so close the views are amaizng. Nice little cage for simple meal. No cost for entry. Quite busy but plenty of room.",
          "very clear views and coffee shop/restaurant also on site with a small shop. Car park for parking & close to botanic gardens to go to on same day.",
          "One of the best ways to see full view of the City of Brisbane is to go up to Mount Coot-tha Summit Lookout. Driving from the city to the summit may not take more than twenty minutes. It is certainly worth the effort. On a clear day, the view of the city from the summit is just",
          "Great vantage point to watch Riverfire celebrations if you can find a spot. Nice view over Brisbane.",
          "Awesome view and a free bus there from our hostel made this a fantastic morning visit. Would be even better for sunset but you need a car to get there. Nice cafe at the top too.",
          "Love driving up to Mt Cootha Lookout. The views are spectacular on a clear day plus you can grab a really great meal or snack up there. Parking can sometimes be an issue and there is a wait also for cafe food on busy days. There is a piano up there that you can play plus grass",
          "Fantastic views and cafe's on the top of the mountain, where you are really hard pushed not to be there on a day where you get a fantastic view. There are many walking trails to use or you can just sit at one of the cafe's and admire the city from afar.",
          "Love this place. We often come for a drive up to Mt Cootha enjoy a meal or a simple ice cream or even a nice cup of coffee. It is a very nice way to relax on either a Saturday or Sunday night or even by day.",
          "Only 20 minutes away from south bank. There is a cafe and resultant and shops at the summit. Spent 30 minutes here suffice if you not stopping for food.",
          "Really enjoyed the drive up to this lookout. The man in the souvenir shop was very friendly too . It\u2019s very close to the city and although we didn\u2019t eat there, it looked like a quite popular little cafe.",
          "We enjoyed a lovely family day out here. The walks and parks are very good with lots of water along the way. The day was topped off with a lovely ice cream while enjoying the views.",
          "Firstly we sat outside to an amazing view of Brisbane. As night closed in, the City looked fantastic. Along with the really good service and fabulous food it was a great night.",
          "Go here for great views over Brisbane, and also a pleasant walk in the forest. It does get busy and crowded in weekends and with visitors, but worth the effort, as not too far from centarl city .",
          "Made a quick stop here and saw some great views of the greater Brisbane area. It was pretty, but also basically a tourist trap where souvenirs were sold, etc. Don\u2019t expect a quiet \u201cnational park\u201d kind of setting- but worth a visit.",
          "Complete different view showing Brisbane and surrounding area. One of those things to do once. Been to Brisbane many times but missed this as some thing to visit. Cafe and souvenir shop.",
          "Well worth the drive! Great view and quite beautiful. Outside of the school holidays there weren't too many people, mainly other tourists.",
          "Great place to take in a panoramic view of Brisbane city by day or by night. With views extending to Moreton Bay, it's great for camera buffs. Chill out at the Kuta Cafe or have a decent meal at the Summit restaurant. In the daytime, remember to drop by the Botanical Garden and",
          "A little bit of tranquility in the every day hustle and bustle of the rat race. Here you can look down on what you belong to and for however long you want to stay there have peace and enjoy that for that time you are not part it. Great views, stretching from the north to the",
          "went to look at the view. Stayed for an early morning cuppa and scones. Amazing food, great service and a wonderful view. A spot with the lot!",
          "The best way to see the Mount Coot-tha Lookout and avoid the anti-climax of a great city view framed by tacky souvenir shops and tourists taking selfies followed by jumping back in the car is as follows: park your car at the eastern base of Mt. Cootha at the Reservoir Trail",
          "We had lunch up here and it was wonderful - great food, reasonably priced and a great view - well worth the trip up.",
          "We recently took overseas relatives to Mt Coot-tha. It was a wonderful clear day with clear views of Brisbane City CBD. We had lunch at the restaurant where we enjoyed an excellent meal while admiring the view.",
          "This is a very nice lookout of all of Brisbane. Parking is tough so plan for a wait for a space. Cars turn over quickly though.",
          "Was quite disappointmented in the view, wasn't anything like we were told it would be. Certainly not impressed",
          "Great city and Mountain views. Bring you picnic blanket if you want to lay down on the grass and enjoy the sunset views. If you are lucky some astronomer will have their telescopes out and you can stargaze. Best views during the winter thanks to clear air.",
          "Took my visitor to the lookout on a Monday. Perfect views of Brisbane and the surrounds (smoke from bushfires north of Brisbane rolled in later). Took a quick bushwalk along the Summit Track to JC Slaughter falls. Fairly easy, peaceful walk. Pleasant but would definitely",
          "We went to the lookout with our friend visiting from NZ. We had a lovely meal and a beautiful stroll around the lookout. An amazing view of Brisbane and surrounding areas.",
          "Nice view. We almost missed following our Google Maps directions. We didn't eat at the diner. Botanical Garden on the way there.",
          "Mount Cootha provides a wide variety of activities for the couple to undertake. The views are great up top and there is a very good cafe there. The walking tracks also provide wonderful exercise opportunities. Furthermore, the botanical gardens at its base are good for all ages",
          "We had a great time enjoying the view while having lunch at the restaurant there. It was most interesting as they were burning off and the skyline came in and out through the smoke",
          "Stunning views of Brisbane and great cafe to enjoy at the top. We used public transport. Only c20 mins from Adelaide Street. We spent about 1.5 hours. Great to get a full perspective of the city",
          "Took 2 New Zealanders to look at Brisbane. They were very impressed with the views, also the large diorama of the city and surrounds was a great help. Cafe (coffee) was very pleasant. A good souvenir section, but highly priced. The parking was not so good unless you get there",
          "View is absolutely beautiful, unfortunately that's all I liked about it. Parking is few and far between unless you get there at the crack of dawn. May as well take a picnic as queues are too long. Best bet would be to go weekdays to avoid the circus on the weekends.",
          "We had a drive out from the Gold Coast and we were not disappointed. The views are marvellous. the only thing I would say is to get there early, especially if you want to park close and even more if you want a seat at the caf\u00e9! Recommended!",
          "Just breathtaking Views forever on a good day. AVOID the Summit restaurant, exceptionally POOR service, unhappy, slack staff and mediocre food... Over priced for what you get. Cafe however has great views, reasonable food and nice staff",
          "It's best if you have a car to get here but it's worth doing and try and do it at twilight as the sun goes down! It's quite busy but there's a cafe and drinks vans up there! and you get a pretty good view of the city if the weather is good!",
          "Called here whilst visiting Brisbane & came for a panoramic view across the city & surrounding areas - stunning views - despite being slightly overcast we could still see for many miles - not too busy & ample parking - certainly for this time of year - one could imagine it gets",
          "Well then lookout is just another place in Brisbane where you can get views from high heights pointing South.. East and West all the local tv stations transmitters are located on the mountain and the 40koh speed limit means walking down bv the roads are safe. The lookout has the",
          "I went there during the winter. It's cool, shiny and windy. During the weekdays, the crowd is not that bad.",
          "If you are up here early enough you would be able to catch a good sunrise the tracks are good if your up for the walk expect a lot of hills and steep walking both ways, the falls would be great to see if has been raining within the last few days, unfortunately I did not look",
          "Brisbane is blessed with a fantastic lookout just minutes\u2019 drive from the CBD. Mt Coot-ha also houses the botanic gardens and planetarium. Good for family/weekend outings.",
          "Love it up here on a clear day, not the best of views with low lying fog, smoke or in bad weather but it\u2019s free and easy to access and a must do in Brisbane, just try to get a clear day to,get the most out of it.",
          "A must visit when in Brisbane to see the landscape views. Easy drive to the Mt and cafe plus souvenir shop are at the top also, tempting you to stay a little bit longer and enjoy this wonderful place. Only a short drive from downtown Brisbane",
          "Have been to Mt Cootha many times and never fails to disappoint. A must do if you ever visit Brisbane. There's a nice cafe beside the lookout which serves great coffee and food. Can get very busy during school holidays and weekends. Views are amazing regardless!",
          "Great for visitors and residents. See the spread of Brisbane, great photo opportunity. Cafe food was surprisingly good, there is a restaurant too.",
          "I love this place. Bring a picnic or meat for the bbq. Take your rubbish with you. Follow the tracks for a nature walk.",
          "The Mt Coot-tha Lookout is a wonderful thing to see when visiting Brisbane. It only takes about half an hour to get there from the CBD and is very easy to catch public transport. The only problem for us is that the public transport is few and far between from the lookout so we",
          "Skyline of brissy cn be seen n shot bfully Drive to n fro is very scenic Coffee is strictly ok here.. Cooler than brissy so dress accordingly",
          "Have been here before but had forgotten how lovely the views are. SO worth a visit - and the many picnic areas and walking trails in the park. The cafe is a tad expensive, but I guess you\u2019re paying for that outlook!",
          "The drive to Mt Cootha Lookout is steep and narrow but well worth the effort. We had a high tea with scones, jam and cream and I enjoyed the atmosphere. Looking over Brisbane and surrounds you can see the transformation which has occurred since the Commonwealth Games in 1988.",
          "Very nice walk up if you that way inclined. The city and views to the good coast are amazing. Well worth a visit",
          "You can see lovely night view there , it\u2019s worth visiting:-) I\u2019m not sure about morning and daytime, but I\u2019ll definitely try !",
          "This lookout offers amazing views of Brisbane, and is well provided with interpretative boards and an orientation table. It might, however, be a victim of its own success, since even in low tourist season (ok, it was school holidays) it took some while to find a parking space,",
          "Nothing too special or extraordinary but worth a visit if in Brisbane for a while for nice views of Brisbane if on way to Lone pine koala sanctuary .lovely cafe with great views. People laze around gaze stars or chat over a coffee and saw a couple get married too .parking spots",
          "Nice cafe, restaurant & gift shop with best view of the city. Locals visit often and visitors must see!",
          "Cold crisp air hit chocolate and cake from the cafe. Plenty of seating to take in the view over Brisbane at sunset. A great way to enjoy majestic views of Brisbane by night.",
          "Quick drive up for fantastic city views. Lots of parking and easy access to see the city. Lovely well-stocked cafe is a great place to grab a snack before heading down. Walking tracks are wide and easy to navigate.",
          "A great place to take visitors to Brisbane. Great views and also a choice of cafe or restaurant. It is really a great vista!",
          "At the restuaraunt the service was professional and food was very good and well presented (High Tea). Parking a little difficult and be prepared to wait a little to get a spot when someone leaves. Car park adjacent is \"tight\".",
          "Great way to see the city and surroundings. Will be back this week with relatives from overseas. Great cafe and restaurant to enjoy a beverage.",
          "This is worthwhile looking down over the city. You can see for kilometres even in a rainy day. Maps there orientate you to the surrounding areas.",
          "Great views for free, plenty of parking, places to eat, as well as toilets and stuff, kids would love this place, and also opportunities to take lots of pictures with the skylines.",

          "What a great place to watch the sun come up over Brisbane. Only wished that the cafe was open for breakfast. Had to drive elsewhere for that. Parking was easy at sunrise but rather hellish at other times of the day. Definitely not enough disability parking spots.",
          "Thank you to the friend who brought us go to Mount Coottha Lookout. We enjoy the night view at here. A restaurant and souvenir shop is located here.",
          "Wife and I took the chance to review the area and test out her new Camera.Met a lovely couple from P.N.G. they were here for holidays good to be able to help them out.",
          "Definitely worth visiting, quite crowded, there is parking. On a sunny day, a great day to see panoramic view of Brisbane!",
          "I've visited during the day but this time at night. Never really too crowded nice little Cafe to grab an ice cream. Cute little gift shop as well. On your aay down the hill there's and observatory and garden.",
          "You get cool breeze from the surrounding areas while enjoying the spectacular view of Brisbane. We went there for sunset, it was so amazing. We had dinner at the restaurant after that. Food was decent but the view worth all.",
          "View was average and the cafe/souvenir shop were overated. Too many people and nothing much to see/buy.",
          "The views of Brisbane city is fabulous. There is a cafe at the look-out, with prices comparable to other cafes in the town.",
          "Another place to take some time out and relax with a good view. Have been here a couple of times and the best time is outside of the lunch hour as most people seem to turn up for something to eat at this time (wonder why lol). Food is ok, and as you would expect there is a",
          "The view as the sunsets over Brisbane is simply stunning. The crowds are nothing you would expect and there is a killer cafe at the top too. Only drawback is the lack of transport to and from the lookout. Bring your own car or be prepared to book a taxi.",

          "We went on a Sunday, and the lookout was very busy, the views were spectacular. Long queues and wait for coffee and food in the Caf\u00e9. We went by public transport, bus 471 from Adelaide Street in the city (Bus stop 41), it was very convenient, on time and cheap.",
          "This place is totally looked after the toilets are super clean the grounds are well kept .The views and photos are awesome from up there and I'm not 100% sure but think its the only look out over Brisbane. We went to the coffee caf\u00e9 place for lunch and ended up staying up there",
          "On a clear day the views over. Roseanne Cory and out to Moreton Bay are unreal. Well worth a visit on a clear day. Coffee and food available at the cafe at the lookout",
          "Gardens are well maintained, beautiful. Combine with planetarium and a full day is planned. Would rec.",
          "We caught the bus here from the centre of Brisbane and that in itself was a neat experience. The actual lookout is a must see if you are visiting Brisbane.",
          "Great place to go and take visitors from out of town. Grab an ice cream or coffee or have something in the restaurant. There is also heaps of hiking tracks for all levels of fitness. A must to see and do while in Brisbane",
          "Went to a function at the Mt cootha function room. Terrible parking but the views were spectacular. It was a Saturday and crowded but all to be expected. Can\u2019t fault the scenic vistas and special lookout platforms but the buildings are so outdated for their purpose. Was put",
          "We saw a spectacular sunset from the lookout. The vista is beautiful and there are also many walking paths in the area. The parking was easier than we thought. By all means, if you are in the area take in a sunset at the Lookout.",
          "What a beautiful place to start your adventure if you\u2019re new to Brisbane... or if you\u2019re a local - stunning views of your home before you enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner. Which by the way tastes wonderful",

          "A nice drive up to the top of Mount Coot-Tha with peak a boo views until you reach the top then a spectacular view lays out below you. We intended to walk the JC Saughter Falls Trail but unfortunately we found it closed due to restoration. Other trails are available and many",
          "Came to the lookout just as the sun was setting over Brisbane. The view across the city was brilliant and the sunset made it even better. Plenty of parking available. A perfect place to spend the evening as drinks and food are also available the caf\u00e9 nearby. Definitely recommend",

          "Lovely views from the top and a nice cafe with lovely cakes. It does take time for service over the weekend since it\u2019s extremely popular. A high tea option with and without a glass of bubbly is also there. The garlic bread is really nice.",
          "It is well worth the trip to see the views of Brisbane and its hinterland from Mount Coot-tha lookout. The drive up to the lookout itself is quite an experience but really the place is all about the views. You can see for miles, There is also a cafe selling coffee and some nice",

          "I took some friends for a coffee and photos. We found the view to be amazing. When we went to the cafeteria the disappointment was evident from the moment we stepped in. Bad food, dirty place and overpriced. Someone should open a proper and modern coffee place.",

          "We came here as part of a tour. It\u2019s not 5 stars because I think a trip to Brisbane would be fine without it, but I think that is probably a personal call. There are lots of unobtrusive signs giving you history of the city and lookout. So unobtrusive that you need to make an",

          "There is a restaurant and cafe, where you can enjoy this breathtaking view. They are, of course, a bit overpriced due to the location but it is definitely worth it for that view. The food was also really worth it. We were there on a rather cloudy day, but it didn\u00b4t really",
          "We visited Mount Coot-tha lookout during a recent trip to Brisbane and the view you get of Brisbane from the lookout is amazing on a clear day. The cafe up there is great for a coffee and a bit to eat and a fine day was had by us all.",
          "We did one of the nice long walks to get here.The reward of course is the view. A pleasant, sunny day is a pre-requisite. The night view is of course pretty awesome too. Not over impressed with the cafe there, however.",
          "An amazing view from the lookout which is very close to the city and provides a brilliant view of Brisbane and surrounding areas. Well worth the trip up to take in the sights. Can get busy on weekends and also lots of walking tracks around the area which are very popular.",

          "If you are only in Brisbane one night make sure you go to Mount Coot-tha!! The views are something else. There is a resturant at the top which has amazing food. We went there on a Tuesday night and was pretty quite but I'm sure you would need to book on the weekends. The food",
          "While the views are wonderful from this vantage point, the service is terrible in the caf\u00e9. Just to order a coffee the queue was out the door. While the staff were friendly they look rushed and stressed. Something needs to be changed here. After waiting in the queue for",
          "Mount Cootha Lookout provides a great panaramic view of the city of Brisbane. Whilst it is easily accessible by road, it is also a great halfway point for people who love to hike the Mount Coot-tha bushwalking trails. There is a great cafe/restaurant at the Lookout that provides",
          "Lovely view from the top. The city started to twinkle as the light faded and the view improved over the next half hour, a great time to be there. This means you need to have a car, as I don\u2019t think buses run that late. parking was a little difficult as there are not many spots",
          "This look out is a great vantage point from which to gain an appreciation of the \u2018snaking character\u2019 of the Brisbane River. There is a cafe for a cool drink or snack and a popular restaurant which provides fine dining coupled with great views. Car parking is minimal, however",
          "We had a couple of hours to kill so caught the local public transport up to the lookout from the city. I took about 30mins and cost $10.00 for the two of us (adults). Once at the top the views are stunning, you can see for miles. There are a number of walking trails, where if",

          "For a tremendous 360 view of Brisbane, I recommend driving up to the summit of Mount Coot-tha. The view is tremendous and you can see for miles. There is a cafe and restaurant there too which are reasonably prices for lunch or refreshments. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "The view here is absolutely stunning, plenty of cafes and restaurants and gifts shops for all tastes. But the the views are stunning and wonderful, well worth a visit if you are here in this part of Australia",
          "Amazing views of the city. About a 30-40 minute hike up from the Brisbane planetarium, which is a place I also highly recommend visiting. Theres also bus service to the summit if you prefer not to hike.",
          "This is the place my wife fell in love with Brisbane. We have celebrated mother's day at the restaurant and birthdays. We have enjoyed the degustation and were blown away with the service and the quality of the food. Our whole family has wonderful memories of these events and",
          "Great view of Brisbane. Lots of families and couples picnicking and watching the sun set Not a lot to do once you\u2019ve seen the sights unless you ate at the restaurant. Could have used more info that described what direction you\u2019re facing or what you\u2019re actually looking at.",
          "Took a bus up from Adelaide st, city centre Took about 25 mins, through a lovely area Beautiful views across Brisbane, worth the visit to see Nice cafe but lack of staff... hence huge queues Lovely walk through woods to the bottom if you wish, and get the bus return there",
          "Not spectacular but easy to get to do well worth the time. A beautiful look out spot. You would,t go often but glad we went.",
          "The cafe at the top was bustling but provides good service. The view is spectacular and I found the historical information on the signs fascinating",
          "Mount Cootha is worth a visit any time of day but especially at sunrise and sunset. There is a restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner",
          "This was the first place we visited after arrival in Brisbane. We got a bird's eye view of Brisbane city. Since the day was clear, we could see long distances and local friends helped us identify several landmarks of the city. It was a nice way to start seeing the city",
          "Spectacular panoramic views of the city and surrounding mountains. Easy to find and adequate parking available, the first car park can stall though while cars are trying to get out and come in at the same time. Great cafe to enjoy refreshments while taking in the views",
          "stoped by for lunch - no reservation and the staff easily accommodated. The views of Brisbane are impressive. We took a seat outside and ordered the French margarita and cider. Both were excellent (We re-ordered the cider). At lunchtime they have a special menu where you can",
          "The view over Brisbane from this lookout is very good no matter what the weather is. It gives a good orientation of Brisbane and it\u2019s location to everything. The Kuta Cafe is also located next door for a quick, drink, snack or ice cream.",
          "Having been on the Wheel of Brisbane, walked around Southbank and had a nice dinner I thought we would take a run up to the lookout having not been up there for many years. Although it was a Monday night there were quite a few diners and a number of motorcycles. The view was",
          "If you only have a short time in Brisbane then a quick visit to this spot is a must. The view includes one of Brisbane.",
          "Recommended to us on our recent weekend in Brisbane,so glad we made it there. Stunning views in a relaxed atmosphere. We had lunch at the cafe while looking over the city - lovely. Lots of walks available too. There was a restaurant there aswell, little pricey for a quick lunch",
          "As a summer thunderstorm hit just as we exited our vehicle, we sheltered inside the cafe with a coffee until after the rain had ceased. And after the rain, the view of the city and beyond was amazing.",
          "Sat at the cafe for two hours chatting and drinking beer with an old friend we hadn\u2019t seen for 15 years",
          "If you\u2019re wanting to see the stunning lights of the city at night, then you can\u2019t beat the views from the top of Mt Cootha. If it\u2019s a clear night, take the one you love, have a meal and snuggle up for a while with a glass of bubbles. You\u2019ll be on a winner.",
          "A quick and easy viewing area to see all around Bribane and as far as the gold coast, Ipswich and Cunningham's gap and towards the sunshine coast. There is a cafeteriaup there with great snacks and coffee.",
          "This is a pretty place to go to get great panoramic views of Brisbane. There is also a nice cafe to grab some coffee and something to eat, as well as a small gift shop with touristy items for reasonable prices. Go on a clear day to take full advantage of the beautiful views.",
          "We went here hoping to hike the Summit Trail but it was closed due to construction on the trail. We hiked the alternate route which was still good but not challenging at all. It is mainly in the shade and provides a gradual climb up the mountain. Unfortunately, as you hike the",
          "The view of Brisbane is great. We had lunch at the cafe which was not great but not terrible. Chicken burger and Schnitzel were both dry but tasty. Would love to go back and try the Restaurant.",
          "Lovely place, and easy to reach whether driving or by public transport. There are a few places to eat and/or drink, and a souvenir gift shop, but little in the way of shelter if either the sun is throwing its burning rays down or if the rain strikes (as it did when I visited)",
          "Well worth the drive from the city to Mount Cootha for the best views over Brisbane city and beyond. There is a very nice cafe at the top serving great coffee, snacks and meals. They did have gluten free options if you are gf. There are also toilets that were clean at the top.",
          "Lovely spot, beautiful view, panoramic views of Brisbane. Nice coffee, very busy. Parking hard o get close.",
          "It is our first time to Brisbane and some very new local friends took us up to Mt Coot-tha upon arriving. So worth the short drive. Perfect to see all of the city lights come on. Arrive in the early evening and see the lay of the land. Then grab and drink or even a snack and",
          "Mount coot-tha lookout is a must the photographic opportunity here both day and night Are unbelievable and a memory all travelers to the river city of Brisbane will cherish long After they have returned home so for those special pictures of Brisbane city\u2019s main city centre if",
          "Nothing really special except seeing the city and the river. Was raining when I was there so not much to see. Have to go by car, I don\u2019t know if public transpo will be convenient.",

          "It was a clear night with a breeze blowing so was rather chilly up there and for a Saturday night the lookout had plenty of people of all ages coming and going but the view over Brisbane was spectacular. One of the best lookouts I have ever seen. You have to be lucky to get a",
          "Amazing views from way up the top! Very scenic and spectacularly nice sights. Great for lunch or cool drink before heading back down",
          "We drove up to the lookout at mount cootha what a spectacular view although the weather was stormy so low cloud cover restricted some. Lunch at the cafe was delicious staff friendly.",
          "Been ages since I've been up to Mt Coot-tha Lookout and this time I wondered how many people know the amazing secret there. When you walk across the tiles hurrying to overlook the view of our city, so many people \"overlook\" what's cleverly under their feet. If you look down",
          "Restaurant and caf\u00e9 are overpriced and of poor value. Otherwise, the area itself offers plenty of parking, beautiful walking trails and a nice atmosphere. Due to the overpricing I would say take your own picnic even if you like. However, if you don't mind touristy prices and low",
          "Nice spot to see the city and area from the distance. Usually quite crowded. It's worth visiting if you are in Brisbane.",
          "On our way back from the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, our tour driver stopped at the Mount Coot-tha Lookout. It was a night panoramic view of the city of Brisbane. We worth 15 - 30 minutes we spent here.",
          "Great views over looking Brisbane City and surrounding areas. Great views off the River and out to the coast. Nice cafe with great selection of food and drinks on the menu. The look out has plenty of informative information pointing out the islands, mountains and flora and forna",

          "A must-visit place, even if you only spend an hour here. The views of the city are fantastic. It was very busy and parking could be a challenge at busy times. There is a cafe and a gift shop.",
          "I used to Jog up here from St Lucia area every weekend. But whenever there are visits, I would bring them up here either day or night to admire the amazing view of Beautiful Brisbane city.",
          "Fantastic view. Lots of vantage points with a good road to the top with very accessible view points. Icecreams and sorbets from the cafe were delicious.",
          "We just went for the view. No food, etc. The view was great. Parking might be a challenge on a weekend afternoon.",
          "Try to spend at least an hour here. Its a pleasant place to be. We were given too short a time to be here. Do carry a wide angle lense to go with yoyr camera and yes, binocs too. The place offers a commanding view of Brisbane city! There is a nice cafe up there at the top and",
          "Fantastic viewing area of Brisbane. Nice little tearoom. Plenty parking. A must if visiting Brisbane",
          "Mount Coot-tha lookout is a must do in Brisbane along with Lone pine Koala Sanctuary and the city cat ferry. The best time to go is week days and at sunset. There should not be too many people and you can enjoy the amazing golden hours for nice pictures. Once the sun is down,",
          "Special views of Brisbane morning, noon and night. Take your binoculars and your cameras...thank me later \ud83d\ude01. Only down side is the crazy high prices in the cafe....I expect MUCH better food for these prices. Maybe take your own picnic and enjoy it at the beautiful Botanical",
          "I love Mt Coot-tha... for as long as I remember it has my \u201cspot to think\u201d. The views of the city are delightful both by day and by night. It\u2019s a lovely place to have a coffee and a chat. Or a dinner by night. Really well worth a visit while you\u2019re visiting Brisbane, and",
          "It\u2019s a wonderful place to start with. Went there during sunrise. The weather was cold and the sunrise from the top view was beautiful. Strongly recommend you guys to bring along your jacket, a cup of hot tea and snacks as shop were all closed. Obviously it was early in the",
          "A great place to go to get wonderful views over Brisbane. You can come up for something to eat and drink and stay until the sun goes down and see both types of view over the city",
          "Mount coo-tha look out is an amazing place to visit with family and friends with a beautiful view during a clear day or night. A cafe and restaurant to get something to eat although they're pricey.",
          "Drove up for dinner at the cafe and was impressed with the view of the city at night , food was good and there is a restaurant for a more formal evenings also , it's great as they cater for all budgets , will definitely go back sometime .",
          "there is a resturant and coffee shopat the lookout where you get a panoramic view of the city and suburbs all the way out to moreton island on a good day Well worth a visit even at night",
          "Went with friends from interstate and the views were amazing. We had a cuppa and something to eat. I was surprised how many people came and went but how it never felt crowded.",
          "Nice drive around the top capped off with a great view from the lookout. Plenty of walks and rides and picnic areas. Even on a bit of a rainy day it is pretty.",
          "Great place to sit and emjoy the views across Brisbane city and beyond. There is also a restaurant for tbose wanting a bit more than a quick bite.",
          "Mount Coot-tha has one of the best views in Brisbane and some good food options but finding a carpark is like finding a needle in a haystack.",
          "If you are looking for a great vista of Brisbane, then head to Mt Coot-tha Lookout, but make sure you pick either a clear day or a low cloud day, which is equally spectacular, with the high-rise buildings appearing above the clouds, Be prepared to spend some time up here, as",
          "If nothing else it's due in Brisbane this is a must you can see all the way over to Ipswich from up here or so over to Moreton Island it's a great view of Brisbane and well worth the trip you will not be disappointed you can also grab a coffee and a sandwich while you're up",
          "went for sunrise but it was cloudy. there are nice hiking trails but the trailheads are not well marked. I would only recommend going at sunrise or sunset",
          "I traveled here with friends to catch a glimpse of the city from further away. The Brisbane skyline is stunning from this spot. Great activity within a close travelling distance.",
          "Well worth the drive up if you have a car while visiting Brisbane, if not hop on the council bus from the city. Great views across Brisbane all the way over to Moreton Bay, lots of information about the area and a good cafe for a coffee/ lunch whatever! If you can snag a table",
          "Alas given it is a beautiful view for sunrise, I draw the line there, too many people get told it's great for sunset and that's simply not true. Best to visit kangaroo point cliffs for that.",
          "Amazing look out over the city. Can even see down to the Gold Coast. Would recommend and it was an overcast night so could imagine how great it would be during a clear night!",
          "It's worth spending there an hour or two just to savor the view and eat an ice-cream or a sandwich in a pleasant cafe! You could also buy some souvenirs for your friends and family. For those who do not like walking, there is a bus going from Botanic garden to Mount Coot-tha.",
          "I had brunch at the cafe with a friend and it was lovely. Service was great and the food was yum. It was a nice sunny warm day with spectacular views over Brisbane and greater area. It\u2019s well worth the visit!",
          "We go there for our family and friends from overseas. It\u2019s a beautiful lookout but it will only last a few minutes before you would want to leave unless you decide to have lunch or dinner at the restaurant. I assume the food is a bit pricey.",
          "Drove up after work done, just in time to catch sun set. From the look out you can see the city and it's surrounding area. Also there are some Cafe and Bar for you to enjoy the cool breeze with some drinks. Occasionally there will be some local flightless birds that just walks",
          "If you're looking for views of the whole city, this is a great spot. It's especially cool at dusk and after dark when the city lights come on.",
          "If you're a visitor to Brisbane and want to look out over the city, this is the place to go. You can see BNE, the port, CBD Mt Gravatt, the river and lots of other places. There is even a map to help you identify them. It is easy to get to on bus 471 from Adelaide Street stop.",
          "With Brisbane sprawling in amany directions, this place gives you a chance to see 360 degrees. The road is a little tricky to find, but there is parking up the top if you don\u2019t want to walk it. A cafe sells well-priced snacks, and there is a bar, if you\u2019re in need of",
          "We ften walk to the lookout from the bottom, starting at Slaughter Falls. It's a challenging walk if you haven't done it for a while but there are a few water stops so take a drink bottle to refill. The hard slog is rewarded with a spectacular view at the top and you can buy",
          "We arrived around noon to an amazing free view of Brisbane. Don't be disheartened if the first few car parks are full, there are more around the hill. However, that said, parking is at a premium, so be prepared. Plenty of people around, but that just means lots of people you",
          "Truly a wonderful view of Brisbane but come as the sun goes down and you are in for something magical. The lights come out and it seems like you are in the centre of a fairy tale. Nearly a 360 degree view of the lights of Brisbane slightly obscured by a few trees in places, but",
          "The whole city of Brisbane can be viewed from here Good calm place to spend The night lights of the city from the location looks Awesome",
          "This is THE location to go if you want to see Brisbane and get a sense of the dimensions of the city. You can see all the major landmarks when the weather is clear and the lookout is located in bushland so it gives foreign visitors the benefit of seeing a city in the bush. This",
          "This is a good view of Brisbane but it\u2019s hot and crowded and not that exciting and the cafe is very ordinary .Parking can also be difficult to find Both the service and food were disappointing Obviously not trying to impress the many tourists up there I wouldn\u2019t bother going",
          "Went by bus all the way which is a cheap way to see the city from above as well as the. Botanics which is the stop before. The bus goes from the city centre every hour. The panoramic views of the city make the trip worthwhile though it gets busy with tours. There is a cafe and",
          "Really good opportunity to be able to see all of Brisbane. Gives you a great perspective of the overall city and does not take far to get there if staying from the city.",

          "Beautiful view of 300 degrees Brisbabe from top of Mt Cootha mountain. Just 10 min from city.At night you see Brisbane by night lights and it's amazing with moon in the sky too. Lovely cafe there as well as a great formal restaurant called The summit. Summit serves great food.",
          "Great place to take visitors to our fair city. Best time to be up there is just before dusk as the city lights come on and the sun goes down. Take your camera. Restaurant and coffee shop as well as bathroom facilities. Great walking tracks. Car parking available. Bus drop off",
          "This is really a must to do if time permits, it gives you a birds eye view so to speak to see Brisbane's surrounds, on a clear day which in Brisbane is most days you can see the Brisbane Airport, and our beautiful Moreton Bay as well as our great CBD, there are fantastic hiking",
          "Stopped here on our way to the airport. Great views and a lovely breakfast. Worth a short stop to see the entire city. Probably beautiful at sunset as well!",
          "We took a city bus from our hotel in Brisbane to Mount Coot-tha. The cost is only $4.80 per person and the ride takes about a 1/2 hour. The overlook area is large and you can certainly get some good pictures of the city from the summit. There is a restaurant here, although we",
          "Part of our Brisbane Best day tour. Great view of this incredible city. Highly recommended for a visit.",
          "This is worth a visit but not easy to get to without a car. A nice restaurant at the top and plenty of walks nearby",
          "Nothing spectacular. Beautiful view of Brisabane . You may want to couple it up with a trek in the woods adjacent to the lookout or a lunch on the terrace at the cafe, Also keep your speed limit when going their, We encountered police doing radar on the way and down.",
          "Mt-cootha its a must when you are visiting Brisbane. If you like photography catch the sunrise from here its truly an experience! there is a coffee shop and a restaurant at the lookout where you can catch a coffee or a meal. If you can try to avoid Sundays specially around lunch",
          "Nice escape from the city for a business meeting catch up. Nice views & relaxed except for the tourists but they are welcome always. Cafe is a cafe & it\u2019s a good enough cafe. Staff were great. Coffee & food was fine. If you are going up there just for the cafe or restaurant then",

          "The view from the lookout is stunning. It reminded me of the line from White Heat, when James Cagney: \u201cLook at me, Ma! I'm at the top of the world!\u201d Brisbane looked like a mirage. We had an enjoyable light lunch at the cafe.",

          "A place to come for great views of the city of Brisbane - but it isn't very easy to get to. Once there, there is a cafe and restaurant - so you can spend a bit more time there.",
          "We love to go to Mt Cootha as there are plenty of walks, picnic areas and always a lot to see. The walking trails are well maintained and there are plenty of places to just sit and relax or for the kids to run and play. It can get very busy so best get there early. The cafe",
          "I cannot recommend watching the sunrise from the Mount coot-the lookout. Its stunning. The walks around the lookout are brilliant too and worth exploring once the sun has come up",
          "The Mt Kootha lookout is a lovely place,to see all of Brisbane from. With amenities, a cafe and a restaurant with a view, there is something for everyone. Surrounded by national park, there are great walking trails to suit all different ages. Lots of parking but sometimes that's",
          "The views over Brisbane give the city a different perspective. We went early evening to catch the light and day difference. Not disappointed at all. A huge viewing platform with tearoom and gift shop. We had taken our own food with us so just treated ourselves to the delicious",
          "It's very crowded with a poorly designed car park that keeps getting clogged by clueless drivers going the wrong way and waiting for a space. Not worth the hassle really as even on a clear day the view isn't that great in my opinion. Mount Coot-tha isn't that high and the city",
          "We went up there on a sultry overcast morning and the city was nearly invisible. The summit is topped by the inevitable caf\u00e9 and gift shop. The fun part was travelling to the summit by bus, which takes a tortuous route through Brisbane's inner NW suburbs.",

          "We only dropped in on the way home after a great picnic and walk at Simpson's Falls. WAY too many people there so we turned around and left. Too many people in close proximity to each other. Will go back again after the pandemic is over.",
          "The best palce to see the whole Brisbane is surely Mt Coot-tha Summit Lookout. The views are amazing. Brisbane city, it's suburbs, Near by islands (Moreton bay and North Stradbroke Island ), Nearby Mountains....Blue lit skies..... Wow... Lot of things. Its just awesome.",

          "This is my first time to this location and would certainly come back.\n\nMt Coot-tha Lookout has some amazing views over Brisbane. It is definitely worth coming to see it at night and watching the lights of the Brisbane skyline. I am sure it \u2026",
          "Amazing views of Brisbane city and surrounds and lots of wonderful walking tracks.",

          "Definitely recommend the place. Breathtaking views of Brisbane city and surrounding mountains. A couple of cafes and restaurants good for a drink or coffee facing the beautiful view. Botanical garden is on the way to the lookout too so you might consider stopping there too. Highly recommended!",
          "Nice place good coffee buy unfortunately the most unclean toilets you can find anywhere.",
          "Trails and good views of Brisbane is what you expected. Never failed you at all. But only thing that disappointed me is that telescopes are not working at all even if you followed that instructions. Wasted 2 dollars but... worth trying it out yourself. Maybe I\u2019m just a idiot.",
          "An amazing spot with a beautiful view over the city. You can hike or drive there and have a fun time with a nice lookout and grab a beer if you want to relax and unwind. One of the best spots in Brisbane to watch the sunrise or sunset!",
          "I had a great day. Went for a walk up to the top and had a coffee.",
          "Beautiful and fun place that makes you feel you are outside of the city while it will take you some minutes to get there. The restaurant at the top is open again, so you can have a bite and a drink. If you are a cyclist, it's a lot of fun to climb.",

          "Great spot. \n\nCoffee shops were under renovation and closed which I hope they finish with soon. Apart from that its a great spot to go while in Brisbane.",
          "As usual, a beautiful view. Only complaint is the amount of people even so late at night, but with such a fantastic view it's not surprising. Food is as usual a little on the pricey side, but it's tasty and convenient.",
          "Great view perfect for a Sunday afternoon... It was a great place on a clear afternoon the view of the city were incredibly awesome..",
          "Amazing view at this historical view point. One not to miss if your visiting Brisbane. You can see the whole city whilst enjoying a coffee. It's even more beautiful at night with the city lights.",

          "Spectacular, go there! Your loss if you miss it.",
          "The views of Brisbane and surrounding regions are spectacular. Great cafe for a tasty snack, an icecream and/or a coffee. The Summit Restaurant & Bar next to the cafe would provide an excellent spot for a picturesque evening meal with someone special.",
          "Beautiful place to grab a bite from the summit and to sit down and enjoy the view.. recommend: going at night and a ND filter for a professional camera and you're sure to get beautiful photos of the city at night. Highly recommend going to see it for yourself and grab a coffee and enjoy the view.",
          "Amazing place, just minutes from Brisbane CBD. We often come here on weekdays after work just to have a hot chocolate and enjoy the view of the city and stars. If you can wake up early enough, the sunrises are spectacular and you get unrestricted views of the city.",
          "Fantastic walk up to a great view",
          "Beautiful city views day or night. Restaurant and cafe available, place to lay picnic blanket. Can get very busy so expect to park and walk a few hundred metres. Pack a jacket as can get a little chilly there.",
          "This is one of the best place to have a majestic view of the Brisbane City. Its just 10 to 15 min drive from the city. You can either witness beautiful sunrise in the morning or beautifully shimmering city at night.",
          "Views are great. Accessible both on foot for the fit and by car for the rest of the family. Food and drink available but it would be better with more seating available to meet demand.",
          "I gave Mt Cootha lookout five stars for the view, but I went on New Year's day, when lots of others were there as well. Also, with that many people, the restaurant should be open for breakfast. I am sure a lot of people would enjoy breakfast overlooking the city and watching the sunrise on New Year's day",
          "Great views of the city and great spot to take visitors or the kids. Will be good once the renovation of the cafe is finished.",
          "Lovely place to chill and sight Brisbane City!",
          "Stunning sunsets, sweeping views of Brisbane.",
          "Great view. Cafe has lovely meals. Watch out for the swooping kookaburra that loves chips!",
          "Awesome mountain... Maybe only Mount Panorama... and Mt Everest beat this mountain. But because I only earn 25 dollars and hour and am oppressed I can't go to Panorama or Everest anytime soon. \n\nGreat views. Good vibes. Good atmosphere. \u2026",
          "Restaurants and cafe are permanently closed. There was a food truck but we did not go. We had lunch at Botanical Gardens down the road.",

          "This is great views of Brisbane and at night a great place to make out with your partner of choice. Use to come up at 17 just after I got my licence and pash my partner here. Always felt safe.",
          "What a lovely view of entire Brisbane from here. During the day undoubtedly it looks beautiful but during the night it's even better",
          "You have to be there before sunrise otherwise there\u2019s no pint going there.\nIt\u2019s a good cozy romantic date place though.",
          "Beautiful lookout to Brisbane and it's surrounding suburbs. Has a really nice cafe up top and some hiking trails around the scenic drive. Downsides are..the cafe is waaay overpriced so don't go hungry, the restaurant is mediocre at best and \u2026",
          "It is a small place on a hill top from where you can see skyline of the city ,a short halt for photo stop,,a few souvenir shops with a small restaurant",
          "Great lookout, can get pretty crowded, we come just for the climb",
          "Awesome spot to take in the Brisbane city skyline. A must visit for any tourist. The car park can get a a little busy on the weekends and public holidays. The cafe is decent but prices are reflective of it being located at a major tourist spot.  Apparently it's a great spot to watch the sunrise (but have not personally witnessed that).",
          "Terrific views of the Brisbane city and surrounding areas really spectacular at night. Little cafe to have a light meal, coffee or ice cream. New restaurant opening soon.",
          "The view was nice from the top, unfortunately it was foggy (or maybe smoke due to bushfire) so the view is barely visible. You can go to this place by using the free bus traversing the Botanical Garden-Lookout and vv. And there are restaurants here, so don't worry, you can fill your tummy for your next stop!",
          "Short drive away from the city, with a gorgeous view over and around the whole city. Can see all the way to Moreton Bay on a clear day. Must do when visiting Brisbane.",
          "The best view of the city. Night has the spectacular view. Best time to visit is just before the sunset.",
          "Food is over priced ($20 for a small piece of frozen fish and half a potato of chips)  for the quality will give it a miss next time",
          "I have visited this place a few times,  but the view is just spectacular! Not to mention the fresh air around the place. It's a place to visit just for relaxation.",
          "Lovely view but restaurant not open and weather terrible when we were there. Try again another day.",
          "Always love a beautiful view, especially in the evenings! Clean and tidy, carpark sometimes gets hectic",
          "Beautiful views of Brisbane from here. Cafe was very busy but nice if you want to catch the view at sunset",
          "The Mount Coot-tha lookout is a great place to visit and see the best view of Brisbane city and its surroundings. It\u2019s quite isolated though has ample facilities up there including somewhere to eat and rest. You can also check out the \u2026",
          "Amazing \ud83d\ude0d place, at any time",

          "We visited on a clear sunny day at about 3pm. Great activity if you have never been or looking for something to do, wonderful view of Brisbane. The take away shop serves great hot chips as a snack. The restaurant looks good, we might go back with family to get a meal and see the evening lights..",
          "Staff are friendly, helpful and full of information. There are many nice pieces of art work to look at, a gift shop and a coat and baggage check for free.",

          "Best place to view the city on a clear day",

          "Good parking also for large caravans. Nice view over Brisbane incl. some information panels.",
          "Great views of the city on a clear day. Can get packed at times being so touristy but an easy drive and worthwhile visit.",

          "Beautiful place, especially at night. Incredible restaurant. Reasonably priced. Great location!",
          "Great view. The cafe is very over priced so bring your own food and drink. The signage describing historical information is very old and weathered and difficult to read.",
          "Awsome space to look out. Parking was either difficult or a bit of a walk using the furtherist Carpark. Other wise, gas great views, caffe and lovely gardens.  Enjoyed it very much. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Nice views. Restaurant/ coffee shop. Fantastic way to see BRISBANE in panorama.",
          "it's popular place no need explain\nbut give you a tip\nvisi botanic garden 3hrs before sunset  and go lookout point\nhave a coffee you can see day and night vies together \ngood for 1time visit but i've been about 10times",

          "We turned up lunch time on the weekend and decided to have a meal there.  We did not have to wait long and we were a party of 4.   We had plenty of time to gaze at the fantastic views across Brisbane and took our time deciding from the \u2026",
          "Beautiful spot. Cafe pretty expensive. Good views over Brisbane. Brush turkeys at home scavanging from tables. Nice drive to get there",
          "This could be considered the heart of Brisbane. Always a great place, no matter what time of day or year.",
          "Great views and fast service for food and coffee despite being busy at the time I visited. Pretty cool. Pretty cool.",
          "Great view. Have lawn for pacnic, and enjoy the wind in the highest spot of Brisbane. Haven't been the Cafe there, but it smells good. Clean washroom with baby change room. There is a bushwalk path aroung the lookout as well. The weather \u2026",
          "Feels like too of the city!!! Stunning view especially in the night!!!",
          "Beautiful. The little cafe at the top is lovely too",
          "An Ok spot but nothing to really keep you here for more then 10 minutes unless you dine. Facilities are dated and maps are faded. Such a missed opportunity for greatness.",
          "Great view of Brisbane city. Not too crowded, good cafe",
          "Best lookout on Mt Coot-tha for sure, gives a great view of Brisbane, and whilst the new carpark looks nice, parking has decreased slightly. Still definitely worth a visit.",
          "It was said to Mount Coot-Tha in such a run down state. Beautiful as always but needs some attention.",
          "Good views, nice food",
          "It's actually really hard to take good pics of Brisbane. It's really far away and the city is not tall or big as it's rather spread out. Also, photos would be even harder as there's a lot of light pollution. Not from the city, but roads and \u2026",
          "Amazing place to feel the sunrise and sunset , if you are nature lover then it's a Best place to spend sometime here. The complete Brisbane cities and the river is looks like in canvas way.",
          "If you want a panoramic view of Brisbane city  and all the surrounding areas then this is the place to be. The only draw back is, it's quite a tourist attraction and expect large crowds and limited parking.",
          "It's a great way to see Brisbane & surroundings.  The best views are in Winter, when it's very clear!\nThis was taken a couple of weeks ago, but because of the Bushfires we are having, it looks like that now!",
          "Really nice lookout. Unfortunately Google Maps lead us to the very back end of the mountain so we went on a long hike to get to the where the actual lookout is. (25 mins) Good walking track, very uphill and quite hard but going down is the \u2026",
          "When visiting Brisbane we always go to  Mt Coo-tha for morning tea.    Beautiful views.",
          "It\u2019s a unique place to have a meal & the food is very nice.  The girl serving was very sweet but overall I got the feeling that they didn\u2019t feel they had to try too hard.  There was a problem on arrival as although we had booked & it wasn\u2019t \u2026",
          "The view is spectacular as always. The milkshake was milk with flavoured syrup and expensive. Food here is always expensive. Parking at time can be impossible to find and expect it to be hectic at the best of times and chaos if there is a tour bus. Worth the views though. Take a hat and water not much shade",
          "Good lookout. Can see Brisbane on a clear day. Car park gets extremely crowded on weekends.",
          "Slightly disappointed as we could not really see the sun set. It was in the other direction and blocked by tall trees. Perhaps sunrise would have been more beautiful.",
          "This lookout needs to come out alive. Shops, cafes and proper sheds for resting places should be available especially for the senior citizens as a good number of them regulates the place.",
          "Great view over Brisbane. I got a free shuttle bus up to here from the botanic gardens",
          "Nice view, not much else up there but if you've got some time to kill it's worth the trip.",
          "Excellent place to go to during evenings to beat the heat and soak in the great view. Cafe and restaurants complete the outing and makes it totally worthwhile.",

          "Great spot to have a brunch, lunch or afternoon tea & take in the views of the city of Brisbane. I ordered the most delicious Bruschetta accompanied with a glass of Chardonnay. Reasonably priced with a couple of vegan options. Top location. You'll definately want to linger longer.",
          "Great place to walk and exercise",
          "I went in the night and it was cool! Really nice to see practically the whole city at night! And it was cool too that night...",
          "Disappointing, tiny tiny coffee cups matched with big prices, Im guessing new owners chasing bigger margins",
          "Always fun to be a tourist in your own city. A Sunday drive to the summut is an excellent way to see how the city is changing. Stopped for a decadent iced chocolate a large and rich caramel slice.",
          "Does it ever get hazy from up here ?  I don\u2019t know.  But we were there on a clear day and the view was amazingly beautiful !!  \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f  You can see as far as your eyes could see.  There\u2019s also a really nice restaurant up there.",
          "Amazing place to hang out and relax",
          "Brisbane Lookout is a must-see for all visitors from Brisbane. It is the highest point in Brisbane with remarkable panoramic views of the city. There is also a restaurant to have lunch but be sure to bring enough money as it can get very pricey.",
          "Great spot! Nice drive too!",
          "Nice veiw over Brisbane. Can be crowded and full of parked tourists busses. Nice little Cafe and gift shop on the top. Nice roads and parking for all",
          "Touristy, nice view of city, expensive cafe. But still worth a trip up here for the views. Stay a while longer and walk through the forest. Lots of tracks for different capabilities and modes makes for a great active morning topped off with a coffee.",
          "Great walks ! Great View's of Brisbane! Nice coffee, cake, restaurant. Only downside was the little shop had no one to serve so you had to join the long queue in the restaurant !! Hence i returned goods to shop & left as queue was too long plus I'd already queued once for food.",
          "Very beautiful... it is as awesome during the day as it is at night.",
          "Great view! Good for a short stop off. Worth the time.",

          "An really nice view, including looking and spotting land mark buildings.\n\nI was totally surprised to get a park up the very top, next to the cafe. Sunday afternoons aren\u2019t easy at all to get a park!\n\nIt was a absolutely beautiful day too. Well worth the dive up, with out a doubt!",
          "Can't beet the view always a space to look out, parking is sometimes skares",

          "Really would have been a great view, except  it was really the wrong time to go too much smoke in the air from the Bush fires. Really would like to go back on a better day with my DSLR camera.",
          "Great place to visit, it was a shore excursion I picked when we visited Sydney while I was on cruise ship Celebrity solstice would do this shore excursion again recommended to other people.",
          "View is okay, very far away so everything is tiny but you can still get to see the landscape. Good luck finding any parking/getting stuck trying to back out of a full parking lot with 4 cars also behind you..",
          "Great way to see the City and surrounds,and our furry friends if you look close enough.",
          "Stunning view of Brisbane. And close to the city too. Well worth a visit",

          "The view as always us amazing to see.  You can clearly see the CBD, Moreton Bay, Up to the Sunshine Coast and Surfers Paradise.  In day light it is just as spectacular and breath taking.  Take your time walking around and bring a camera for \u2026",

          "Such a great view over Brisbane city from the top. Highly recommended. There is also a walking trail which you can talk through the bush which will lead you all the way to the top of the mountain where you can get a nice cool drink when you're finished the hike. Such a peaceful place. Great community up there always.",

        "wiki": "Brisbane ( (listen)) is the capital of and the most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of over 2.5 million, and the South East Queensland metropolitan region, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.6 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the historic European settlement and is situated inside a peninsula of the Brisbane River, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) from its mouth at Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges. It sprawls across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs)\u2014most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is \"Brisbanite\", whilst common nicknames include \"Brissy\", \"River City\" and \"Brisvegas\".One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the Aboriginal Turrbal and Jagera nations. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located\u2014which in turn takes its name from Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales at the time of the city's founding\u2014the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. The Moreton Bay penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 kilometres (17 mi) north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur.A diverse city with 32.2% of its metropolitan population being foreign born, Brisbane is classified as a global city, and ranks highly in ratings of liveable cities. Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city's built heritage. The city is noted for its cuisine brunches, outdoor dining, and rooftop bar scene. Brisbane was also the origin of the Anzac Day tradition through the works of Canon David John Garland. \nA transportation hub, Brisbane is served by a large suburban rail network, popular bus and ferry networks as well as Australia's third-busiest airport and seaport.\nBrisbane is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, which are home to numerous popular surf beaches, located immediately south and north of Brisbane respectively. Major landmarks and attractions include South Bank Parklands, the Queensland Cultural Centre (including the Queensland Museum, Queensland Art Gallery, Gallery of Modern Art, Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland), City Hall, the Story Bridge, the Howard Smith Wharves, ANZAC Square, St John's Cathedral, Fortitude Valley (including James Street and Chinatown), West End, the Teneriffe woolstores precinct, the Brisbane River and its Riverwalk network, the City Botanic Gardens, Roma Street Parkland, New Farm Park (including the Brisbane Powerhouse), the Kangaroo Point Cliffs and park, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the Mount Coot-tha Reserve (including Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens), the D'Aguilar Range and National Park, as well as Moreton Bay (including Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands, and coastal suburbs such as Shorncliffe, Wynnum and those on the Redcliffe Peninsula).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-19th century ===\nIndigenous Australians are believed to have lived in coastal South East Queensland for 22,000 years, with an estimated population between 6,000 and 10,000 individuals before white settlement. At this time, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Jagera people, including the Turrbal group, who knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning \"place shaped as a spike\". Archaeological evidence suggests frequent habitation around the Brisbane River, and notably at the site now known as Musgrave Park.Jagara (also known as Jagera, Yagara, and Yuggera) and Yugarabul (also known as Ugarapul and Yuggerabul) are Australian Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland.  There is some uncertainty over the status of Jagara as a language, dialect or perhaps a group or clan within the local government boundaries of Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. The languages of Greater Brisbane are related \u2013 there is uncertainty over which dialects belong to which language. The Yugarabul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Brisbane City Council, Ipswich City Council and the Scenic Rim Regional Council.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Moreton Bay area was initially explored on behalf of European colonisers by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named \"Red Cliff Point\" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay. In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.Oxley claimed, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km (12 mi) upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore. The party settled in Redcliffe on 13 September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km (17 mi) south, which offered a more reliable water supply. The newly selected Brisbane region, at the time, was plagued by mosquitos.After visiting the Redcliffe settlement, Sir Thomas Brisbane then travelled 45 km (28 mi) up the Brisbane River in December 1824. Governor Brisbane stayed overnight in a tent and often landed ashore, bestowing upon Brisbane City the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake. Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838 and the population grew strongly thereafter, with free settlers soon far outstripping the convict population. German missionaries settled at Zions Hill, Nundah as early as 1837, five years before Brisbane was officially declared a free settlement. The band consisted of ministers Christopher Eipper (1813\u20131894) and Carl Wilhelm Schmidt and lay missionaries Haussmann, Johann Gottried Wagner, Niquet, Hartenstein, Zillman, Franz, Rode, Doege and Schneider. They were allocated 260 hectares and set about establishing the mission, which became known as the German Station. Later in the 1860s many German immigrants from the Uckermark region in Prussia as well as other German regions settled in the Bethania- Beenleigh and Darling Downs areas. These immigrants were selected and assisted through immigration programs established by John Dunmore Lang and Johann Christian Heussler and were offered free passage, good wages, and selections of land.The penal settlement under the control of Captain Patrick Logan flourished with the numbers of convicts increasing dramatically from around 200 to over 1000 men. He created a substantial settlement of brick and stone buildings, complete with school and hospital. He formed additional outstations and made several important journeys of exploration. Logan is infamous for his extreme use of the cat o' nine tails on convicts. The maximum allowed limit of lashes was 50; however, Logan regularly applied sentences of 150 lashes.Free settlers entered the area over the following five years, and by the end of 1840, Robert Dixon began work on the first plan of Brisbane Town, in anticipation of future development. Queensland was separated from New South Wales by letters patent dated 6 June 1859, proclaimed by Sir George Ferguson Bowen on 10 December 1859, whereupon he became Queensland's first governor, with Brisbane chosen as its capital.In 1893, Brisbane was affected by the Black February flood, when the Brisbane River burst its banks on three occasions in February and again in June in the same year, with the city receiving more than year's rainfall during February 1893, leaving much of the city's population homeless.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nOver 20 small municipalities and shires were amalgamated in 1925 to form the City of Brisbane, governed by the Brisbane City Council. A significant year for Brisbane was 1930, with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the Shrine of Remembrance, in ANZAC Square, which has become Brisbane's main war memorial. These historic buildings, along with the Story Bridge which opened in 1940, are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city.\nDuring World War II, Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called MacArthur Central) was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to Hollandia in August 1944. MacArthur had previously rejected use of the University of Queensland complex as his headquarters, as the distinctive bends in the river at St Lucia could have aided enemy bombers. Also used as a headquarters by the American troops during World War II was the T & G Building. About one million US troops passed through Australia during the war, as the primary co-ordination point for the South West Pacific. In 1942, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.Postwar Brisbane had developed a \"big country town\" stigma, an image the city's politicians and marketers were very keen to remove. In the late 1950s, an anonymous poet known as The Brisbane Bard generated much attention on the city which helped shake this stigma. Despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The state government under Joh Bjelke-Petersen began a major program of change and urban renewal, beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs. Trams in Brisbane were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969, leaving Melbourne and one line in Adelaide as the last Australian state capitals to operate trams until Sydney begun operation of a new system in 1997.\n\nThe 1974 Brisbane flood was a major disaster which temporarily crippled the city. During this era, Brisbane grew and modernized, rapidly becoming a destination of interstate migration. Some of Brisbane's popular landmarks were lost to development in controversial circumstances, including the Bellevue Hotel in 1979 and Cloudland in 1982. Major public works included the Riverside Expressway, the Gateway Bridge, and later, the redevelopment of South Bank, starting with the Queensland Art Gallery.\nBetween 1968 and 1987, when Queensland was governed by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose government was characterised by strong social conservatism and the use of police force against demonstrators, and which ended with the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption, Brisbane developed a counterculture focussed on the University of Queensland, street marches and Brisbane punk rock music.\nBrisbane hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1988 World Exposition (known locally as World Expo 88). These events were accompanied by a scale of public expenditure, construction, and development not previously seen in the state of Queensland. Brisbane's population growth far exceeded the national average in the last two decades of the 20th century, with a high level of interstate migration from Victoria and New South Wales.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAfter three decades of record population growth, Brisbane was hit again by a major flood in January 2011. The Brisbane River did not reach the same height as the previous 1974 flood, but still caused extensive damage and disruption to the city.Brisbane also hosted major international events including the final Goodwill Games in 2001, the Rugby League World Cup Final in 2008 and again in 2017, as well as the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit.\nPopulation growth has continued to be among the highest of the Australian capital cities in the first two decades of the 21st century, and major infrastructure including the Howard Smith Wharves, Roma Street Parklands, Queens Wharf, the Brisbane Riverwalk, the Queen's Wharf casino and resort precinct, the Brisbane International Cruise Terminal, the Clem Jones, Airport Link, and Legacy Way road tunnels, and the Airport, Springfield, Redcliffe Peninsula and Cross River Rail railway lines have been completed or are under construction.\n\n\n== Geography and environment ==\n\nBrisbane is in the southeast corner of Queensland. The city is centred along the Brisbane River, and its eastern suburbs line the shores of Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea in the Pacific Ocean. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the Great Dividing Range, with the Taylor and D'Aguilar ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the Moreton Bay floodplain between the Gold and Sunshine coasts, approximately from Caboolture in the north to Beenleigh in the south, and across to Ipswich in the south west.\nThe Brisbane River is a wide tidal estuary and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are brackish and navigable. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at Moreton Bay in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the North Pine and South Pine rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the Pine River estuary at Bramble Bay, the Caboolture River further north, the Logan and Albert rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and tributaries of the Brisbane River including the Bremer River in the south-western suburbs, Breakfast Creek in the inner-north, Norman Creek in the inner-south, Oxley Creek in the south, Bulimba Creek in the inner south-east and Moggill Creek in the west. The city is on a low-lying floodplain, with the risk of flooding increased by the many suburban creeks which criss-cross the city.\nThe waters of Moreton Bay are sheltered from large swells by Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands, so whilst the bay can become rough in windy conditions, the waves at Moreton Bay beaches are generally not surfable. Unsheltered surf beaches lie on the eastern coasts of Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands islands and on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast to the north and south. The southern part of Moreton Bay also contains smaller islands such as St Helena Island, Peel Island, Coochiemudlo Island, Russell Island, Lamb Island and Macleay Island.\nThe city of Brisbane is hilly. The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the Herbert Taylor Range, such as the summit of Mount Coot-tha, reaching up to 300 m (980 ft) and the smaller Enoggera Hill. The D'Aguilar National Park, encompassing the D'Aguilar Range, bounds the north-west of Brisbane's built-up area, and contains the taller peaks of Mount Nebo, Camp Mountain, Mount Pleasant, Mount Glorious, Mount Samson and Mount Mee. Other prominent rises in Brisbane are Mount Gravatt and nearby Toohey Mountain. Mount Petrie at 170 m (560 ft) and the lower rises of Highgate Hill, Mount Ommaney, Stephens Mountain, and Whites Hill are dotted across the city.\nMuch of the rock upon which Brisbane is located is the characteristic Brisbane tuff, a form of welded ignimbrite, which is most prominently found at the Kangaroo Point Cliffs at Kangaroo Point and the New Farm Cliffs on the Petrie Bight reach of the Brisbane River. The stone was used in the construction of historical buildings such as the Commissariat Store and Cathedral of St Stephen, and the roadside kerbs in inner areas of Brisbane are still manufactured of Brisbane tuff.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\n\nBrisbane is located within the South East Queensland biogeographic region, and is home to numerous Eucalyptus varieties. Trees considered iconic to Brisbane include the Moreton Bay fig, a very large evergreen banyan with imposing buttress roots named for the region which are often lit with decorative lights in the inner city, as well as the jacaranda, a subtropical tree native to South America which line avenues and parks throughout Brisbane and bloom with purple flowers during October, referred to locally as 'jacaranda season'. Other trees common to the metropolitan area include Moreton Bay chestnut, broad-leaved paperbark, poinciana, weeping lilli pilli and Bangalow palm. Some of the banks of the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay are home to mangrove wetlands.\nBrisbane is home to numerous bird species, with common species including rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, galahs, Australian white ibises, Australian brushturkeys, Torresian crows, Australian magpies and noisy miners. Common reptiles include common garden skinks, Australian water dragons, bearded dragons and blue-tongued lizards. Common ringtail possums and flying foxes are common in parks and yards throughout the city, as are common crow butterflies, blue triangle butterflies, golden orb-weaver spiders and St Andrew's Cross spiders. The Brisbane River is home to many fish species including yellowfin bream, flathead, Australasian snapper, and bull sharks. The waters of Moreton Bay are home to dugongs, humpback whales, dolphins, mud crabs, soldier crabs, Moreton Bay bugs and numerous shellfish species.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBrisbane has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot, wet summers and moderately dry, moderately warm winters. Brisbane experiences an annual mean minimum of 16.6 \u00b0C (62 \u00b0F) and mean maximum of 26.6 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F), making it Australia's second-hottest capital city after Darwin. Seasonality is not pronounced, and average maximum temperatures of above 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) persist from October through to April.\nDue to its proximity to the Coral Sea and a warm ocean current, Brisbane's overall temperature variability is somewhat less than most Australian capitals. Summers are long, hot, and wet, but temperatures only occasionally reach 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) or more. Eighty percent of summer days record a maximum temperature of 27 to 33 \u00b0C (81 to 91 \u00b0F). Winters are short and warm, with average maximums of about 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F); maximum temperatures below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) are rare.\nThe city's highest recorded temperature was 43.2 \u00b0C (109.8 \u00b0F) on Australia Day 1940 at the Brisbane Regional Office, with the highest temperature at the current station being 41.7 \u00b0C (107.1 \u00b0F) on 22 February 2004; but temperatures above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) are uncommon. On 19 July 2007, Brisbane's temperature fell below the freezing point for the first time since records began, registering \u22120.1 \u00b0C (31.8 \u00b0F) at the airport station. The city station has never dropped below 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F), with the average coldest night during winter being around 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F), however locations in the west of the metropolitan area such as Ipswich have dropped as low as \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) with heavy ground frost.In 2009, the current Brisbane weather station recorded its hottest winter day at 35.4 \u00b0C (95.7 \u00b0F) on 24 August; however, on the penultimate day of winter, the Brisbane Regional Office station recorded a temperature of 38.3 \u00b0C (100.9 \u00b0F) on 22 September 1943. The average July day however is around 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) with sunny skies and low humidity, occasionally as high as 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F), whilst maximum temperatures below 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) are uncommon and usually associated with brief periods of cloud and winter rain. The highest minimum temperature ever recorded in Brisbane was 28.0 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F) on 29 January 1940 and again on 21 January 2017, whilst the lowest maximum temperature was 10.2 \u00b0C (50.4 \u00b0F) on 12 August 1954.Annual precipiation is ample. From November to March, thunderstorms are common over Brisbane, with the more severe events accompanied by large damaging hail stones, torrential rain and destructive winds. On an annual basis, Brisbane averages 124 clear days. Dewpoints in the summer average at around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F); the apparent temperature exceeds 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on almost all summer days. Brisbane's wettest day occurred on 21 January 1887, when 465 millimetres (18.3 in) of rain fell on the city, the highest maximum daily rainfall of Australia's capital cities. The wettest month on record was February 1893, when 1,025.9 millimetres (40.39 in) of rain fell, although in the last 30 years the record monthly rainfall has been a much lower 479.8 millimetres (18.89 in) from December 2010. Very occasionally a whole month will pass with no recorded rainfall, the last time this happened was August 1991. The city has suffered three major floods since its founding, in February 1893, January 1974 (partially a result of Cyclone Wanda), and January 2011 (partially a result of Cyclone Tasha).\nBrisbane is within the southern reaches of the tropical cyclone risk zone. Full strength tropical cyclones rarely affect Brisbane, but they do occasionally. The biggest risk is ex tropical cyclones which can cause destructive winds and flooding rains.The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from 21.0 \u00b0C (69.8 \u00b0F) in July to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in February.\n\n\n== Urban structure ==\n\nThe Brisbane central business district (CBD, colloquially referred to as 'the city') lies in a curve of the Brisbane river. The CBD covers 2.2 km2 (0.8 sq mi) and is walkable. Most central streets are named after members of the House of Hanover. Queen Street (named in honour of Queen Victoria) is Brisbane's traditional main street and contains its largest pedestrian mall, the Queen Street Mall. Streets named after female members (Adelaide, Alice, Ann, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Mary) run parallel to Queen Street and perpendicular to streets named after male members (Albert, Edward, George, and William).\nThe CBD's squares include King George Square, Post Office Square and ANZAC Square (home to the city's central war memorial).\nBrisbane's metropolitan area is broadly and colloquially divided into the 'northside' and the 'southside', with the dividing line being the Brisbane River, as crossing one of the fifteen bridges across the river is required to travel to the opposite side by land transport. This results in many areas which are south of the CBD being classified as located in the 'northside', and vice versa, as a result of the river's winding trajectory. In addition to being classified as located on the 'northside' or 'southside' there are further broad and colloquial regions such as the 'westside' for some areas to the southwest of the CBD and the 'bayside' for areas located on the coast of Moreton Bay.\nGreater Brisbane had a density of 148 inhabitants per square kilometre (380/sq mi) in 2016. Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of apartment developments, including mid-rise and high rise buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in separate houses, 12.6% lived in apartments, and 10% lived in townhouses, terrace houses, or semidetached houses.\n\n\n=== Parklands ===\n\nBrisbane's major parklands include the riverside City Botanic Gardens at Gardens Point, Roma Street Parkland, the 27-hectare Victoria Park at Spring Hill and Herston, South Bank Parklands along the river at South Bank, the Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Mount Coot-tha and the riverside New Farm Park at New Farm.\nThere are many national parks surrounding the Brisbane metropolitan area. The D'Aguilar National Park is a major national park along the northwest of the metropolitan area in the D'Aguilar Range. The Glass House Mountains National Park is located to the north of the metropolitan area in the Glass House Mountains and provides green space between the Brisbane metropolitan area and the Sunshine Coast. The Tamborine National Park at Tamborine Mountain is located in the Gold Coast hinterland to the south of the metropolitan area.\nThe eastern metropolitan area is built along the Moreton Bay Marine Park, encompassing Moreton Bay. Significant areas of Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands also covered by the Moreton Island National Park, Naree Budjong Djara National Park and the Bribie Island National Park respectively. The Boondall Wetlands in the suburb of Boondall include 1100 hectares of wetlands which are home to mangroves and shorebirds as well as walking tracks.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBrisbane has retained many heritage buildings, some of which date back to the 1820s, including The Old Windmill in Wickham Park, built by convict labour in 1824, which is the oldest surviving building in Brisbane, and the Commissariat Store on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used as a grainhouse, and is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane and contains a museum. Other 19th and early 20th-century buildings of architectural significance include the Treasury Building, City Hall, Customs House and the Land Administration Building.\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as Queenslander architecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large verandahs, gabled corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few terrace houses being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature Queenslander-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\nBrisbane is home to several of Australia's tallest buildings and it is ranked among world cities with the most skyscrapers. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. Brisbane's tallest building is currently Brisbane Skytower, which has a height of 270 metres.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBrisbane's Greater Capital City Statistical Area includes the Local Government Areas of City of Brisbane, City of Ipswich, Moreton Bay Region, Logan City and Redland City, as well as parts of Lockyer Valley Region, Scenic Rim Region and Somerset Region, which form a continuous metropolitan area. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the population of Greater Brisbane is 2,514,184 as of June 2019, making it the third largest city in Australia.\n\n\n=== Ancestry and immigration ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:\n\nThe 2016 census showed that 32.2% of Brisbane's inhabitants were born overseas and 50.9% of inhabitants had at least one parent born overseas.

It is the 3rd busiest port in Australia for value of goods. Container freight, sugar, grain, coal and bulk liquids are the major exports. Most of the port facilities are less than three decades old and some are built on reclaimed mangroves and wetlands. The Port is a part of the Australia TradeCoast, which includes the Brisbane Airport along with large industrial estates located along both banks at the mouth of the Brisbane River.White-collar industries include information technology, financial services, higher education and public sector administration generally concentrated in and around the central business district and satellite hubs located in the inner suburbs such as South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley, Spring Hill, Milton and Toowong.\nBlue-collar industries, including petroleum refining, stevedoring, paper milling, metalworking and QR railway workshops, tend to be located on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River proximal to the Port of Brisbane and in new industrial zones on the urban fringe.\nTourism is an important part of the Brisbane economy, both in its own right and as a gateway to other areas of Queensland, as international education, with over 95,000 international students enrolled in universities and other tertiary education institutions in the central Brisbane City Council local government area alone in 2018.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail in the CBD is centred around the Queen Street Mall, which is Queensland's largest pedestrian mall.

          "We saw this Museum reviewed in Trip Advisor as we were in Brisbane we decided to take a look. The Civic Hall itself is a stunning and huge Art Deco building built in 1930, the Museum is well organised and at the time we visited had two retrospective exhibitions, one on music",
          "Was looking for things to do to kill time and see the city a bit and stumbled upon a free tour of the clock tower and entry into the museum. The museum was nice, minimalistic, just a quick walk around for about 5-10 minutes. I did notice a dedicated space to keep children busy",
          "We done the clock tower tour which was amazing getting to see the city from a height and learn about the structure of the bells along with the history of it all. We also looked around the art gallery quickly as our tour was the last of the day and we didn't realise it closed the",
          "I am a local so I go relatively often. There are always incredible displays featuring local artists, or displays of lcoal history in the most engaging and fascinating way. I am always incredibly inspired. And, an added bonus is the incredibly well curated gift shop featuring",
          "We did the clock tower tour - it's short but fascinating and well worth a visit to the top so you can look over the city. Annie our tour guide was awesome. We loved it",
          "City hall tour was outstanding. The host (Dominique) was so knowledgeable with the history of the building, architectural styles, and art history. Brilliant!",
          "Located inside the City Hall, you must enter and turn right, get the elevator to the rooftop and you will find yourself inside the Museum of Brisbane. Discover Brisbane's history and, if you have time, donate to help maintain the Museum of Brisbane working!",
          "Interactivity is somewhat limited to floor prancing and one or two buttons to push.One floor out of action.Not really enough for kids interactivity.Staff should get some of those crusty old displays and make them touchable after all rocks weathered well so far.",
          "We went here for the Brisbane women in Art exhibition- fascinating- but also had some time to look at the First Nations aspect-also fascinating. A great museum, always worth a visit",
          "I visited this museum with Master 9yo and we were both a bit underwhelmed. There was very minimal that kept us interested so it took us around 15minutes to walk around and see everything. We did not visit the paid display & reviews suggest this is good. The clock tower, however",
          "Saw the new woman exhibit it was interesting recognizes the lives of Brisbane women artists over the past 100 years If you can do a tour it free and I think you would get more out of it Great gift shop",
          "The \u201cHigh Rotation\u201d music feature at City Hall Museum is sensational. If you have enjoyed your Brisbane music and local bands over the past 40 years then (thanks Molly Meldrum) do yourself a favour and devote a couple of hours or more to this musical exhibition.",
          "Not a lot of exhibits only being on the 3rd floor, rugby function on during our visit on ground floor, we could hardly get in past all the hoo has, cafe on ground floor very quaint and interesting with excellent staff,",
          "The Art collection is just a part of the City Hall complex and is worthwhile to spend some time to enjoy the Art works on display - very relaxing and informative.",
          "A great free outing for all ages and nice to learn about the female artists of the Brisbane region, the clock tower tour was so interesting and admittedly the focus of our visit, and the views did not disappoint.",
          "We sppent an hour or so at the Museum which was certainly enough. Can get quite busy during midday so be aware. Better to go in a group. Free entry too!",
          "We stopped by on our first day to Brisbane and popped in right before it was closing. It has great history of the origins of the city. Really great info - it's free and well done.",

          "This is a very small museum about the History of Brisbane that has some interesting information. In the future, I hope that they are able to expand their collection to include more objects or replicas showing how the early settlers lived, and how the local First Nations people",
          "Lots to see and learn and was extremely busy. You have to get in early during school holidays and it can be noisy. Worth a visit.",
          "The museum come art gallery located on the 3 rd floor of the City Hall provides a wonderful opportunity for children and adults to demonstrate their creativity. Exhibitions also exist that warrant viewing.",
          "The museum is a must see when visiting Brisbane. Go up in the morning to book the free trip up to the clock tower and spend time either before or after in the museum. It is very small compared to other museums I have been to, and you could easily go through it within 10-15 mins",
          "We had a lovely couple of hours to spend here while waiting for our clock tower tour and really recommend it, but be aware, once in the clock itself you don't leave the lift and it is very quick so be ready with that camera.",
          "A very interesting and varied range of exhibits and articles on display on the 3rd floor of City Hall",
          "Well presented display of Brisbane's early history. All displays are self explanatory, so you can take your time, but the film with William McInnes as the narrator was particularly interesting.",

          "Visited the museum today to see the Nasa Human space experiment ...what a brilliant display of space memorabilia & a part of an exciting time in history. We also wandered around the museum after visiting the exhibit to see a large display of other artifacts not space related.",
          "Museum of Brisbane\u2019s an interesting one in that it\u2019s run quite differently to the other museums and public galleries in town. As a result they often have really interesting, quite niche, exhibitions that the others wouldn\u2019t. And their collection is amazing. Lately it\u2019s started",
          "Great deal of history... Of the building, and therefore the town. We took the clock tower tour as well, which was certainly worth our time.",
          "I always visit the museum every couple of months for the different exhibits. Plus there is always the City Hall clock tower to visit as well.",
          "This turned out to be a huge flop. It\u2019s nothing more than a very abbreviated history of Brisbane in a few old pictures. The video was clever and informative but too short, too selective, too blinkered. The whole experience takes no more than 20 minutes max. It needs a whole lot",
          "We started the morning with a tour of the City Hall building. Then headed up stairs to view the Museum. And have enjoyed 2 different displays there. We also checked out the Clock tower tour.",

          "We have been here a few s times over the years, but this one was the most disappointing not much of anything to see or do. Paid to enter science centre should of thrown money into the street would of been more exciting.",

          "Although the Museum is small, it is definitely worth a visit. Enhance your stay by doing a historic tour of this amazing building, and also taking the original lift up to the clocktower on a clocktower tour. All free - a wonderful asset for the city.",
          "Situated in the city hall near Queens street. The building itself is superb of old era. Musuem is a must visit to know about development of Brisbane. Do visit when you are in CBD.",
          "Visited the museum to see something of the history of Brisbane but it actually has very little on display other than photos and a video. Much of the exhibition space was taken up with an art gallery which seemed to have no obvious connection with the history of Brisbane. This",
          "The museum is located at the city hall. It is a small museum that showed history of how Brisbane becomes a city among other things. It is free and well maintained. You can probably spend 1-2 hours in there.",
          "Visit the museum and during the visit were asked if we wanted to go up the tower. We accepted the tickets (limited to 7 people per tour) but had to return 2 hours later and had a great tour of the clock tower and were amazed by the views. Clock tower was the highlight of our day.",
          "Did you know that Brisbane began when fourteen convicts were sent up north because of prison crowding in Sydney? This is just one of the facts which you will learn about at the Museum of Brisbane. The clocktower is somewhat dwarfed these days by the surrounding skyscrapers, but",
          "Wonderful city place to visit. Cute 30s coffee place then view the architecture of City Hall tour the clock tower and now see the stunning Easton and Pearson fashion archive exhibition. Great way to spend an afternoon",
          "If you don\u2019t know much about Brisbane\u2019s history, this museum is an excellent starting point. It\u2019s free and very informative. Some of the galleries were closed when we were there, but that\u2019s to be expected with museums when they change exhibits. Great gift shop!",
          "I went to the museum to see the convict history exhibit. Unfortunately, that ended before I got there. It's a small museum that has bell tower tours, but don't go on a hot day as the ancient elevator doesn't work in high heat, so no tours.",
          "I have lived in Brisbane most of my life and it was only recently that I went into the Museum of Brisbane. It was fantastic to see the displays that they have in there and learn more about this city I call home.",
          "We had a good time here, very interactive museum and full of interesting and fun things to do, book a trip to the tower visit as worth doing.",
          "It's a great museum and housed in the beautiful City Hall which was renovated a few years ago. Great displays and interaction. Very informative. They don't like you bringing a back pack as I had travelled from the Sunshine Coast for the day by train it was essential. I",
          "This is a cute little museum with some nice displays. Especially liked the one at the start showing the map of the city and some of its landmarks and the ones with the Aboriginal stories and history. Well maintained and worth a visit if you have an hour to spare in the",
          "We had a camp for children with disabilities and the museum staff were fantastic not only on the day but also in the lead up to the event. Trying to organise so many children was difficult but they assisted us in all ways they could. Many thanks to the museum staff.",
          "This is a free walk through time, your very own TARDIS machine! The information is very well collected, informative and respective of the traditional owners, it is located in the revamped Town Hall which it self is a fascinating visit. Don't miss this, great on a hot day,",
          "Ever-changing exhibits of local history & culture. I have seen some amazing exhibits, extremely informative, educational & interactive. Watch short films, shop for local gifts, take a tour, talk to the knowledgeable & friendly staff. Go up the clock tower & combine your",
          "Located in city hall, the museum gives a good overview of Brisbane\u2019s history with good interactive displays. The museum is free. It has a small bookshop/ gift shop. I estimate the casual visitor could spend about an hour there, perhaps combining the visit with a tour of the",
          "lovely place to take kids and relax peacefuland relaxng but a bit pricey to see some of the desplays that you bring in",
          "My tip is to cater a few hours when you are here, if you are a history buff. You can check out the interior of the city hall and also do the tour of the clock tower while you are here.",
          "Useful place to visit to get out of the rain for a short period of time. Free entrance, it will probably occupy people for an hour or so. So much more could have been added, I felt there was a big lack of infortimation pertaining to the Aboriginies and their way of life along",
          "Really good pictorial development of Brisbane city and region over the years. Especially the pictures and effects of the floods that have been through (we actually were in Brissy during the 2011 floods, so good to see what other areas were like that were affected). Some nice",
          "I'm a bit of a city nerd so I loved the chance to learn a bit about Brisbane's colourful past. The location in City Hall is a plus too.",
          "The museum is a creative informative place to visit. There is amenitites and a restaurant. The exhibitions of our history are presented in an interesting and easy way to understand . I was very impressed and recommend this as a must see experience.",
          "I think this Museum is largely unknown. Probably much confused with the larger Queensland Museum at Southbank. Shame because it's quite special. It's not very big and that's it's charm! Perfect for a regular visit in Town so keep an eye on changing exhibits! A beautiful space,",
          "The Life of a Convict exhibition was ok, but felt it could have delved deeper still, like giving more visual insight to the period. 100% Brisbane was quirky but couldn't hold my attention. In regards to the world of museums this one had limited exhibitions, we went to the",
          "Museum inside City Hall. City Hall and it\u2019s clock tower are worth a visit in their own rights, but the museum was the standout for us. An excellent way to obtain a short and interesting understanding about Brisbane. The history of Brisbane and the current exhibition about the",

          "The museum is located on the third floor of City Hall in King George Square just off Adelaide Street. Whilst it is fairly small in size, the content is most interesting and the layout good. There's currently an exhibition called Life in Irons, which details the workings of the",

          "Entry is free to this lovely little modern museum on the third level of City Hall. Lots to see and we were very impressed by the interactive Life In Irons exhibition about convict life in the early years of Brisbane. When you enter you can get a card with a name on it and",

          "Enjoyed a couple of hours here, which was time well spent. The exhibits were interesting but there is a lot to read, so be prepared to spend a while on this task. The only down side was the lack of a seat - standing for so long was harsh on the legs and back. Minor issue as,",
          "Great place to take the kids on the weekend or school holidays. Plenty of things for them to do and see.",
          "Have been to here for twice. Love the history of Brisbane itself. You can join the tour inside of the museum so you could have a look at the clock tower and main auditorium.",

          "I really enjoyed how the museum was located directly in city hall. One of the best things is that it is free! Be sure to come a bit earlier if you want to schedule a clock tower/museum tour at a time that is convenient of you. The clock tower tours are nice because they are",
          "and interesting to walk through and check out the exhibits providing information about the city's background history and growth.",
          "A small but very interesting museum in the City Hall which provides a lot of local history and usually a quality art exhibit profiling the local area. Well worth including in your schedule.",

          "This museum is not as well know as the Queensland museum and is smaller, but definitely worth a visit. They always have slightly different and interesting exhibitions, with the only negative being that space is a little tight",
          "We noticed the displays had changed significantly since our first visit a few years ago. In fact it had changed in the month since our arrival in Australia. It always seems like a calm and cool haven from the heat and rush of the city and the museum contains a lot of interest",
          "Visited the Meuseum of Brisbane in the City Hall on 3rd March 2017 as part of an international group. Exposition in made up quite good, showing Brisbane short history (at least short for someone whose place of birth finds its first mentioning in documents at 800 and now works in",
          "My main purpose for visiting this Museum, which is located on the third floor of Brisbane City Hall, was for a Clock Tower tour. I arrived with a few minutes to spare so walked around the Museum. Really interesting and informative in terms of providing a history of Brisbane",
          "My wife and visited the Museum of Brisbane as a result of Googling the 'Brisbane Museum'. As it turns out there are two museums, the one at South Bank and one in the Brisbane Council building. Anywhere whilst in the CBD we decided to have a look although we were after the",
          "I found it quiet boring to be honest, Mainly just paintings and information on walls. Also one of the lifts does not go to the ground floor from the third floor unless you work in the building. This should be labelled as I had no idea and nor did some other people.",
          "Free admission is great. Small but pretty good displays of a lot of interesting animals and items etc",
          "Visited briefly and although this is a small museum, we found plenty to keep us occupied for the hour or so we were there. For anyone interested in the history of Brisbane city from early through to modern times, this is the place to go. Admission is free.",

          "The museum was very interesting and easy to get to. The 100% Brisbane exhibition was very informative and interactive. I could have easily spent another hour reading all the information. We uncovered the hidden bonus of a tour in the clock tower. This was very interesting",
          "The museum was well curated. We especially liked the video overview of Brisbane's history. After seeing the museum you can view various of the items shown during the video. There was also an exhibit of modern Chinese art - which was interesting. Especially liked the",
          "We did the museum, city hall and clock tower tours today and it was fantastic. A big thank you to Brian who is a fantastic tour guide with so much passion for what he does. He is extremely knowledgeable and made our afternoon amazing. We really suggest you do all the tours.",

          "A modern approach to curation and story telling, my impression of the MOB is \"quietly thoughtful\" in its approach to events and exhibitions. Located in the recently restored historical Town Hall, the building alone is worth a visit.",
          "Good place to visit. Mix of established and special displays. Easily accessible in the city hall Brisbane",
          "The displays, video presentations and interactive displays did a great job in presenting the history of Brisbane. The indigenous history was very interesting and insightful as was the harsh history of the convict era. The more recent history of the formation of the City of",

          "Once you finally find the museum, it is a great place to spend a couple hours and learn about Australia/Brisbane. The interactive displays are great and made things more interesting. The video they had on the war had my emotions going, it was a great display. The clock tower",

          "Nice relaxing place to take a friend to learn more about Australia and the culture of Brisbane. For a local its is the norm, but for a visitor there is a lot to read and learn about the first Australians in the area and the building of a city.",
          "Great hidden find in Brisbane Interactive and historical would recommend to locals and visitors as a must do - city hall building",
          "The current exhibition 100% Brisbane is excellent. We combined this visit with a concert in the main auditorium, but if you haven't been up the clock tower, do book a tour. The view is lovely and NOT scary. We had to go back a second time to see all the museum offered and it was",
          "Visited the museum with my family on the 06 Dec 2016. The museum is free-of-charge for all for both locals and tourists. The museum provides a lot of information about the Australian people, some Australian/ International art pieces + the history of the founding of Brisbane",
          "The museum is great but the highlight was the tour to the clock tour in the ancient lift, Worth the wait. Great views of the city too.",
          "The Museum of Brisbane is located inside City Hall. Just walking into City Hall is so beautiful. Once you get out on the 3rd floor you are immediately met with a modern gallery. Good to go around at your own pace and get more insight to Brisbane's history",
          "This museum was small, but interesting. The real gems, though, were the free tours (advanced booking recommended) of the clocktower (going up an old-fashioned lift, and having a good view of the city), and of city hall. Our guide for the city hall tour shared with us interesting",
          "Have been a few times now and interesting to see the different exhibitions that they have as well as revisiting the pictures and history of our beautiful city.",
          "The kids had an awesome time here, all was free except for a new exhibit. The exhibits were great and very informative. The ladies at the main desk were very informative and professional and provided us great advice for what to see while at the museum.",
          "Hadn't been to the Museum for many years and was totally impressed with the variety of exhibits over the 3 levels. The Museum Shop is well stocked and not overly expensive. The display of dinosaur relics and information was really good as were the displays of fauna of the",
          "Yes, parking is hard to get so please do visit Brisbane on a Sunday if you are driving. Parking is only A$5.00 for the whole day at the King George car park which is just below the City Hall . Museum. We visited Brisbane a second time on a weekday and was shocked that many of",
          "Interesting ways of getting people to know Brisbane. I liked the section where you could sample smells of Brisbane, according to its inhabitants.",
          "The only negative was trying to find the parking garage. After driving around for half an hour trying to find the cheaper parking we ended up parking two blocks away and had to pay $50 for two hours parking because the cheaper parking was not signposted very well.",
          "You can probably see this museum in an hour. The exhibits were really interesting when I was there & the museum is free. I did the \"museum highlights\" 30 min tour when I first got there, then went back to the exhibits I wanted to spend more time in. Worth a visit!",

          "Visited to see an exhibition on architecture and it was very good. The museum is located within the historic City Hall which is really nice! We left our bags in the cloak room before heading up the lift to the museum. While a small musuem, it is very interesting and gives you a",
          "What a find! If you want to understand more about Brisbane and Australia's culture and history, this is the place for you. It's beautifully laid out, and if you are looking for a comfortable place to rest a while, there are armchairs where you can chill out.",

          "Had time to fill in while waiting for a flight after checking out of the hotel, Had a stroll around the museum which is well laid out and free in most areas. Worth a look and cafe coffee nice.",
          "The way in which the story of brisbane is done in this display is well coordinated and structured, the visitor is presented with a good factual amount of information not to heavy, not too soft either and it's done in such a way that it makes the history come alive for the",
          "It is a small museum providing historical information about the City of Brisbane including plenty to read. Tours of the clock tower via the original 1930's lift can be booked. The museum is located in the restored City hall building that is worth a visit just to see the",

          "a very interesting place and near our hotel but hard to find, a wonderful suggestion from the concierge and a wonderful way to understand the city history",
          "Finding the Museum of Brisbane was a challenge. It is hidden away on the third floor of the City Hall building and only the determined find it. It is somewhat random in its selection of displays but the selection that are made are well produced",
          "Go see this wonderful exhibit to learn more about Brisbane folk as well as the general Aussie state of mind. You can catch a free highlights tour before spending some time taking in more of the displays. There is a children's area, as well. Great place to get out of the rain",
          "It's one of those things you look at all of the time (get it) but never stop to appreciate. Make the time, book in and do the tour of the clock tower. Give yourself a couple of hours, so that you can appreciate the museum displays and the fab little giftshop.",
          "Marvellous pictures and stories from Brisbane's past - like the big floods of 1893, 1974 and 2010. And the days when trams ran over an extensive network around the city to provide public transport. Also, the impact of the construction of the Story Bridge, and its purchase by",
          "An excellent stop as they have some great displays and there is no charge either. Also do the clock tower visit while there. Great views.",
          "There were quite a few tourists here the day I was here, but it is also interesting for a local person to see Brisbane from years ago and why things are named as they are.",
          "The building and Town Hall are impressive on their own, but venture up to level 3 and you are in for a treat of contrasts. Currently on show until 19 February 2017 - \"Ink Remix\" - ink art from China Taiwan and Hong Kong - a new trend in Asian art with some lovely works and",
          "Spent a lovely few hours here looking at the various displays that contained some fascinating information and excellent images, art work and historical pieces. The Museum of Brisbane, not to be confused with the Qld Museum at Southbank, is in the fabulous City Hall building at",

          "Found while visiting City Hall, confused with the statistics part but probably interesting if you have time to watch the show. A few interesting artefacts from early Brisbane days",
          "I enjoyed looking at the display about the war as well as the architecture.There were three displays on last time I visited and it was great to see a variation ,how lucky was I. The presentation on the war was amazing and it gave wonderful examples of how difficult life was for",
          "I love the MoB! It is a small, yet informative museum that enables visitors to get a bit of Brisbane history as well as art. It is a good size to not take too much time, so it is easy to fit into a day travel plan. A good place to get some quality souvenirs (albeit a bit",

          "Located in Third Floor of Town Hall, in King George Court area, you will definitely be pampered with different story of Brisbane as a River City. Sit back and relaxed, and you'll be amazed by story of Brisbane on a huge screen and interactive features on its wall. Try to get",

          "Nice little museum. I was interested more though in the clock tower with its clock and workings and the oldest lift in Australia.",
          "I was surprised by this hidden gem. Sure, it's not the MET, but it offers some really good insights into the history of Brisbane city as well as some great exhibitions. Great also for wet weather escapes",
          "Brisbane History only. Don't go there with any great expectations, still some interesting facts and artwork were found, depends on what you call boring as far as these types of places go..It is free though.",
          "great way to spend hours just time wasting - or just enjoying looking at all the interesting items of exhibition",
          "Worth a visit for an hour or so. On arrival book a session to visit the clock tower, then browse the exhibits until your session time. The clock's internal workings are quite interesting and the guides are informative. The clock tower is the key attraction here IMO, but city",

          "A bit of a hidden gem in Brisbane - find it on the third floor of City Hall and the friendly staff welcome you with open arms. This is a museum of social history through presentation, not a collection of lots of objects, but is no worse for this - if you want to know all about",
          "Visitors to the Museum of Brisbane will be pleasantly surprised by the Museum (social History no dinosaurs) itself if you can find it. Once you enter city hall you need to take the lift to the 3rd floor (the signage on the ground floor as not great). The space is great and",
          "Starting your trip to Brisbane at the City Hall seems logical - the Museum displays change throughout the year and the short trip up the clock tower is a bonus. Go to the third floor to meet the friendly staff or look online to plan your visit in conjunction with the free tours",
          "This is a really fascinating museum. I only just moved to Brisbane and I learnt a lot about my new City. I'd highly recommend the City Hall tour and the short Clock Tower tour. Our guide pointed out so many interesting parts of City Hall and we got to go into places that are off",
          "Well displayed material detailing city's origins, characters, growing pains, the 3 floods, and changing face. Free tour to the top of the clock tower, often a queue. We enjoyed lunch in the quaint old Shingle Cafe on the ground floor.",

          "Brisbane Museum is quite a good day out. I've been to the museum several times, and enjoy the different exhibits. Whilst it has many great features, and it is well worth the visit, it is one of the smallest museums I've ever been to. That being said, it would be fantastic for",

          "The visit can be as short as 30mins or as long as one chooses to stay. The exhibits are hand-out and interactive, and offers information that allows visitors to know Brisbane better and even intimately. Do not forget to ask for ride to clock tower where one will not only see",
          "A small museum in a beautiful building with a surprisingly worthwhile offering. While planning to catch up with friends for coffee in the square, we made time to pop into the museum, specifically to do the clock tower tour. This is a free 15min. tour that does require you book",

          "Situated on the 3rd floor of City Hall the Brisbane Museum is very small however the entrance fee is free so it is well worth the visit. I presume it is only new so it will probably get bigger in time. We went to the WW1 exhibition which was really good and gave a good insight",
          "The museum is modern and well laid out, albeit quite small. Whist there are exhibits that could be of interest to young children, this wouldn't be my first choice for a family day out. Somewhere like the Museum of Queensland across the river has interactive displays that are",

          "A Free Attraction A Must See, in the heart of the CBD what isn't there to like? In the same building as the council chambers, what a magnificent building. A elevator ride passing the workings of the clock. This lift is the original since 1930 and is 92 meters high. My tip is go",
          "Worth going to if you are based in the CBD. For out of town Brisbane suburbs worth catching the bus or train to. Always difficult to park in the city. Clock tower tours can book out quick so worth booking online. Check out what's featuring at the museum first as it tends to be a",

      "name": "Story Bridge",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Story Bridge is a heritage-listed steel cantilever bridge spanning the Brisbane River that carries vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic between the northern and the southern suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is the longest cantilever bridge in Australia.\nThe road across the bridge is named Bradfield Highway. The bridge connects Fortitude Valley to Kangaroo Point. The Story Bridge opened in 1940 and was tolled until 1947. It is named after prominent public servant John Douglas Story.\n\n\n== History ==\nGiven the early settlement of Kangaroo Point, there is a long history of residents wanting a bridge between the Brisbane CBD and Kangaroo Point. Even while the first Victoria Bridge was being constructed between North Brisbane and South Brisbane in 1865, several hundred people were petitioning for a second bridge to be built from the Customs House to Kangaroo Point. In 1888, a meeting was held in the Brisbane Town Hall to demand a bridge connecting either George Street, Albert Street or Edward Street via the City Botanic Gardens with any loss of the land from the gardens to be potentially compensated by removing Government House.\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nA bridge downstream of the Victoria Bridge was part of a larger plan, devised by Professor Roger Hawken of the University of Queensland in the 1920s, for a series of bridges over the Brisbane River to alleviate congestion on Victoria Bridge and to divert traffic away from the Brisbane central business district. The William Jolly Bridge was the first of the Hawken Plan bridges to be constructed. Lack of funds precluded the construction of the downstream bridge at that time. Initially plans called for a transporter bridge further downstream near New Farm.\nIn 1926 Kangaroo Point was recommended by the Brisbane City Council's Cross River Commission. Subsequently the bridge was constructed as a public works program during the Great Depression. The cost was to be no more than \u00a31.6 million.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nBefore the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 the Government of Queensland asked John Bradfield to design a new bridge in Brisbane.\n\nThe Queensland Government appointed John Bradfield on 15 December 1933 as consulting engineer to the Bureau of Industry who were in charge of the construction of the bridge. In June 1934 Bradfield's recommendation of a steel cantilever bridge was approved. The design for the bridge was based heavily on that of the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal, completed in 1930. On 30 April 1935 a consortium of two Queensland companies, Evans Deakin and Hornibrook Constructions, won the tender with a bid of \u00a31,150,000.Construction on the bridge began on 24 May 1935, with the first sod being turned by the then Premier of Queensland, William Forgan Smith. Components for the bridge were fabricated in a purpose-built factory at Rocklea. There are 1.25 million rivets (metal pins or bolts) in the Story Bridge. During its construction, work sometimes continued 24 hours per day. The bridge has only one pier on the northern bank but two piers on the lower southern bank, one to bear the weight (the main pier) and, further to the south, one to prevent the bridge from twisting (the anchor pier). There was no need for an anchor pier on the northern bank as the bridge was anchored into schist cliff face. The primary challenge in constructing the bridge was the southern foundations that went 40 metres (130 ft) below ground level. It was not possible to excavate to that level as water from the level would rapidly seep in. So a pneumatic caisson technique had to be used. As men were working under pressures of up to 4 times normal air pressure, a decompression period of almost 2 hours was needed at the end of each shift to avoid the bends. An on-site air lock hospital successfully treated the 65 cases of the bends that occurred. On 28 October 1939 the gap between the two sides was closed. A concrete decking was then laid, covered by a Trinidad pitch topping. The bridge was painted and sodium lighting was installed. The bridge approaches were also prepared.Three men died during the construction of the bridge. On 22 November 1937, Hans James Zimmerman slipped and fell 75 feet (23 m) to the ground. On 7 February 1939, Alfred William Jackson fell from the bridge into the river. Although pulled from the water alive, he died 4 hours later in hospital without regaining consciousness. On 6 December 1939, Arthur McKay (Max) Wharton was hit by a piece of equipment on a nerve that made him faint, falling from the bridge to the water; 18 months earlier Wharton had been hailed as a hero for saving another worker from falling from the bridge.\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nUntil it was completed the bridge was known as the Jubilee Bridge in honour of King George V. It was opened on 6 July 1940 by Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, Governor of Queensland and named after John Douglas Story, a senior and influential public servant who had advocated strongly for the bridge's construction.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe bridge carries an average of 97,000 vehicles each day. The Story Bridge carries three lanes of traffic in either direction as well as a shared pedestrian and cycle way flanking each side. The road on the bridge is called the Bradfield Highway. It is not to be confused with the Bradfield Highway that spans the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nInitially a toll of sixpence (5 cents) was charged to use the bridge, with toll booths constructed at the southern end of the Bradfield Highway. The toll was removed in 1947. Between 1952 and 1969 trolley-buses operated by the Brisbane City Council used the bridge.\nFollowing completion of the bridge, an expressway was constructed on the southern side of the bridge (opened 18 May 1970), and a tunnel/loop was constructed at Kemp Place on the northern side (completed 10 July 1972).\n\n\n== Maintenance ==\n\nResurfacing works were undertaken in 1994.The Story Bridge was closed to traffic from midnight of Friday 3 January 2014 until 5.30 a.m. Monday, 6 January 2014, for essential maintenance work of resurfacing all six lanes.Closure for maintenance occurred again from 9 p.m. Friday 27 April 2018 until 5 a.m. Monday 30 April 2018.\n\n\n== Role in contemporary Brisbane ==\nThe Story Bridge features prominently in the annual Riverfire display and is illuminated at night.\nIn 1990 road traffic was halted so pedestrians could celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bridge's construction. The bridge was again closed to road traffic on 5 July 2015 to celebrate the 75th anniversary. The celebration attracted almost 75,000 visitors to the bridge who enjoyed food, drink and entertainment as they walked across lanes usually reserved for vehicles.Bridge climbs began in 2005 and have become a popular tourist attraction.A picture of the bridge featured on Brisbane Bitter.\n\n\n== Suicides ==\nSimilar to many large bridges such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Brisbane's Story Bridge has become notorious as a suicide hotspot. Following two high-profile murder-suicides from the bridge in 2011 and 2012, Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk announced plans to install free telephones linked to suicide prevention hotlines. On 6 February 2013, Quirk announced plans to install a three-metre-high safety barrier. Overall the plan cost about $8.4 million and was completed in December 2015.\n\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.In 1988, the bridge received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia.In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Story Bridge was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \"structure and engineering feat\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAustralian landmarks\nClem Jones Tunnel\nJacques-Cartier Bridge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStory Bridge at Structurae\nStory Bridge under construction, 1939 This photo is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland.

          "Fortunate enough to be staying almost in the shadow of this bridge in the course of our stay, a really impressive sight and particularly pretty at night. A walk over provides excellent views of the river and the city skyline. A walk back provides a good opportunity to burn off",
          "My hotel room faces the bridge and it looks good especially at night. My colleague who brought us around the city humbly stated that this is Brisbane's Harbour Bridge in reference to Sydney's famous landmark but I begged to differ. This bridge has its own unique character and",
          "Loved my daily walk on it, felt secure when crossing it, clean and beautiful view. Don't miss it!!!!",
          "Story Bridge is looks beautiful at night.I used citycycle to explore brisbane city one day .I went on story bridge on cycle its very giant.Story bridge gives beautiful view of brisbane river along with CBD.",
          "So much easier to walk over than other large bridges and they decorate it during holidays so it's stunning to see from close up or far.The walk down kangaroo point to the bridge is amazing even tho it's lost a lot of its charms with all the new apartments going up.",
          "My gps took me to where I need to be for one of the new 4,000 virtual caches around the world. I took my needed photo and continued across to the highrise area. A busy bridge both for traffic and pedestrians, bikes.",
          "If you're visiting Brisbane, and want the single photo that sums up your experience, here you go. The Story Bridge is iconic - slightly weird, slightly dated, and a mess during rush hour, but it is a marvel to behold - even more so a night, when its lights are often tuned to",
          "It's not the Harbor Bridge of Sydney, but it does add character to the riverfront of the CBD in Brisbane. You can walk over it to Kangaroo point as well as do a bridge climb.",
          "This engineering achievement gives the visitor the opportunity to explore under and over its structure. You can easily walk the bridge, take the steps down to ground level and pop into the iconic Story Bridge Hotel for lunch or dinner taking in one of the many beers on offer.",
          "Well after spending a few times driving over the bridge and its really nice to see, I also had the chance to go under it using the standard water bus service.",
          "Haven't done the \"tourist\" climb as yet but can recommend a walk across the Storey ...... that's f you've a head for heights. A good walk is along Eagle Street, over the bridge and along South Bank. ( after that, you'll deserve a beer or an ice cream)",
          "A true piece of history, constructed during the depression to provide jobs and still serving an active role in everyday travel for its locals. You can walk along it, drive over it or if you feel adventurous walk up and over it. At night it is lit up with coloured lights and",
          "Sat very near this beautiful bridge and what a lovely setting. These bridges are so wonderful and the engineering blows your mind.",
          "The bridge is part of the vast cycle and walking pathways that meander around and over the Brisbane River. The bridge connects two great parts of the city which include cafes, bars and restaurants.",
          "Beautifully lit up at night....different colours and great to see in the day. Great for walking from cbd to kangaroo point",
          "We took the City Cat to Bulimba and went under the Story Bridge. It is great to see from the water as you get to see its construction up close. From the riverbank it is big and imposing. I believe it is lit at night time but I did not get to see it.",
          "Cross this bridge and head to Kangaroo Point! Just across the city and you'll find lots of areas to relax, and appreciate Brisbane's skyline. It's a beautiful bridge, specially in the evenings.",
          "The lights on the bridge add to the beauty of the city in the evening. So pretty at night. Everything about this place is designed to make spectacular views",

          "The bridge is a Brisbane icon. It looks fantastic all lit up at night & is great to view from the river whilst travelling on the city cat. There are safe separated paths to walk & cycle across the river. I was lucky enough to complete the bridge climb at sunset many years ago &",
          "Stayed at Oakwood apartments for 2 nites overlooking Story bridge when the Origin match was on The Bridge was lit orange one Nite and Maroon the next...would have loved to be there on a fireworks event...Very relaxing to sit back on the balcony watching workmen strolling across",
          "Taking a taxi across the river via the Story bridge provides a quick tour of both sides of the river. A 30 minute trip will take you on a full circle of inner Brisbane.",
          "The bridge walk is quite good. Good view of the city and the river. From the bridge, you can walk along the north bank towards east for a great view of the bridge.",
          "Unmistakably Brisbane when you see this. Yes you can walk across, or go under it by boat, or drive across, or sit at a restaurant and admire its architecture and lighting by night. Beautiful always.",
          "Lovely bridge for a pedestrian walk and fantastic views. Easy access from CBD or Southbank end. Also nice to cruise down the river on a ferry day and night and get great photos, especially at night as it is lit up. Most often in a colour them to celebrate relevant events",
          "I see the story bridge every time I use the CityCat and it is just incredible to see and go under. It is definitely one thing to see whilst visiting Brisbane.",
          "Viewed the bridge from a river cruiser and it was a great sight. It was built during a depression on a design similar to the Sydney Harbour Bridge (rivets and all!)",
          "Drove across the bridge yesterday and I haven't done that in quite a while, the structure is truly amazing =, make sure when you drive over it if you are the passenger that you look up, there's also walking paths on either side of the bridge so you can take in the sights from",
          "Story bridge really does make brisbane look that little bit more impressive! Having lunch or dinner looking at that Bridge is absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend having a look or taking a river ferry, you will learn so much about the history of this bridge.",
          "Located on the Brisbane River, this bridge offers walking tours also on the top of the bridge. Beneath the bridge is the river which is surrounded by good walkways and restaurants. There are cruises going in from one side to another, place is fantastic in the evenings with",
          "The walk over the Story Bridge provides you with great views of the Brisbane River, Southbank and the city. Crowded with traffic as are most cross city bridges it is still worth a visit. At night, they do a great job of lighting the bridge and its a great photo opportunity.",
          "Nice to walk across, also you can climb the bridge. the Kangaroo Point side has the story Bridge Hotel & gets busy on the w'end.",
          "It does provide some good views of the Brisbane River and the City of Brisbane but it is an ugly old bridge that has problems coping with the traffic. If you are in that part of brisbane it is worth a walk across.",
          "If you walk over the story bridge at night you get a nice view of the river. It is a little impeded due to the wire netting in place to stop jumpers however you get a nice view of the lights of the city on both sides of the river.",
          "Margret and I could see the story bridge from our accommodation and just had to incorporate it in out lengthy walk. It was a wonderful idea and gave us a fantastic new perspective on the Brisbane River.",
          "A bit like a mini Sydney Harbour Bridge but nothing spectacular to be honest. Unless you do the organised bridge walk which is pretty expensive nothing special and very busy with traffic. Goodwill Bridge is better.",
          "Viewed at a distance from one of dozens of vantage points around the city OR Walked across via a Bridge Cimb you will be inspired by this bridge which unites the City. It intreagues tourists and artists alike with numerous images displayed around the world.",
          "The story bridge is small and is in world standards offers nothing special. They have a bridge climb offered but I would really think this would be a waste of money as the bridge is small as its only about 74 meters high and it doesnt offer views which can be bar beter obtained",
          "The bridge has a bit of history. However the full glory of the bridge is visible during night and that too from the river front. Its an awesome sight to look.",
          "I love Story Bridge and the history behind this Iconic Bridge is even more interesting. The lights over the bridge of a night are awesome and change every evening, or light up certain colours for certain occasions.",
          "Best place to view this bridge is from Story Park and Eagle Pier. The view is great during the day but at dusk, the bridge gets lighted up. They also have an adventure Bridge climb for those without fear of heights. One of the highlights in Brisbane.",

          "Always good to drive across it but this time we decided to take our beautiful dog for a walk across the Story Bridge on a lovely Autumn day as the sun was shining and the weather was quite warm...lovely to see the cars zipping by as we strolled across",
          "We booked accommodation with a view of the Story Bridge. It looks very impressive, especially at night when it was all lit up. Later during our stay we sailed under it aboard a free City Hopper. We were impressed all over again!",
          "I was horrified to see that while crossing this bridge, cyclists are speed limited to 10 kph. I am not sure if they were being serious or having a joke in saying this. The path was relatively narrow and is not sufficient for a 'shared' path.",
          "very nice bridge, very similar one is in Kalcata city, the bridge has very nice night lights on the structure itself",
          "What can i say.....its a bridge, you drive over it. Not exactly what i would come to brisbane to see. Its not syney harbour bridge.",

          "It was hard to get staffto come near you. Incomplete meals served, not happy to do anything about it",
          "Go underneath the Bridge..Take the Mains Road and Turn left just before the Bridge. Be aware there is a Speed Camera too on a 60kmph zone. You can have nice views of the bridge. Parking is free on the weekend. Plenty of free street parking after hours on weekdays and on the",
          "Climbed the storey bridge a year or so ago - was an amazing experiebce- highly recommend it to anyone.",
          "Going on the Big Wheel was fun, plus the beautiful pools provide a chance to cool off and relax, and there are so many great places to eat and relax",
          "If you want to take pictures of the Story Bridge from a different perspective head over to Fortitude Valley. Walk the local streets and take in the great views of the river and Story Bridge.",
          "Beautiful light up at night, spend some time strolling the wharf at night or a meal with a view of the bridge.",
          "I've enjoyed the Story Bridge on all of my stays in Brisbane and Kangaroo Point. I would absolutely recommend the climb or the walk. Very much worth while.",
          "This iconic steel cantilever bridge connects Fortitude Valley to Kangaroo Point through Bradfield Highway (15). The bridge not only carries vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic but also offers some adventurous activities for the visitors.",
          "Good view from the Cat as you come up to and pass under it. Also has a cheaper bridge climb than SHB although we did not do this Make sure you see it at night too",
          "yap it had his history, but only stays in history, not worth a while, no thing expected here, just passed by on the boat",
          "Went at night. the park was really quiet but the views were stunning especially when the bridge and the surrounding buildings lit up. a really romantic place to be at. =) Shall return to this place for its sunrise the next time.",
          "You can either choose to climb the bridge or just take the walkway. Depends on what you want to do. I chose to walk it since I am on a budget. Nice view of the river, city and the park.",
          "Interesting design, and as you walk across the bridge you get a great view of the city and both banks of the river, especially the Maritime Museum.",
          "It's not as big, striking or as well known as the Sydney Harbor Bridge, but it is an iconic piece of the Brisbane skyline. The Brisbane river practically circles the city so this is an important part of the commuting Brisbaner's day. You can climb it, but at the very least",
          "So much for the 7.50 am Express Bus from Tingalpa to Ann Street in the City. Peak hour traffic and a virtual standstill on The Story Bridge. This is one of several bridges spanning the Brisbane River but appreciating it during peak hour traffic is not quite my scene....",
          "Soo cool to see during the Christmas holiday nights !! The walk on the bridge offers great views of the city and a great workout Too!!!",
          "Interesting design, but not anything out of the ordinary. Would not go out of way to see. Just OK as an attraction.",
          "This is a great bridge to walk, day or night. There is a little caf\u00e9 in the middle. The views of the river are really good. The bridge is lit up at night. It is a good way to get to South Bank and the Maritime Museum.",
          "Apparently designed by the same engineer as the Sydney Harbour Bridge! You can hire the bridge for $50,000 for 4 hours too....so the river commentary told us...",
          "Under or over it a historical part of Brisbane. Daughter did the bridge climb and said it was wonderful. Used to be the main road to coast coming from thee North now we have alternative bypasses.",
          "I enjoyed visiting this majestic bridge and an icon of Brisbane. Its been years since Ive visited this bridge. I lived in Brisbane up to 12 years ago. It is heritage-listed and the longest steel cantilever bridge (It spans the Brisbane River) in Australia. This bridge was",
          "Went over this bridge by Taxi - was quite picturesque looking from both sides of the bridge up river.",
          "Decent venue, drinks are well priced and crowd is decent. Had an incident where I was racially profiled by the manager in front of a group of 12 witnesses and issued with a dismissive/hushed apology. The company didn't even respond to my complaint.",
          "Got the chicken schnitzel with mushroom sauce, chips n beans. The schnitzel was tasty and a reasonable size. Everything else looked like it belonged on a kids plate. The mushroom sauce was about 1 table spoon over a big schnitzel and didn't cover anything and when I asked for",
          "We went under the Story Bridge on the free City Hopper Ferry. We learned the history of the bridge when we visited the Brisbane Museum. It is the longest cantilevered bridge in all of Australia. It is an impressive looking bridge.",

          "do not drive past or on the story bridge and think again what it is like to view the city from on top of the bridge.just do the bridge climb. you will not be disappointed.",
          "Walked over the bridge from Fortitude Valley and into town. There's some great views when you cross the bridge of many of the cities high rises and some of the parks along the river. Its pretty busy with traffic but a good wide path keeps you safe. It's the first place iv'e seen",
          "While the Story Bridge is synonymous for many with Brisbane, in itself it's a fairly unremarkable cantilever bridge.",
          "Story bridge carries a huge amount of vehicular traffic. Despite this it is possible to walk over on the foot ways. It is a bit noisy . The inland side offers good views of the Brisbane river and the CBD",
          "Include the Storey Bridge in your walk along the river. Walking paths over the Bridge and along both sides of the river. Be a little bit more keen and jog. While your on the bridge go for a bridge walk to the top",
          "We have climbed this bridge a few times. What a amazing experience. Also a good walk from the city to visit the other side of the river",
          "Beautiful bridge to see at night. The lighting is like a show accenting the bridge. Also some nice eateries in the area to visit, sit outside and view the bridge.",
          "This bridge is a Brisbane icon and should be driving over or gone under when your in Brisbane. The bridge lights up in nice colours and looks good from Eagle Street Pier.",
          "What a beautiful sight when the sun goes down and the bridge comes to life, at times its almost magical and of course at river fire when the fireworks cause a water fall from the Bridge its spectacular. Have to admit that during the day its not much to look at but in the",
          "The Story Bridge is one of the main attractions that defines Brisbane. It is not the Sydney Harbour bridge though.",

          "This is a majestic landmark bridge with history. Easy walk over so nice to include on a trip into city on a cooler day.",
          "Not a difficult climb but worth it for the views and to say you climbed it. Helpful guides with full instructions before you climb and they are with you every step of the way.",
          "the lights at night are amazing they change color and look fantastic well done Brisbane you can either climb or just cross the bridge with a walk to the Eagle street pier where you can enjoy some wonderful food at resturants",
          "Visted the Bridge on many occations , always pleases. Have seen the bridge in many colours but the Christmas colours were brilliant. Never seen it change colourrs before till New Years Eve.",
          "I took a ferry in the evening and got an awesome view of the bridge as it was lit up for the night. The lights against the evening sunset wss definitely a good photo op for those with a camera. If not its still a beautiful view to see as you head fown the Brisbane river",
          "Nice bridge over the river connection from city to Kangaroo Point - the pub under it is worth a visit",
          "This iconic bridge is one of the best known and most loved landmarks in Brisbane which is fast becoming known as the City of Bridges. The Story Bridge was opened in 1940 and was named after a prominent local Public Servant, John Douglas Story. It connects the Brisbane CBD area",

          "It is really just a bridge that is nicely lit at night. It is also nice to incorporate it into your walk or bike ride around the city.",

          "We had a good view of the storey bridge from the 71st floor of the meriton apartments in Adelaide street - their lighting display at night is beautiful. Recommend going for a walk along the boardwalk alongside the river from Eagle street over the bridge to Kangaroo Point",
          "We actually walked from Eagle St pier to the story bridge, then walked on the bridge across to Kangaroo Point cliffs and then walked along the river path to Southbank Parklands. We started our walk in late afternoon and by the time we reached Southbank, it was already night. We",

          "This is an iconic structure of Brisbane that connects the north and south of Brisbane. I think the best view of the bridge is from the river walk that runs underneath it and on both sides, especially the city side. At night it is lit up in different colours usually representing",

          "The Story Bridge is a huge icon of Brisbane and makes for some spectacular views. It is particularly pretty at night when it lights up in a multitude of colours. The lights are often themed to whatever events are going on, such as Green and Gold whenever Australia is competing",

          "Sydney was what sold Australia to me in the first place, and half of that was the beauty of the harbour, including the bridge, but moving to Brisbane and I am even more impressed with Story Bridge, it feels less clumsy, incorporates itself into the city more, is free, and is lit",

          "We did the Story Bridge twilight ascent a while back. It was superb! We had a great guide who told us all about the bridge's history, while showing complete concern throughout for our safety (no dangers and you're well harnessed). The views are spectacular at nighttime.",
          "I understand that we need to help suicidal people but what a shame the story bridge now has that cage around it.used to love the 'free' feeling you got when walking or cycling across it.i guess if it stops one person it's worth it. The view is amazing and a must do if visiting",
          "Great views of the city and inner suburbs as you walk (although just a tad noisy from the traffic). Highly recommend, particularly as there's lots to see at either end of the bridge. A stroll around the park on the southern side is also really nice.",

          "Story Bridge is one of those things that wse learnt about in primary school, so it was quite a thrill to walk across the bridge. Story Bridge is one of Australia's most famous bridges. It is not as famous as the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but in many ways it is just as grand. It",

          "As far as a bridge is concerned, it does the job I guess. When staying in the Stamford Plaza, we had a good view of the Story Bridge lit up at night and it was pleasant enough but I probably wouldn't consider it to be a tourist attraction as such.",
          "The Story Bridge in Brisbane is the longest cantilever bridge in Australia spanning the Brisbane River. Run walk or drive across it like you would a bridge, they do offer a bridge climb but we were unable to do that while we were here.",
          "It does not look very attractive during the day but looks good at night. It is close to the city and there is a walk and it is worthwhile to get a different perspective of the river and the city.",
          "Great for a walk up or over through the day, but to look at not so much. At night which ever your vantage point it's gorgeous lit up. You can't see it from Mt Coot-tha so don't try. Definitely a Brisbane icon",
          "Easy walk over the bridge, or bike ride...on the pedestrian path of course! You can also do a bridge climb but that's a whole other review ;)",
          "haven't seen it at night, nice to see but not tooo special. You can see the bridge from the Botanical Gardens.",
          "Fantastic at night time with lighting along it. If driving over it great views to be seen. Enjoy sites of Brisbane and surrounds.",
          "Being an icon of Brisbane city, this bridge is the only one you can climb besides the harbour one in Sydney. Great views of the river and city skyline at dusk and dawn.",
          "Walking across at night and you will see the beautiful city lights, easy to get to and a short and safe walk across.",
          "We get the luxury of being able to see this great landmark from our living room. It's such a great view when it's lit up at night. It is a shame they had to put the fences on but it's for everyone's safety so it's a good thing at the end of the day",
          "Loved looking out at this bridge last time I was in Brisbane so enjoyed walking on it again. Did not do adventure climb but that would have been cool. It was a bit windy so wasn't keen. Nice to have such beautiful bridges in the centre of the city",
          "I wanted to visit Story Bridge because my husband has told me about a great night of dining there when he was on a business trip. I felt disappointed when we got there because I expected it to be a busy hub of shops, hotels and pubs, not so. It is a bridge and there is somewhere",
          "I climbed the bridge with my Mum a couple of years ago. My mum's dad was one of the construction guys who worked on the bridge. It was a very emotional time for my Mum. We chose the sunset climb and as the sun set the city's lights came alive. A truly great sight.",
          "Saw this bridge lit up at night when catching the city hopper ferry last night. Looks quite nice at night and is one of many brilliant bridges crossing the river",
          "Hardly compares to some of the greats, Sydney Harbour, Golden Gates ect, but it does what it's supposed to do (span a river)",
          "The bridge is an Iconic feature of the Brisbane Skyline. At night time the bridge is lit up to make a spectacular site and can be seen from many vantage points along the river",
          "One of the icons in Brisbane - Check out the bridge at night as it will be lighted up. It is beautiful in its own way.",
          "Well, it's not the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Golden Gate but it has it's own charm, especially when it's lit up at night. Travelling under it in the CityCat gets everyone with their cameras out for a photo and lots of selfies. It's quite impressive. There is a bridge climb",
          "From where do you want to visit? If from Brisbane River by ferry you can stop at Thornton St Wharf and walk to the south end of the bridge, approx. 200m walk then do the bridge strolling on the west side pedestrian path. Or if you come from Fortitude Valley Train Station, do the",
          "For many years an icon of brisbane. Lit at night in varied colours. Fantastic on Riverfire night in September. Can be climbed.....look for groupon discounts etc.",
          "A cloudy day. A rainy day. It rained and stopped, rained again. Found a good site in the neighbouring housing estate (near Bowen Street / Malt Street) for a good photograph of Story Bridge. No tourist, little people, a quiet environment with few joggers. From this site, can",
          "The story bridge adds a wonderful touch to the Brisbane city sky, more so at night, when the bridge looks well decked. I was staying near the Fortitude valley, my routine would be to have a wonderful dinner at the multitude of eateries here, then go for a long walk to view the",
          "The Story Bridge is Brisbanes' most iconic landmark and is easy to get to. There are several different ways of seeing the bridge, walking over it, taking one of the many boats that travel under it, or if adventurous and brave enough can climb it, at various time throughout",
          "Lovely to cruise the river under the Story Bridge in Qld. Paddleboats and meals while enjoying views are always a winner. Good commentaries on the boat connected the history of this bridge to Sydney. Most interesting.",
          "I've been fortunate to live in several places with a view of the Story Bridge. It's fabulous at night, especially now that the lights can be changed regularly. It lights up my evenings and always makes me feel good.",
          "Storey Bridge is mandantory to see when you are visiting Brisbane. It gives you the real feeling for the history of the place",
          "We liked this bridge as it appears small and functional in the middle of the city. It runs from the southbank area to the city and has pedestrian access. Adds interest to the Brisbane skyline.",
          "Circumnavigated the city on foot. Got a great view while crossing the river on this bridge. Good old steel structure still standing",
          "Beautiful at night, especially on a dinner cruise. Worth a photo or 2 to remind you of Brisbane. Otherwise, it is like several other bridges and unremarkable.",
          "We didnt do the Story Bridge Climb but we did however walk across the bridge. It was really high however there are some really good views from up here of Brisbane.",
          "We take overseas visitors here on dusk to view the bats flying en mass overhead, then show them the city lights at night and the cliff top lights from the houses opposite. It's interesting to take binoculars here and really see some of the sights! The boats and ferries",
          "Not as big as other bridges in Australia (Sydney) but very pretty especially at night. We took the picture attached from our hotel room.",
          "We were lucky enough to be given a voucher to climb the story bridge for Christmas. I highly recommend the adventure. It is a hassle free easy to do adventure. I was a little apprehensive as I am afraid off heights but this adventure was so well done I had no problems whatsoever",
          "Story Bridge might have a story behind it... but it certainly is a place where you capture your story of Brisbane tour in your DSLR, Smart phone or handy cam. Click some stunning pictures of Brisbane river, the city and the bridge itself. I stayed on the 68th floor of the",
          "provides great photo opportunities and magnificent landmark for Brisbane. Photos containing Story Bridge demonstrates the many different moods this great city illustrates and certain times of the day.",
          "The backdrop to many a fireworks demonstration - it truly is the equivalent for Brisbane of the the Opera House is to Sydney. You must see it at night and walk across it or jog during the day - the view/s give you a real taste of Brisbane life from the Corporate life to the left",
          "This bridge, apart from being a worthy icon of Brisbane is a photographers delight at any time of the day or night. Well worth the walk to which ever vantage point you choose.",
          "You can climb the bridge, walk cycle or drive across the bridge, sail drive or cycle under the bridge or find a spot on the opposite bank for a stunning view. The bridge was completed in 1940. Named after John Douglas Story, a prominent Queensland public servant. He was born in",
          "The bridge is one of the icons of the city there is a nice area for picnic's by the river. I did the bridge climb the view's are great on a clear day not real cheap but well worth the money. I did the day climb but it would be interesting in the evenings.",
          "still one greatest Sites of Brisbane ,now that city hall has been built out of view by high rise; it still says Brisbane both day & lite up at night 7 NOW THE NEW BRIDGE WLK BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SYDNEY HARBOUR BRIDGE!",
          "It was built en route of a great jogging route that take you along the riversides of Brisbane River. The structure was interesting to look at from different angle day or night.",
          "Although the Sydney Harbour Bridge is much better known, the Story Bridge in Brisbane should be just as well known as it is the longest cantilevered bridge in Australia. The view from the river of this bridge is wonderful. At certain times of the year you can also climb this",
          "At night the bridge is beautifully lit. The bridge looks amazing in the lights which reflect from the river Brisbane.",
          "Our condo was very close to this bridge so we walked back and forth on the bridge into the park area. Very safe, no problems, and it was a nice time. I would not say it's a must do but honestly the walk across and into the park and that area is really pretty, especially the",
          "A new city, a new view. Family mid morning spent walking up, across and down what has to be the second best view of the city (best being by helicopter!). Some people are put off this trip by thinking that it will be hard work. It isn't! It is a really gentle pace, nothing too",
          "Hubby did the climb as part of a work team building exercise. He is not a fan of heights at all but he managed to complete the climb and arrived back home safely with a smile on his face hehe. The climb was leisurely with plenty of time at the top to have a look around and",
          "great views of the city if you take a bridge climb. several options throughout the day - sunrise to sunset - really great at riverfire and new years eve celebrations where it is lit up and fireworks stream off the bridge. also the bridge is lit up every night in different",

          "We learned about Story Bridge in primary school, so it was a thrill to cross it on foot. As for size and length, It's not in the class of San Francisco's Golden Gate, but Story Bridge is a good bridge all the same. It';s a bit like the Brooklyn Bridge. The Story Bridge",
          "We walked over Story Bridge twice in the evening, lovely views of the river & city but it was more difficult to access one side of the bridge which was a slight annoyance for us as our hotel was on that side. All the same enjoyed our walk over the bridge enough to be happy to do",
          "I'm afraid that we were disappointed, having heard about the \"iconic\" bridge of Brisbane. Much smaller than we'd been expecting, and having earlier been to Sydney, it was overshadowed.",
          "We went on a dinner cruise while in Brisbane and saw the Story Bridge all lit up and people doing the climb up, beautiful.",
          "Looming large in the lives of the people of Brisbane this bridge is the backdrop to our stories. It is also very useful if you wish to cross the river.",
          "We left after a scrumptious breakfast at Story Bridge Deli and walked it off by walking to New Farm via the Story Bridge and back. Great views!!",
          "There are 4 things to do to really enjoy this bridge. 1. Take a photo during the day. 2. Take a photo at night. 3. Walk over the bridge and 4. Cross the river and walk under the bridge. Enjoy a great part of Brisbane",
          "What colour will the bridge be tonight? I will alter my route at night just to see the ever changing light display. My favourite was the purple but the multiple colours at Christmas were mesmerizing.",
          "I only saw this from a distance, but it was all lit up in green after dark and makes for a beautiful sight over the river. This is around where the botanic gardens are and follow the path to lots of restaurants.",

          "Not sure that climbing this bridge will add to your experience. We enjoyed just walking over. The views of the Brisbane skyline were great. A great feat of engineering.",
          "a great bridge to walk across and then on the city side cut back underneath and take the newly constructed boardwalk - a very pleasant walk out on the river.",
          "A great bridge - it rivals the Sydney Harbour Bridge in my humble opinion - without the stellar harbour of course!!!. Very busy during peak hours but provides great views of the city skyline. You can even climb the bridge if your energetic enough - look up story bridge adventure",
          "This is known as the story bridge because as you are driving across, wind your window down & listen to the the bridge whispering to you! Also the views to the river & the city are brilliant!",
          "Walk it, ride it or drive it, It's an awesome sight looking over the City by day and lights up at night,",
          "Great views, safe with friendly and helpful staff. Not an option if you have a fear of heights. Coming down at night on the steps are tricky.",
          "For such an important feature of the city it really is beautiful. And as a Brit, finding out it was made by a British company made me like it even more!!",
          "If you like heights and watching the sun go down then the Twilight Climb of the Storey Bridge is the place to be. A breathtaking experience and one you will never forget. It has just as much appeal if you do the climb more than once.",
          "I took my wife for a twilight bridge climb. We watched the weather hoping it would clear up as the climb goes on except for when lightening is about. After the safety briefing we are dressed in overalls and safety harnesses are attached. An Ipod with commentary is available",
          "One can get a good view of this bridge via the ferries that ply the Brisbane River. This bridge links Kangaroo Point to the city centre. It's totally constructed with metal.",
          "Bridge climbing is quite entertaining. You will be at the top of the world, looking at the city all around you. I liked it and Brisbane is one of the few places where you can enjoy that. Of course, if you already have been to Sydney, the story bridge may be disappointing. But if",
          "As with other iconic structures, this bridge gives good views of the city and of the river, on both sides if you walk over. Easy to get to from the ferries from east street pier as we did when staying in the city. After walking over the bridge we went and did the bridge climb as",

          "This is an older bridge which appears to have strength build into it's design. It looks especially nice when lite up.",
          "The old bridge of Brisbane give a great view upon the river (far better than the recent bridges). I found all the \"anti suicide advertisement\" quite funny, but maybe some people see it as a point to do so, so be careful not to look to funny for the cops while visiting it",
          "Story bridge lets you know you are in Brisbane. It is a large commanding structure that is illuminated at night and carries traffic and people across the Brisbane river.. If you are in Brisbane then enjoy it, but in my opinion it's not a destination in itself.,",
          "If you are visiting Brisbane walk across the bridge, it's not as special as the Sydney Harbour Bridge but it's a worthwhile activity if you are there. It's free and takes 10 minutes. Providing you with great views over the river.",

          "You want fast access into the city area and Riverside - use the Story Bridge it's a no brainer! At night they light it up with lights. You can even climb the Story Bridge if you are game. Its not for me I have a fear of heights but hey I love going on the CityCat underneath it.",
          "Who doesn't love a good bridge - works very well at getting you from one side of the river to the other. Love the themed LED lights at night time!",
          "WOW! It's a different world up there! The Story Bridge climb began on the eastern side of the bridge, taking us to the top of the first point. Our terrific guide was Josh, he was informative and really liked his job. We casually climbed the bridge,stopped for a photo-taken",
          "Climbing the Story Bridge is MUCH more affordable than Sydney's Harbour Bridge and still a great experience. I did it at dusk which was perfect, getting to the top in light and returning with the city lights - and this is a spectacular location from which to see the lights. The",
          "Thank you BCC for the fantastic light show on the Story Bridge. The basic colours change each night, but the changing sequences are the best - just delightful.",
          "Easily the 2nd best bridge in Australia. Was impressed when I walked across it as I had only done the Sydney Harbour bridge walk a few months earlier. Walking across this is one of the best things to do in Brissy.",
          "Walk over it - drive over it and look back at the great view of the city. You can even climb the bridge. Also the bridge is often lit in all different colours. Look out for state of orgin... looks great maroon",
          "To locals it is simply a very busy bridge connecting the northern and southern suburbs of the city (Fortitude Valley to Kangaroo Point). It carries a very heavy traffic load during peak hours. Built in 1940, it is heritage listed, carries cars, bikes and has a pedestrian",

          "We did the Story Bridge walk and had an amazing view from the top. We also walked across the length of the bridge when we went to book our tickets. It was warm but there was lovely breeze that kept us cool. Walking over and across ticked another thing off my bucket list.",
          "Not sure how this is an attraction as such as regular Brisbane folk will tell you it's just a bridge - yes a landmark, looks good when lit up but still just a bridge....",
          "I used to run the story bridge and then do the Kangaroo Point stars almost daily. But for those that just want to walk it, take in the scenery go for it, it's worth the effort",

          "Every city has their iconic bridge, and this is Brisbanes. It is often lit up at night, and during festivals changes colours. The bridge climb is a great way to view the city from on high! It is also a major walking/running path for those doing the circuit from Southbank",
          "It links kangaroo Point to the Brisbane mainland, It can be viewed when one takes a ride on the ferry services found there. The ferry will pass underneath it and one will marvel at its magnificent sight.",
          "nice to see at night with the \"skyline of Brisbane\" in the background while doing the boat trip (for free). I really enjoyed the trip there and it was a good start to get to know Brisbane. During day time I already had the full orientation due to the boat trip along the Brisbane",
          "The Story Bridge is a Brisbane icon. It's a beautiful old bridge spanning the river between Fortitude Valley and Kangaroo Point. It's a great spot to view a lot of the cityscape as well as the New Farm/Bulimba riverscape. As a local, I'd suggest a walk over during the day,",

          "Nice bridge with some pretty good views of the city. Slightly concerning to see all the signs saying not to jump, but it's nice that the city cares enough to put them up along with crisis contact numbers! This bridge provides convenient access from the CBD and Fortitude Valley",
          "I lived in Brisbane as a child, and regularly crossed Story Bridge. I don't know if it's Brisbane tradition, or something we just did as a family, but. As you start to cross the bridge you have to start a story which you make up as you go, and you have to finish the story before",
          "Lights up in the evening making for a lovely reflection on the river. We walked on the path it's quite an impressive structure. Its one of the few bridges you can walk across the top of but we didn't this time!",

          "Looking over the Story Bridge by day right now from the heights of the Meriton. Just amazing. Last night the bridge was lit up with purple lights and from my visits to Brisbane the colours change often, specifically when the NRL State of Origin is on it changes to Maroon. Blue",
          "Brisbane offers a free ferry up and down the river - the CityHopper - which offers stunning views of Story Bridge lit up at night. The view of the bridge from the East side is amazing, especially at sunset and twilight. Story Bridge is also a lot of fun to walk or bike over.",

          "We travelled over the bridge a few times and went under it on the Kookaburra Queen paddle steamer, unusual looking bridge but nothing special, lots of Brudges over the BRISBANE river but must admit this one stands out the most, worth a look.",
          "Just another bridge. The design is interesting and you can get some good photos from the river cruises",
          "Quite impressive with views up or down the river as long as your NOT the driver. If able walk across the bridge, take your time and really take in the views. Have lunch on the City side of the river or the Gabba side either side there are some nice restaurants or cafes. A walk",

        "wiki": "Kangaroo Point is an inner southern suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the 2016 census, Kangaroo Point had a population of 8,063 people.The suburb features two prominent attractions, the Story Bridge and Kangaroo Point Cliffs.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKangaroo Point is located directly east across the Brisbane River from the Brisbane central business district, but being on the south side of the river is normally regarded as a southern suburb.\nKangaroo Point is located on a peninsula formed of harder rhyolite rock which the Brisbane River flows around. On the northern tip of the peninsula the Story Bridge connects it to the central business district and the suburb of Fortitude Valley. The suburb of Woolloongabba is located to the south. The six-lane Main Street runs from Story Bridge to Woolloongabba. The landscape of Kangaroo Point is predominantly high rise apartments towards the tip of the peninsula while the southern end is predominantly low-medium density apartments and Queenslander type houses.\nAt the northern tip of the peninsula is Captain Burke Park (27.4653\u00b0S 153.0350\u00b0E\ufeff / -27.4653; 153.0350\ufeff (Captain Burke Park)) with the Holman Street ferry wharf, barbeques, picnic facilities, playground, and outdoor fitness facilities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore British settlement, Kangaroo Point was settled by the Turrbal people. It is one of the earliest suburbs settled in Brisbane and subsequently, is one of Brisbane's oldest suburbs, rich in history and character. It had a reputation for violent and rowdy street gangs around the 1900s, with a number of street riots.In 1823, explorer John Oxley described Kangaroo Point as a \"jungle, fringed with mangroves with the higher land open forest, covered with grass\". During the time of the subsequent convict settlement (1825\u20131841), Kangaroo Point was cleared and used for cultivation of crops. Subsequently, the area was opened up for free settlement, the first land sales taking place on 13 December 1843. Among the early purchasers was Captain John Clements Wickham, the Police Magistrate and later Government Resident. Surveyor James Warner built the first house at Kangaroo Point in 1844.Kangaroo Point's first school was opened in 1861 by the Church of England. It came under the control of the Board of Education in 1867 and consisted of a boys department and a girls department. A separate Girls and Infants school opened on 2 March 1874. This was replaced by the Kangaroo Point Girls School and the Kangaroo Point Infants School which both opened on 20 January 1890. The Kangaroo Point Boys School, Girls School and Infants School closed on 28 April 1950 and amalgamated to become the Kangaroo Point State School. The Kangaroo Point State School closed on 30 June 1965. The site was subsequently redeveloped as a TAFE college, on the corner of River Terrace and Main Street. In January 2010 this site was redeveloped into parkland extending the Kangaroo Point Cliffs Park (27.4753\u00b0S 153.0352\u00b0E\ufeff / -27.4753; 153.0352\ufeff (Kangaroo Point Cliffs Park)).In September 1865, 42 allotments of portion 35 of Kangaroo Point were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Arthur Martin & Co. A map advertising the auction contained a diagram of subdivisions 1 to 31 situated between Ipswich Road and the Brisbane River.St Joseph's Catholic Primary School was founded by Mary MacKillop and opened on 19 March 1870 in Hubert Street in One Mile Swamp (now Woolloongabba) with 70 students. In January 1871, the school relocated to Leopold Street (not Leopard Street) at Kangaroo Point into an unlined timber building with a shingle roof on land provided by James Toohey. In 1879 the Sisters of Mercy took over the operation of the school, following a dispute between MacKillop and the Catholic Bishop of Brisbane.In 1887, the Yungaba Immigration Centre was built on Main Street at Kangaroo Point to replace the poor facilities at the existing centre in William Street.In June 1888, six allotments, being subdivisions 1 to 6 of subdivisions 7 to 11 of portions 68 in the Parish of Kangaroo Point, on Walmsley Street between the Garden Point Ferry and Main Street were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Simon Fraser & Son. A map advertising the auction contained a local sketch by the surveyors, Hamilton & Raff.In September 1928, 19 subdivisions adjacent to the Brisbane River and titled \"Town Reach River Sites\" were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Isles, Love & Co Limited. A map advertising the auction includes an aerial photograph and a panoramic photograph of the area.For many years the suburb was dominated by the factories of heavy engineering businesses, particularly those involved in the maritime industry, such as Evans Deakin, Buzzacott & Co and Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co. Evans Deakin built the largest ship ever constructed on the Brisbane River, the 66,000 tonne oil tanker Robert Miller, which became adrift in the river during the 1974 Brisbane flood. The last vessel to be built by Evans Deakin was an oil rig called Southern Cross. The company vacated the site in 1976, with it later being redeveloped for high-rise accommodation.\nStone was quarried from the cliffs and used as building material. Until the 1930s, Evans Anderson & Phelan built steam locomotives at their Kangaroo Point works for Queensland Railways, however their works were not located near a railway, so the completed locomotives were delivered along Main Street on temporary track.\nUntil the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, the Queensland Navy's main storage facility was located in the suburb. The first ship-based radio transmission in Australia was made between HMAS Gayundah and the buildings in 1903. The naval stores buildings were occupied by the Royal Australian Navy until 1959, and then by the Australian Army until 1984. The heritage-listed buildings are now used by an adventure company focussing on river activities and rock climbing.\nThe opening of the Story Bridge (27.4693\u00b0S 153.0359\u00b0E\ufeff / -27.4693; 153.0359\ufeff (Story Bridge (Kangaroo Point end))) in July 1940 was the most significant development of the suburb. Trolleybuses operated by the Brisbane City Council linked the suburb with Fortitude Valley via the Story Bridge from 1953 to 1969, running along Main Street from Woolloongabba and other eastern suburbs.In 2004 2% of sex workers in Queensland were street prostitutes operating in inner Brisbane suburbs such as Kangaroo Point.In the 2016 census, Kangaroo Point had a population of 8,063 people.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nKangaroo Point is a popular recreation spot, conveniently close to the city and the South Bank Parklands. The Kangaroo Point Cliffs, situated on the east bank of the city bend of the Brisbane River north of the Maritime Museum, opposite Riverstage and the Queensland University of Technology at Gardens Point. The Look-out at Kangaroo Point is also included as one of the stops of Brisbane Transport's City Sights bus service. Kangaroo Point is also home to one of less than 200 Mormon temples in the world {as of August 2015}. Kangaroo Point is also home to Ellis Street, one of the 20 steepest hills in Brisbane according to Brisbane City Council. Kangaroo Point is also home to the more-than-160-year-old St Mary's Anglican Church.\n\nThe cliffs are a popular picnic, rock climbing and abseiling site. The steepness of the cliffs was increased by quarrying operations which mined the volcanic rock or rhyolite lava flows which form the cliffs. The lava was deposited in the Triassic Period about 230 million years ago and filled up an ancient river valley. They currently form the banks of the Brisbane River.\nThe Story Bridge is a prominent landmark. It is able to be climbed with authorised tourist groups and provides the main means of access to the north of Brisbane. Directly under the bridge is the Story Bridge Hotel, and Yungaba, one of Brisbane's most unusual and iconic landmarks.The Kangaroo Point Natural History Project was implemented by the council in 2013 to recognise the contribution by some of Queensland's pioneering scientists and researchers from the area. Along a heritage trail through the CT White and James Warner parks are a series of signs and sculptures to commemorate their lives and work: Cyril Tenison White (government botanist), Frederick Manson Bailey (colonial botanist), Silvester Diggles (naturalist), Oscar Werner Tiegs (entomologist and zoologist), James Warner (surveyor), and Harry Oakman (landscape artist).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nBy bus the suburb is serviced by the South East Busway transit line and buses along Main Street and Shafstons Avenue. By road Kangaroo Point residents rely on the Story Bridge and Captain Cook Bridge for access to the north, and the Southeast Freeway for access to the south. Main Street connects the Story Bridge through the suburb to the South East Freeway. Bicycle paths run along the Brisbane River from South Bank to and over the Story Bridge. The bicycle paths are heavily used by cyclists, roller skaters and pedestrians.\nCityFerry service from the Eagle Street Pier in the CBD and the Sydney Street Pier in New Farm to Holman Street ferry wharf near the peak of Kangaroo Point, Thornton Street ferry wharf on the west side of the point, or Dockside ferry wharf on the east side. CityCat services do not directly service Kangaroo Point.The M7 Clem Jones Tunnel, a toll tunnel, which opened in March 2010, has a connection on Shafston Avenue. It diverts some traffic travelling through the suburb while providing an additional transport route for residents.\nA green bridge was proposed in 2010 to the west to connect Kangaroo Point to Brisibane City and to the east to connect Kangaroo Point to Merthyr Road New Farm, but at March 2020  these projects have not been progressed. The Cross River Rail tunnel is planned to connect under Kangaroo Point Cliffs from Woolloongabba to an Albert Street railway station.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn the 2011 census of Population and Housing, the population of Kangaroo Point postcode area was 7,000 people, in an area of 1.3 square kilometres. The population was 48.3% females and 51.7% males. The median age of the Kangaroo Point population was 35 years of age, 2 years below the Australian median.  53.1% of people living in Kangaroo Point were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 5.2%, England 4.4%, India 1.6%, Ireland 1.6%, Taiwan 1.2%.  69.6% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 1.9% Mandarin, 1.8% Spanish, 0.9% Cantonese, 0.9% Nepali, 0.9% Italian. It has one of the city's highest proportion of residents living in flats, units or apartments (78.8%). Residents in stand alone houses make up only 16.6% of the population. 59.9% of residents are renters while only 18.7% fully own their dwelling. According to REIQ, the median house price in Kangaroo Point for the calendar year 2010 was $658,500.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSt Joseph's Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 26-36 Leopard Street (27.4829\u00b0S 153.0329\u00b0E\ufeff / -27.4829; 153.0329\ufeff (St Joseph's Primary School)). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 318 students with 24 teachers (18 full-time equivalent) and 16 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent).There are no government schools in Kangaroo Point. The nearest government primary school is East Brisbane State School in East Brisbane. The nearest government secondary school is Coorparoo Secondary College in Coorparoo.For tertiary studies, Kangaroo Point is host to Shafston International College and the Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts (ACPA) (which has now moved to the Judith Wright Centre in Fortitude Valley) and was host to a Southbank Institute of TAFE campus until its demolition in 2009. Directly across the river from the cliffs is the Queensland University of Technology (Gardens Point campus) and in an adjacent suburb, the main campus for TAFE Queensland Brisbane (South Bank).\n\n\n== Heritage listings ==\n\nKangaroo Point has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n34 Amesbury Street: former Naval Stores\n94 Baines Street: Raymond Park (West) Air Raid Shelter\n23 Castlebar Street: Shafston House\n116 Holman Street: Holman Street Ferry Terminal\n9 Leopard Street: Lamb House\nLower River Terrace: Kangaroo Point Cliffs\n76 Lower River Terrace: Cliffside Apartments\n102 Main Street: Yungaba Immigration Centre\n255 Main Street: Sunnyside\n261 - 267 Main Street: Silverwells\n433, 447 & 449 Main Street: St Mary's Anglican Church\n2 Scott Street: Scott Street Flats\n69 Shafston Avenue: Leckhampton\n330-334B Vulture Street: St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral\n184 Wellington Road: Raymond Park (East) Air Raid Shelter\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFrederick Manson Bailey, Australian botanist\nPeter Burge, Australian cricketer\nJames Davis, convict and pioneer\nSilvester Diggles, Australian musician and ornithologist\nAlec Hurwood, Australian cricketer\nJohn Lavarack, A Former Governor of Queensland\nFrances Mallalieu Payne (1885-1976) artist and illustrator\nAlfred John Raymond, alderman for Kangaroo Point and mayor of Brisbane in 1912\nCharles Jackson Stewart, (1876-1954) hotel keeper at the Criterion Hotel, George Street\nOscar Werner Tiegs, Australian zoologist\nCyril Tenison White, Australian botanist\nChristopher Wrench, organist\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Kangaroo Point\".

        "wiki": "The City of Brisbane is a local government area over the inner portion of the metropolitan area of Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, Australia. Respectively, the Brisbane City Council has jurisdiction over that area as the local government. Brisbane is located in the county of Stanley and is the largest city followed by Ipswich with bounds in part of the county.  Unlike LGAs in the other mainland state capitals (Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide), which are generally responsible only for the central business districts and inner neighbourhoods of those cities, the City of Brisbane administers a significant portion of the Brisbane metropolitan area, serving almost half of the population of the Brisbane Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA, formerly statistical division).  As such, it has a larger population than any other local government area in Australia. The City of Brisbane was the first Australian LGA to reach a population of more than one million. Its population is roughly equivalent to the populations of Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory combined. In 2016\u20132017, the council administers a budget of over $3 billion, by far the largest budget of any LGA in Australia.\nThe City derives from cities, towns and shires that merged in 1925. The main offices and Central Library of the Council are at 266 George Street, also known as Brisbane Square. Brisbane City Hall houses the Council Chamber, the offices of the Lord Mayor and Deputy Mayor, meeting and reception rooms and the Museum of Brisbane.\n\n\n== Wards ==\nAs of the election in 2020, the twenty-six wards, their councillors and their party affiliations were:\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\nThe City of Brisbane includes the following settlements:\n\n\n=== Inner suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 19\n\n\n=== Northern suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 48\n\n\n=== Southern suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 54\n\n\n=== Eastern suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 28\n\n\n=== Western suburbs ===\n\nTotal: 43\n\n\n=== Moreton Bay ===\n\nTotal: 5\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Government of Queensland created the City of Brisbane with a view to uniting the then Brisbane metropolitan area under a single planning and governance structure. The City of Brisbane Act 1924 received assent from the Governor on 30 October 1924. On 1 October 1925, 20 local government areas of various sizes were abolished and merged into the new city, namely:\n\nCities:\nBrisbane\nSouth Brisbane\nTowns:\nHamilton\nIthaca\nSandgate\nToowong\nWindsor\nWynnum\nShires:\nBalmoral\nBelmont\nCoorparoo\nEnoggera\nKedron\nMoggill\nSherwood\nStephens\nTaringa\nTingalpa\nToombul\nYeerongpillyThe Council also assumed responsibility for several quasi-autonomous government authorities, such as the Brisbane Tramways Trust.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Heritage ==\nThe Brisbane City Council maintains the Brisbane Local Heritage Register, a list of nominated sites that satisfy the Council's heritage criteria.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe City of Brisbane is governed by the Brisbane City Council, the largest local council in Australia. The Brisbane City Council has its power divided between a Lord Mayor, a parliamentary-style council of twenty-six councillors representing single-member wards of approximately 30,000 voters (roughly equivalent in size to state electorates), and a Civic Cabinet comprising the Lord Mayor, the Deputy Mayor (drawn from the majority on Council) and the chairpersons of the seven standing committees drawn from the membership of Council. Due to the City of Brisbane's status as the country's largest LGA, the Lord Mayor is elected by the largest single-member electorate in Australia.  Like all mayors in Queensland, they hold very broad executive power.\nThe seven standing committees of Council are:\n\nCity Planning Committee\nCommunity, Arts and Lifestyle Committee\nEnvironment, Parks and Sustainability Committee\nEstablishment and Coordination Committee (Civic Cabinet)\nField Services Committee\nFinance and Administration Committee\nInfrastructure Committee\nPublic and Active Transport, Economic and Tourism Development CommitteeFollowing local government elections on 28 April 2012, the Lord Mayor and 18 councillors are members of the Liberal National Party while 7 are from the Labor Party with 1 independent.  Graham Quirk of the LNP, was elected Lord Mayor in his own right on 28 April 2012 after having been appointed to the Lord Mayoralty in April 2011 when Campbell Newman resigned to make an ultimately successful bid to become Premier of Queensland. His Deputy Mayor was Adrian Schrinner of the LNP. The day-to-day management of Council's operations is the responsibility of the chief executive officer who is currently Colin Jensen.\nElections are held every four years with ballots for the Lord Mayoralty and the individual councillors being held simultaneously. Voting is compulsory for all eligible electors. The election in March 2004 resulted in the unusual situation of Liberal (later LNP after a July 2008 merger) Lord Mayor Campbell Newman co-existing with a Labor majority on Council and a Labor Deputy Mayor, though this resulted in remarkably few conflicts over civic budgets and Council policy.  The LNP gained a 5.5% swing on the councillor votes in the March 2008 election, resulting in the Liberals taking control of the council as well (Newman won re-election with 60% of the primary vote). Graham Quirk won re-election as Lord Mayor (having been appointed to the position in April 2011) in 2012 with 61.94% of the vote and the LNP gained an additional 3 wards. The last election was held on 19 March 2016. Lord Mayor Graham Quirk defeated Labor's candidate Rod Harding.Following Quirk's resignation in March 2019, Adrian Schrinner was selected as Lord Mayor.The Brisbane City Council operates under the City of Brisbane Act 2010, while other local governments in Queensland are governed by the Local Government Act 2009.\nCouncil meetings are held at Level 2, City Hall, 64 Adelaide Street, Brisbane City every Tuesday at 2pm except during recess and holiday periods. This temporary venue is in use due to the restoration work being performed on the traditional venue Brisbane City Hall. Meetings are generally open to the public.\nBrisbane City Council aims to be carbon neutral by 2026 via the reduction of emissions and carbon offsetting.\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\nThe motto of the City of Brisbane is Meliora sequimur, Latin for We aim for better things. The Council's corporate slogan is Dedicated to a better Brisbane. The City's colours are blue and gold. Its corporate logo was introduced in 1982 in preparation for the Commonwealth Games hosted in Brisbane that year. It features a stylised version of Brisbane's City Hall which opened in 1930. The City's floral emblem is the (exotic) poinsettia and its faunal emblem is the graceful tree frog.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\nBrisbane City Council operate libraries in Annerley, Ashgrove, Banyo, Bracken Ridge, Brisbane CBD (Brisbane Square), Bulimba, Carina, Carindale (Westfield Carindale), Chermside, Coopers Plains, Corinda, Everton Park, Fairfield, Upper Mount Gravatt (Garden City), Grange, Hamilton, Holland Park, Inala, Indooroopilly, Kenmore, Mitchelton, Mount Coot-tha (Botanic Gardens), Mount Gravatt, Mount Ommaney, New Farm, Nundah, Sandgate, Stones Corner, Sunnybank Hills, Toowong, West End, Wynnum, and Zillmere. In addition, it operates a mobile library service to Aspley, Bellbowrie, Brighton, Ellen Grove, Forest Lake, Manly West, Mount Crosby and The Gap. There is also a pop-up library that attends community events and festivals, as well as visiting various parks around Brisbane for children's storytime sessions (a list of dates and places is published some months in advance).\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nThe City of Brisbane has nine sister cities.\n\nNice, France was formerly a sister city of Brisbane until the relationship was severed in 1995 as protest against the Chirac government's decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean. Bangkok became a sister city of Brisbane on 7 May 1997, but is no longer listed as a sister city on the Brisbane City Council website. Brisbane does not have any sister city relationship with any North American, South American, African or any European city.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLord Mayor of Brisbane\nLocal government in Australia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nBrisbane City Council's Organisational Structure\n\"Brisbane and Greater Brisbane\".

        "wiki": "Major General Sir Thomas Macdougall Brisbane, 1st Baronet,  (23 July 1773 \u2013 27 January 1860), was a British Army officer, administrator, and astronomer. Upon the recommendation of the Duke of Wellington, with whom he had served, he was appointed governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825. \nA keen astronomer, he built the colony's second observatory and encouraged scientific and agricultural training. Rivals besmirched his reputation and the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Bathurst, recalled Brisbane and his colonial secretary Frederick Goulburn. Brisbane, a new convict settlement, was named in his honour and is now among the largest cities in Australia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBrisbane was born at Brisbane House in Noddsdale, near Largs in Ayrshire, Scotland, the son of Sir Thomas Brisbane and his wife  Eleanora. He was educated in astronomy and mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. He joined the British Army's 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot in 1789 and had a distinguished in Flanders, the West Indies, Spain and North America. He served under the Duke of Wellington, and in 1813 he was promoted to major general. He saw much action during the Peninsular War, including leading a brigade in the 3rd Division that broke through at the Battle of Vitoria. He continued as a brigade commander in the War of 1812, where in 1814 he led a brigade at the Battle of Plattsburgh, which Brisbane claimed they could have won if they had been allowed to launch a full infantry attack.During the battle, he used the Charles C. Platt Homestead as his headquarters. For his services in the Peninsula, Brisbane received the Army Gold Cross with one clasp for the battles of Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, Orthez, and Toulouse; and the silver war medal with one clasp for the Nive.\nIn November 1819 he married Anna Maria Hay Makdougall of Makerstoun, Roxburghshire, Scotland. On his father-in-law's death, Brisbane assumed the additional surname, becoming Makdougall Brisbane.\n\n\n== Governor ==\nIn 1821, on the recommendation of Wellington, Brisbane was appointed Governor of New South Wales, a post he held until 1825. Brisbane took over the government on 1 December 1821, and at once proceeded to carry out some of the reforms recommended in the report of John Bigge. While Governor he tackled the many problems of a rapidly growing and expanding colony. He worked to improve the land grants system and to reform the currency. \nBrisbane's keen interest in science led him to accept the invitation to become the first President of the Philosophical Society of Australasia that later became the Royal Society of New South Wales.  He also set up the first agricultural training college in New South Wales and was the first patron of the New South Wales Agricultural Society. He conducted experiments in growing tobacco, cotton, coffee and New Zealand flax in the colony.\nHowever, Brisbane did not always receive loyal support from his administrative officers, and in particular from Frederick Goulburn, the colonial secretary. A reference to Brisbane's dispatch to Earl Bathurst dated 14 May 1825 shows that Bigge's recommendations had been carefully considered, and that many improvements had been made. Brisbane did not limit his attention to Bigge's report. \nEarly in April 1822 he discovered with some surprise the ease with which grants of land had hitherto been obtained. He immediately introduced a new system under which every grant had the stipulation that for every 100 acres (400,000 m2) granted the grantee would maintain free of expense to the crown one convict labourer. He also encouraged agriculture on government land, streamlined granting of tickets of leave and pardons and introduced, in 1823, a system of calling for supplies by tender. When Dr. Robert Wardell and William Wentworth brought out their paper the Australian in 1824, Brisbane tried the experiment of allowing full latitude of the freedom of the press.\nIn 1823 Brisbane sent Lieutenant John Oxley to find a new site for convicts who were repeat offenders. Oxley discovered a large river flowing into Moreton Bay. A year later, the first convicts arrived at Moreton Bay. Brisbane visited the settlement in December 1824. Oxley suggested that both the river and the settlement be named after Brisbane. The convict settlement was declared a town in 1834 and opened to free settlement in 1839.\nBrisbane was doing useful work, but he could not escape the effects of the constant faction fights which also plagued previous governors. Henry G. Douglass, the assistant-surgeon, was the centre of one of the bitter conflicts. Consequently, charges of various kinds against Brisbane were sent to England. The worst of these, that he had connived at sending female convicts to Emu Plains for immoral purposes, was investigated by William Stewart, the lieutenant-governor, John Stephen, assistant judge, and the Rev. William Cowper, senior assistant-chaplain, and found to be without the slightest foundation. \nBrisbane discovered that Goulburn, the colonial secretary, had been withholding documents from him and answering some without reference to the governor, and in 1824 reported his conduct to Lord Bathurst. In reply, Bathurst recalled both the governor and the colonial secretary in dispatches dated 29 December 1824.\n\n\n== Astronomer ==\n\nBrisbane was a keen astronomer throughout his career. He had an observatory built at his ancestral home in 1808. From this observatory he was able to contribute to the advances in navigation which took place over the next hundred years. He took telescopes, books and two astronomical assistants, Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker and James Dunlop to New South Wales with him. On arrival he had the first properly-equipped Australian observatory built at Parramatta while waiting for his predecessor, Governor Macquarie to complete his final arrangements. \nThe Parramatta observatory recorded stars of the southern hemisphere, the first detailed observations from the continent. Its major contribution was R\u00fcmker's rediscovery of Encke's comet in 1822. Brisbane left his equipment and books in the colony when he returned to Scotland. Remnants of this collection survive in the Sydney Observatory.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nBrisbane left Sydney in December 1825 and returned to Scotland. In 1826 he was made Colonel of the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot. He added the name of Makdougall before Brisbane, and settled down to the life of a country gentleman and took interest in science, his estate, and his regiment. He was elected president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1832) following the death of Sir Walter Scott, and in 1836 he was created a baronet. In the same year he was offered the command of the troops stationed in Canada and two years later the chief command in India, but declined both. He continued his astronomical researches, and did valuable work.\nHe was the first patron of science in Australia, and as such was eulogised by Sir John Herschel when he presented Brisbane with the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828. Oxford and Cambridge universities gave him the honorary degree of DCL, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Societies of both London and Edinburgh. He was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1814 and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1837.\nIn 1828 he won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He published The Brisbane Catalogue of 7,385 stars of the Southern Hemisphere in 1835. The Observatory was used until 1855.\n\nWhen Brisbane returned to Scotland he continued his studies and built a further observatory on his wife's estate, Makerstoun, near Kelso in the Borders. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and received its Keith Medal in 1848. In 1833 he acted as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He founded a gold medal for the encouragement of scientific research to be awarded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\nBrisbane died much respected and honoured on 27 January 1860 in Largs. His four children predeceased him. He is buried in the Brisbane Aisle Vault, which is in the small kirkyard next to the remains of Largs Old Kirk (known as Skelmorlie Aisle).\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe following features are named after Thomas Brisbane:\n\nBrisbane, the Australian state of Queensland's largest city and capital.\nBrisbane River in Queensland, Australia.\nBrisbane, a crater on the Moon.\nBrisbane Street, Greenock\nBrisbane Water, an estuary on the Central Coast of New South Wales.\nSir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium, located in Brisbane, Queensland.\nNoddsdale, the valley near Largs where his birthplace Brisbane House was situated, was renamed Brisbane Glen in his honour.\nIsabella Plains, a suburb in Canberra, named in honour of Isabella Brisbane, a daughter of Sir Thomas.\nBrisbane House Hotel in Largs, a town located by the sea in North Ayrshire, Scotland.\nThomas Makdougall Brisbane bridge in Largs\nMakdougall Brisbane prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Many other uses of Brisbane derive from the Australian city and hence are indirectly named after Thomas Brisbane.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistorical Records of Australia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n Baynes, T.

          "What an amazing experience and a must do in Brisbane. If you like astronomy, and want to know more about the universe, our our solar system and beyond then this is for you. The latest computer projection is utilised to project images onto the domed ceiling while you sit in a",
          "Great, informative place, with fantastic shows. We watched 'cosmic collisions' which my young children really enjoyed. Definately book online in advance, these shows sell out!",
          "What a wonderful planetarium. The shows offered were high quality and interesting followed by a star show by the staff. We learned a lot about the Southern sky (we're from the US so this was all new to us). It helped us later when we saw the stars on a clear light-free night.",
          "Arrived and Saturday night live show sold out. Pity as usually great show to see. Will be back again.",
          "I have taken visitors there many times and they have always enjoyed. Very interesting, informative and well presented. Great for families.",
          "I have always had a fascination with everything space, so having the opportunity to live so close to a planetarium is so great!! its good for fun on those days where you are not sure what to do and would like to explore your own universe.",
          "Full of history and detailed information, the Planetarium is a great, free activity for people of all ages. As a Brisbane local, it's definitely something I'd suggest people do if they have a weekend free and want something a little different :)",
          "The only thing disappointing about our visit to the planetarium was we only got to view one presentation. They offer two shows daily, but the early show often gets cancelled in lieu of a presentation for school groups. That happened on our visit day. Otherwise, the star",
          "Took my grandchildren on the school holidays, did't make a booking for the shows but was pleasantly surprised when I could go on the waiting list for the \"comic\" show. My grandchildren really enjoyed the presentation and so did I. Staff were very helpful. If you wanted to see a",
          "The Planetarium has four different children's shows. I took a 5 year old and an 8 year old to see \"Secret of the Cardboard Rocket\". The 5 year old was probably a bit young and restless. We all learned so much -especially me. The presentation was very engaging. I would highly",
          "Had driven up to Mt Coot-tha and had dinner, drove by the planetarium on a whim- and their saturday night show was about to start- $25 for an adult and teenager- great graphics, comfy seats and a reminder we are very, very small in this universe of ours! Made us want to buy a",
          "We booked the tickets by phone to guarantee our place, then purchased them before the show began. We went to a show with our grand-daughter aged 8 called Perfect Little Planet, which was a great introduction of space for her. The display in the planetarium is good,",
          "From the Astronauts suit on display to the many other displays of satellites and space items, and the various shows being offered, this is a great place to take the kids to show them the amazing things regarding space exploration.",
          "There is a lot to see and do here for no cost. There are meteorites, models of space vessels all things space. You could spend 30 minutes to 2 hours wondering around. There is also a 360 degree cinema with a large selection of space related movies. It's air conditioned. Baby",
          "The planetarium itself is quite basic with limited displays but they are a great introduction to astronomy. The shows are fantastic and kept my attention. You lie back and watch them on a huge dome. They were really well done and afterwards they showed a tour of the Brisbane",
          "What a great place for all ages & all types of people. If you are into planets, stars, astronauts or anything to do with the night sky, then you should definitely take a visit to the Planetarium. It's free to get in & have a look around. Or if you wish to watch a show that goes",
          "Dark Universe was a fascinating program. Easily understood by most ages and well worth the visit. Ticket prices are reasonable and the Saturday Night Live session is super fun and informative.",
          "We took our grandson here and was very impressed with the range of activities to do for young and old, we all had a great time",
          "Located in Toowong near the freeway entrance this is a good place to take your children and see the stars that are not visible nowadays- education and entertainment",
          "I would recommend this place as a great place to take kids around 8 plus. It is a real treat to sit back and enjoy the solar system in all it's glory projected onto the dome above. It feels as if you are part of the night sky and a must do. Adults will enjoy this attraction too.",
          "You can't go wrong taking visitors and or family to a show at the Planetarium. If possible, choose a show that offers live commentary by a specialist in the field... I promise you they have plenty of stories to keep the audience regaled and you are sure to be fascinated by the",
          "We enjoyed a film at the Planetarium after walking around the new section of the Botanical Gardens nearby which was created by American Museum of Natural History and featured impressive 3D effects. It was designed for adults but older teens would have liked it too. Not cheap",

          "Always good shows particularly Saturday night live. Good alternative to the standard cinema experience.",
          "The displays are mediocre at best, Australia has contribute a great deal to space research and the planetarium really does not reflect this with the written information boards or displays. The various films that are shown are good but not excellent.A little pricy for my liking.",
          "We visited the planetarium today with a 4 year ild and a 2 year old. We selected the preschool show Tygo goes to the moon. IT was perfect for this age group. 30 minutes long it held the attention of even the 2 year old who reclined in her chair and gazed at the story unfolding",
          "Great night at 'Saturday Night Live' show. Really enjoyed the guided tour, and we'l be back to view the other shows. The Husband says he needs a life-time membership! :-)",
          "The awesome shows at the planetarium are quit interesting and worth the small fee to see. Aside from some models and information about space it is otherwise not very interactive. The gift shop, though small, has some interesting gifts to purchase.",
          "I have been here a few time.And it has always been a delight for me..I plan on taking my granddaughter this school holidays ..She is into stares like me..The staff are great and well informed too and .very helpful",
          "Planetarium itself is fairly small with only a few things to look at, if making the trip it is probably best to pay and do one of the interactive shows. The shows are interesting and very informative.",
          "Loved visiting the planetarium however we went to visit it again only to find it closed so we had very disappointed children",
          "Stopped off for a visit had a walk around looking at the things on display and and watch a movie with was great and a star show on the dome was also very goad and informative",
          "We did a stopover enroute to Beaudesert. Our 5-year old daughter enjoyed the show. Exhibits were educational. If we had more time, we would explore the gardens as well.",
          "We visited the planetarium for we heard that there were interesting exhibits inside. It is not very big but it had many interesting facts about the cosmos. The show was good and took about 45 minutes. Well worth seeing.",
          "While watching the new moon & commentimg that it looked like a fingernail my hubby & I remembered our trips to the planetarium where we have learnt the more scientific ways to describe the moons phases! We wish we had a planetarium here in Cairns. Will go again next time we are",
          "Not somewhere I ever really planned to go but we had time to kill in the area so we stopped by and were glad we did. A few cool displays and some interesting stories and facts about space exploration will keep you entertained for half an hour or so. Then head into the gardens",
          "The planetarium makes for an interesting visit if you want to learn something new and do something out of the everyday. It is reasonably priced and the seats are comfortable in the auditorium where the presentations are made. The movies are interesting, as are the presentations",
          "The place is a small on at the exhibition area. Once you are in the auditorium is big and comfortable. We went in an special day, open house Brisbane, because the description of the visit was something like behind the scenes, and it was just a boring 45 min talk for the",

          "First trip there yesterday at the invitation of my grandson. He loves the place, has been many times & wants to go back again soon. I think they cater well for kids with several shows a week in the cosmic skydome, either as individual visitors or school groups. And at each show",
          "We have been here many times and my children just love it. The shows are great for many age groups and the gentleman that introduces them and talks about the night sky after the movie and points things out speaks wonderfully at an age appropriate level for the kids. We have all",
          "Didn't know what to expect with the movie, but it was just great! its in a dome, so you look up at the ceiling for the entire movie. Book ahead definitely. Our 3 young children, under 6, thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted to see it again, straight away. Allow about 20-30",
          "A must see if you are visiting Brisbane. A very visual educational experience provided with expert commentary. I managed to get in on a school session for teens called Pluto Horizon which was visually amazing. Those school sessions would be great for most adults too as I don't",
          "We spent part of a day in the Mount Coot-tha area at the end of June and the Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium was one of the stops we made while we were there. The Cosmic Skydome is great and the shows are excellent, the Solar System area and pictures from the Hubble Space",
          "Myself and my partner went to the planetarium today and we had a great time. The exhibit is free and very informative and interesting to read. We went to 2 of the shows which were both amazing when your sat in the dome it really feels like you are in the stars. The only negative",
          "Good for children's learning of our solar system. Excellent guides. The show was really good for both young and old.",
          "I love this place! The exhibit is free and so very interesting, great way to spend a few hours especially if it's raining. The kids will love the space suits,rockets and learning about stars and planets.There are a few shows running throughout the day which are just awesome, so",

          "On a rainy day and with some time free for us, we decided to visit the Mt Cootha Botanical Gardens. First stop off the rank was the Planetarium. Whilst I am still trying to figure out how a facility dedicated to astronomy relates to a garden. I enjoyed what I saw in the",
          "Went there with my kids and enjoyed it the show was awesome and I will go again. I am into Astrophotography and Astronomy and suggest anyone fascinated with the night sky to have a peek. The shows are just long enough to hold young kids attentions and are fun for young and old.",
          "We saw the \"Perfect Little Planet\" show in the star dome which was great for my 10ys old daughter - I enjoyed it too. They also showed a portion of \"Starlight\", an Australian production, which looked good too. There was another show titled \"Tyko to the Moon\" which is for",
          "The planetarium has been on our bucket list for ages so during recent school holidays took the almost 5 & 3 yr old along to see Tycho goes to the moon. Excellent age appropriate experience the 3 yr old started getting restless near the end but both have been out each night",
          "My husband is a keen enthusiast so had to visit the Planetarian. Peter the very friendly and knowledgable expert actually took us up too to see the telescopes. We enjoyed the educational displays around the walls and we also thoroughly enjoyed the Cosmic Collision experience",
          "Had a great time visiting this planetarium. Took my grandchildren. We attended a special showing for younger children. The commentary was age appropriate. The displays outside the theatre were well organised",
          "We did not get a lot of time to look around here at the planetarium which was a shame. We went in saw the movie and had to go. I would have loved to have been able to spend more time, looking at the displays and learning more about our universe.",

          "The kids will love it - including the big kids out there. My wife and I enjoyed a show at the planetarium as part of a Valentine's Day package put on by the restaurant at the gardens. Being Valentine's Day, that influenced the subject matter for the show - star-crossed lovers",
          "My friend and I went to a Saturday Night Live show for something different to do. It was an excellent night out. Reasonably priced with ample parking. I DO recommend booking as we were chastised for not doing so.",
          "The Planetarium is an efficient little spot, they pack a great deal of displays in information signage in a small area. The actual Planetarium is quiet and dark with the presentations given in such a soothing voice it may be difficult to stay awake but it's very interesting and",
          "Very educational. Good to learn about the universe, night sky and history of astronomy. Plenty of parking.",
          "We went in the morning to the planetarium hoping to watch something in the auditorium. We were very disappointed to learn that all the morning shows are for children and the adult ones are all in the afternoon. Having got there at 10am when it opens and the first adult show not",
          "I was quite looking forward to visiting but it was disappointing. It is very small, the displays are poor and the accompanying information is placed at a height which is obstructed by the angle in the display case for any average height adult. The building could do with some",
          "Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium is a fabulous mix of facts, fun and interesting shows about all things space. Whether it is the local night sky or an andventure into the great beyond there is something to suit all interest levels, whether you are three or 103. The expert staff",
          "We especially wanted to see one of the shows and so telephoned ahead to be sure of a place. It would be great if they could permit booking online (the lack of this service was surprising), but the staff were very friendly and helpful. The displays are modest but well done.",
          "Great little presentation. Not overly long, so no one should lose interest or get bored. We saw cosmic collisions, narrated by Robert Redfed. It was priced about right and would definitely recommend.",

          "Free entry to the public exhibit. Charge for the show in the Dome which was narrated in person by the local expert (he did know his stuff and presented it with confidence). Depending on what show you see it will either be a 'wonderous' experience or an 'okay' experience,",
          "What a great experience attending the show in the dome! We really are a tiny speck in the cosmic universe. Comfortable seating and really is a world class presentation. There is a lot of fascinating information available without attending a show, so still very worth doing even",
          "We had outing to the planetarium , as it sounded interesting and I love space related things. What a beautiful little place, great experience and exhibits, and the show was fascinating. We will be back to see some of the other shows. Loved it",

          "I've seen a few of the shows here. They're brilliant every time. I'm 21 and my partner 24, so by no means is this an exclusive family attraction. Science nerds and space lovers must visit. Not bad for a little date even, head up Mt. Cootha following a show for a sunset or star",
          "Been here many times and every show is worth the admission. Great place to visit for adults and children.",

          "Took our NZ cousins to the Mt Cootha botanical gardens while they were in town. We were surprised and impressed by the planetarium and how informative and entertaining it was. Well worth a look and not just for science or space geeks.",
          "We went to the Cosmic Collisions show and it was really worth it. Very well presented and informative. Comfortable seating and view of sky brilliant. The gift shop is also great with all sorts of interesting and fun stuff. Not just gimmicky junk. Well worth going. Book a place",

          "OK, as an amateur astronomer I am biased, however, having been to many planetaria around the world I have to say that this one is right up there with the best. The show was very interesting (moons), and the current live night sky segment, run by Duncan, was the best I have seen",
          "One of the best experiences in Brisbane. Great planetarium shows each followed by a live description of the night sky over Brisbane. There is an exhibition area to look at while waiting for a show to start with the highlights being the small models of every important spacecraft.",
          "I only looked at the exhibits in the display cases which were quite good. There are NASA ones, and other countries exhibits featuring the race to the moon. The information about the different planets was interesting for me. If you want to enter the theaters, you have to pay a",

          "The 45 minute shows are great for kids and adults alike and the gallery of astronomy related items is really good too. The fact that it's right next door to the Botanical Gardens means you could see a show and look around and then have a walk around the gardens and some lunch.",

        "wiki": "Brisbane ( (listen)) is the capital of and the most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of over 2.5 million, and the South East Queensland metropolitan region, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.6 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the historic European settlement and is situated inside a peninsula of the Brisbane River, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) from its mouth at Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges. It sprawls across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs)\u2014most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is \"Brisbanite\", whilst common nicknames include \"Brissy\", \"River City\" and \"Brisvegas\".One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the Aboriginal Turrbal and Jagera nations. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located\u2014which in turn takes its name from Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales at the time of the city's founding\u2014the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. The Moreton Bay penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 kilometres (17 mi) north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur.A diverse city with 32.2% of its metropolitan population being foreign born, Brisbane is classified as a global city, and ranks highly in ratings of liveable cities. Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city's built heritage. The city is noted for its cuisine brunches, outdoor dining, and rooftop bar scene. Brisbane was also the origin of the Anzac Day tradition through the works of Canon David John Garland. \nA transportation hub, Brisbane is served by a large suburban rail network, popular bus and ferry networks as well as Australia's third-busiest airport and seaport.\nBrisbane is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, which are home to numerous popular surf beaches, located immediately south and north of Brisbane respectively. Major landmarks and attractions include South Bank Parklands, the Queensland Cultural Centre (including the Queensland Museum, Queensland Art Gallery, Gallery of Modern Art, Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland), City Hall, the Story Bridge, the Howard Smith Wharves, ANZAC Square, St John's Cathedral, Fortitude Valley (including James Street and Chinatown), West End, the Teneriffe woolstores precinct, the Brisbane River and its Riverwalk network, the City Botanic Gardens, Roma Street Parkland, New Farm Park (including the Brisbane Powerhouse), the Kangaroo Point Cliffs and park, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the Mount Coot-tha Reserve (including Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens), the D'Aguilar Range and National Park, as well as Moreton Bay (including Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands, and coastal suburbs such as Shorncliffe, Wynnum and those on the Redcliffe Peninsula).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-19th century ===\nIndigenous Australians are believed to have lived in coastal South East Queensland for 22,000 years, with an estimated population between 6,000 and 10,000 individuals before white settlement. At this time, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Jagera people, including the Turrbal group, who knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning \"place shaped as a spike\". Archaeological evidence suggests frequent habitation around the Brisbane River, and notably at the site now known as Musgrave Park.Jagara (also known as Jagera, Yagara, and Yuggera) and Yugarabul (also known as Ugarapul and Yuggerabul) are Australian Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland.  There is some uncertainty over the status of Jagara as a language, dialect or perhaps a group or clan within the local government boundaries of Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. The languages of Greater Brisbane are related \u2013 there is uncertainty over which dialects belong to which language. The Yugarabul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Brisbane City Council, Ipswich City Council and the Scenic Rim Regional Council.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Moreton Bay area was initially explored on behalf of European colonisers by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named \"Red Cliff Point\" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay. In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.Oxley claimed, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km (12 mi) upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore. The party settled in Redcliffe on 13 September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km (17 mi) south, which offered a more reliable water supply. The newly selected Brisbane region, at the time, was plagued by mosquitos.After visiting the Redcliffe settlement, Sir Thomas Brisbane then travelled 45 km (28 mi) up the Brisbane River in December 1824. Governor Brisbane stayed overnight in a tent and often landed ashore, bestowing upon Brisbane City the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake. Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838 and the population grew strongly thereafter, with free settlers soon far outstripping the convict population. German missionaries settled at Zions Hill, Nundah as early as 1837, five years before Brisbane was officially declared a free settlement. The band consisted of ministers Christopher Eipper (1813\u20131894) and Carl Wilhelm Schmidt and lay missionaries Haussmann, Johann Gottried Wagner, Niquet, Hartenstein, Zillman, Franz, Rode, Doege and Schneider. They were allocated 260 hectares and set about establishing the mission, which became known as the German Station. Later in the 1860s many German immigrants from the Uckermark region in Prussia as well as other German regions settled in the Bethania- Beenleigh and Darling Downs areas. These immigrants were selected and assisted through immigration programs established by John Dunmore Lang and Johann Christian Heussler and were offered free passage, good wages, and selections of land.The penal settlement under the control of Captain Patrick Logan flourished with the numbers of convicts increasing dramatically from around 200 to over 1000 men. He created a substantial settlement of brick and stone buildings, complete with school and hospital. He formed additional outstations and made several important journeys of exploration. Logan is infamous for his extreme use of the cat o' nine tails on convicts. The maximum allowed limit of lashes was 50; however, Logan regularly applied sentences of 150 lashes.Free settlers entered the area over the following five years, and by the end of 1840, Robert Dixon began work on the first plan of Brisbane Town, in anticipation of future development. Queensland was separated from New South Wales by letters patent dated 6 June 1859, proclaimed by Sir George Ferguson Bowen on 10 December 1859, whereupon he became Queensland's first governor, with Brisbane chosen as its capital.In 1893, Brisbane was affected by the Black February flood, when the Brisbane River burst its banks on three occasions in February and again in June in the same year, with the city receiving more than year's rainfall during February 1893, leaving much of the city's population homeless.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nOver 20 small municipalities and shires were amalgamated in 1925 to form the City of Brisbane, governed by the Brisbane City Council. A significant year for Brisbane was 1930, with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the Shrine of Remembrance, in ANZAC Square, which has become Brisbane's main war memorial. These historic buildings, along with the Story Bridge which opened in 1940, are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city.\nDuring World War II, Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called MacArthur Central) was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to Hollandia in August 1944. MacArthur had previously rejected use of the University of Queensland complex as his headquarters, as the distinctive bends in the river at St Lucia could have aided enemy bombers. Also used as a headquarters by the American troops during World War II was the T & G Building. About one million US troops passed through Australia during the war, as the primary co-ordination point for the South West Pacific. In 1942, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.Postwar Brisbane had developed a \"big country town\" stigma, an image the city's politicians and marketers were very keen to remove. In the late 1950s, an anonymous poet known as The Brisbane Bard generated much attention on the city which helped shake this stigma. Despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The state government under Joh Bjelke-Petersen began a major program of change and urban renewal, beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs. Trams in Brisbane were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969, leaving Melbourne and one line in Adelaide as the last Australian state capitals to operate trams until Sydney begun operation of a new system in 1997.\n\nThe 1974 Brisbane flood was a major disaster which temporarily crippled the city. During this era, Brisbane grew and modernized, rapidly becoming a destination of interstate migration. Some of Brisbane's popular landmarks were lost to development in controversial circumstances, including the Bellevue Hotel in 1979 and Cloudland in 1982. Major public works included the Riverside Expressway, the Gateway Bridge, and later, the redevelopment of South Bank, starting with the Queensland Art Gallery.\nBetween 1968 and 1987, when Queensland was governed by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose government was characterised by strong social conservatism and the use of police force against demonstrators, and which ended with the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption, Brisbane developed a counterculture focussed on the University of Queensland, street marches and Brisbane punk rock music.\nBrisbane hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1988 World Exposition (known locally as World Expo 88). These events were accompanied by a scale of public expenditure, construction, and development not previously seen in the state of Queensland. Brisbane's population growth far exceeded the national average in the last two decades of the 20th century, with a high level of interstate migration from Victoria and New South Wales.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAfter three decades of record population growth, Brisbane was hit again by a major flood in January 2011. The Brisbane River did not reach the same height as the previous 1974 flood, but still caused extensive damage and disruption to the city.Brisbane also hosted major international events including the final Goodwill Games in 2001, the Rugby League World Cup Final in 2008 and again in 2017, as well as the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit.\nPopulation growth has continued to be among the highest of the Australian capital cities in the first two decades of the 21st century, and major infrastructure including the Howard Smith Wharves, Roma Street Parklands, Queens Wharf, the Brisbane Riverwalk, the Queen's Wharf casino and resort precinct, the Brisbane International Cruise Terminal, the Clem Jones, Airport Link, and Legacy Way road tunnels, and the Airport, Springfield, Redcliffe Peninsula and Cross River Rail railway lines have been completed or are under construction.\n\n\n== Geography and environment ==\n\nBrisbane is in the southeast corner of Queensland. The city is centred along the Brisbane River, and its eastern suburbs line the shores of Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea in the Pacific Ocean. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the Great Dividing Range, with the Taylor and D'Aguilar ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the Moreton Bay floodplain between the Gold and Sunshine coasts, approximately from Caboolture in the north to Beenleigh in the south, and across to Ipswich in the south west.\nThe Brisbane River is a wide tidal estuary and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are brackish and navigable. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at Moreton Bay in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the North Pine and South Pine rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the Pine River estuary at Bramble Bay, the Caboolture River further north, the Logan and Albert rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and tributaries of the Brisbane River including the Bremer River in the south-western suburbs, Breakfast Creek in the inner-north, Norman Creek in the inner-south, Oxley Creek in the south, Bulimba Creek in the inner south-east and Moggill Creek in the west. The city is on a low-lying floodplain, with the risk of flooding increased by the many suburban creeks which criss-cross the city.\nThe waters of Moreton Bay are sheltered from large swells by Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands, so whilst the bay can become rough in windy conditions, the waves at Moreton Bay beaches are generally not surfable. Unsheltered surf beaches lie on the eastern coasts of Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands islands and on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast to the north and south. The southern part of Moreton Bay also contains smaller islands such as St Helena Island, Peel Island, Coochiemudlo Island, Russell Island, Lamb Island and Macleay Island.\nThe city of Brisbane is hilly. The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the Herbert Taylor Range, such as the summit of Mount Coot-tha, reaching up to 300 m (980 ft) and the smaller Enoggera Hill. The D'Aguilar National Park, encompassing the D'Aguilar Range, bounds the north-west of Brisbane's built-up area, and contains the taller peaks of Mount Nebo, Camp Mountain, Mount Pleasant, Mount Glorious, Mount Samson and Mount Mee. Other prominent rises in Brisbane are Mount Gravatt and nearby Toohey Mountain. Mount Petrie at 170 m (560 ft) and the lower rises of Highgate Hill, Mount Ommaney, Stephens Mountain, and Whites Hill are dotted across the city.\nMuch of the rock upon which Brisbane is located is the characteristic Brisbane tuff, a form of welded ignimbrite, which is most prominently found at the Kangaroo Point Cliffs at Kangaroo Point and the New Farm Cliffs on the Petrie Bight reach of the Brisbane River. The stone was used in the construction of historical buildings such as the Commissariat Store and Cathedral of St Stephen, and the roadside kerbs in inner areas of Brisbane are still manufactured of Brisbane tuff.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\n\nBrisbane is located within the South East Queensland biogeographic region, and is home to numerous Eucalyptus varieties. Trees considered iconic to Brisbane include the Moreton Bay fig, a very large evergreen banyan with imposing buttress roots named for the region which are often lit with decorative lights in the inner city, as well as the jacaranda, a subtropical tree native to South America which line avenues and parks throughout Brisbane and bloom with purple flowers during October, referred to locally as 'jacaranda season'. Other trees common to the metropolitan area include Moreton Bay chestnut, broad-leaved paperbark, poinciana, weeping lilli pilli and Bangalow palm. Some of the banks of the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay are home to mangrove wetlands.\nBrisbane is home to numerous bird species, with common species including rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, galahs, Australian white ibises, Australian brushturkeys, Torresian crows, Australian magpies and noisy miners. Common reptiles include common garden skinks, Australian water dragons, bearded dragons and blue-tongued lizards. Common ringtail possums and flying foxes are common in parks and yards throughout the city, as are common crow butterflies, blue triangle butterflies, golden orb-weaver spiders and St Andrew's Cross spiders. The Brisbane River is home to many fish species including yellowfin bream, flathead, Australasian snapper, and bull sharks. The waters of Moreton Bay are home to dugongs, humpback whales, dolphins, mud crabs, soldier crabs, Moreton Bay bugs and numerous shellfish species.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBrisbane has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot, wet summers and moderately dry, moderately warm winters. Brisbane experiences an annual mean minimum of 16.6 \u00b0C (62 \u00b0F) and mean maximum of 26.6 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F), making it Australia's second-hottest capital city after Darwin. Seasonality is not pronounced, and average maximum temperatures of above 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) persist from October through to April.\nDue to its proximity to the Coral Sea and a warm ocean current, Brisbane's overall temperature variability is somewhat less than most Australian capitals. Summers are long, hot, and wet, but temperatures only occasionally reach 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) or more. Eighty percent of summer days record a maximum temperature of 27 to 33 \u00b0C (81 to 91 \u00b0F). Winters are short and warm, with average maximums of about 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F); maximum temperatures below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) are rare.\nThe city's highest recorded temperature was 43.2 \u00b0C (109.8 \u00b0F) on Australia Day 1940 at the Brisbane Regional Office, with the highest temperature at the current station being 41.7 \u00b0C (107.1 \u00b0F) on 22 February 2004; but temperatures above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) are uncommon. On 19 July 2007, Brisbane's temperature fell below the freezing point for the first time since records began, registering \u22120.1 \u00b0C (31.8 \u00b0F) at the airport station. The city station has never dropped below 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F), with the average coldest night during winter being around 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F), however locations in the west of the metropolitan area such as Ipswich have dropped as low as \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) with heavy ground frost.In 2009, the current Brisbane weather station recorded its hottest winter day at 35.4 \u00b0C (95.7 \u00b0F) on 24 August; however, on the penultimate day of winter, the Brisbane Regional Office station recorded a temperature of 38.3 \u00b0C (100.9 \u00b0F) on 22 September 1943. The average July day however is around 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) with sunny skies and low humidity, occasionally as high as 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F), whilst maximum temperatures below 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) are uncommon and usually associated with brief periods of cloud and winter rain. The highest minimum temperature ever recorded in Brisbane was 28.0 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F) on 29 January 1940 and again on 21 January 2017, whilst the lowest maximum temperature was 10.2 \u00b0C (50.4 \u00b0F) on 12 August 1954.Annual precipiation is ample. From November to March, thunderstorms are common over Brisbane, with the more severe events accompanied by large damaging hail stones, torrential rain and destructive winds. On an annual basis, Brisbane averages 124 clear days. Dewpoints in the summer average at around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F); the apparent temperature exceeds 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on almost all summer days. Brisbane's wettest day occurred on 21 January 1887, when 465 millimetres (18.3 in) of rain fell on the city, the highest maximum daily rainfall of Australia's capital cities. The wettest month on record was February 1893, when 1,025.9 millimetres (40.39 in) of rain fell, although in the last 30 years the record monthly rainfall has been a much lower 479.8 millimetres (18.89 in) from December 2010. Very occasionally a whole month will pass with no recorded rainfall, the last time this happened was August 1991. The city has suffered three major floods since its founding, in February 1893, January 1974 (partially a result of Cyclone Wanda), and January 2011 (partially a result of Cyclone Tasha).\nBrisbane is within the southern reaches of the tropical cyclone risk zone. Full strength tropical cyclones rarely affect Brisbane, but they do occasionally. The biggest risk is ex tropical cyclones which can cause destructive winds and flooding rains.The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from 21.0 \u00b0C (69.8 \u00b0F) in July to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in February.\n\n\n== Urban structure ==\n\nThe Brisbane central business district (CBD, colloquially referred to as 'the city') lies in a curve of the Brisbane river. The CBD covers 2.2 km2 (0.8 sq mi) and is walkable. Most central streets are named after members of the House of Hanover. Queen Street (named in honour of Queen Victoria) is Brisbane's traditional main street and contains its largest pedestrian mall, the Queen Street Mall. Streets named after female members (Adelaide, Alice, Ann, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Mary) run parallel to Queen Street and perpendicular to streets named after male members (Albert, Edward, George, and William).\nThe CBD's squares include King George Square, Post Office Square and ANZAC Square (home to the city's central war memorial).\nBrisbane's metropolitan area is broadly and colloquially divided into the 'northside' and the 'southside', with the dividing line being the Brisbane River, as crossing one of the fifteen bridges across the river is required to travel to the opposite side by land transport. This results in many areas which are south of the CBD being classified as located in the 'northside', and vice versa, as a result of the river's winding trajectory. In addition to being classified as located on the 'northside' or 'southside' there are further broad and colloquial regions such as the 'westside' for some areas to the southwest of the CBD and the 'bayside' for areas located on the coast of Moreton Bay.\nGreater Brisbane had a density of 148 inhabitants per square kilometre (380/sq mi) in 2016. Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of apartment developments, including mid-rise and high rise buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in separate houses, 12.6% lived in apartments, and 10% lived in townhouses, terrace houses, or semidetached houses.\n\n\n=== Parklands ===\n\nBrisbane's major parklands include the riverside City Botanic Gardens at Gardens Point, Roma Street Parkland, the 27-hectare Victoria Park at Spring Hill and Herston, South Bank Parklands along the river at South Bank, the Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Mount Coot-tha and the riverside New Farm Park at New Farm.\nThere are many national parks surrounding the Brisbane metropolitan area. The D'Aguilar National Park is a major national park along the northwest of the metropolitan area in the D'Aguilar Range. The Glass House Mountains National Park is located to the north of the metropolitan area in the Glass House Mountains and provides green space between the Brisbane metropolitan area and the Sunshine Coast. The Tamborine National Park at Tamborine Mountain is located in the Gold Coast hinterland to the south of the metropolitan area.\nThe eastern metropolitan area is built along the Moreton Bay Marine Park, encompassing Moreton Bay. Significant areas of Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands also covered by the Moreton Island National Park, Naree Budjong Djara National Park and the Bribie Island National Park respectively. The Boondall Wetlands in the suburb of Boondall include 1100 hectares of wetlands which are home to mangroves and shorebirds as well as walking tracks.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBrisbane has retained many heritage buildings, some of which date back to the 1820s, including The Old Windmill in Wickham Park, built by convict labour in 1824, which is the oldest surviving building in Brisbane, and the Commissariat Store on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used as a grainhouse, and is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane and contains a museum. Other 19th and early 20th-century buildings of architectural significance include the Treasury Building, City Hall, Customs House and the Land Administration Building.\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as Queenslander architecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large verandahs, gabled corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few terrace houses being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature Queenslander-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\nBrisbane is home to several of Australia's tallest buildings and it is ranked among world cities with the most skyscrapers. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. Brisbane's tallest building is currently Brisbane Skytower, which has a height of 270 metres.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBrisbane's Greater Capital City Statistical Area includes the Local Government Areas of City of Brisbane, City of Ipswich, Moreton Bay Region, Logan City and Redland City, as well as parts of Lockyer Valley Region, Scenic Rim Region and Somerset Region, which form a continuous metropolitan area. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the population of Greater Brisbane is 2,514,184 as of June 2019, making it the third largest city in Australia.\n\n\n=== Ancestry and immigration ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:\n\nThe 2016 census showed that 32.2% of Brisbane's inhabitants were born overseas and 50.9% of inhabitants had at least one parent born overseas. Brisbane has the 26th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. Of inhabitants born outside of Australia, the four most prevalent countries of birth were New Zealand, England, Mainland China, and India. Brisbane has the largest New Zealand and Taiwanese-born populations of any city in Australia.The areas of Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Stretton, Robertson, Calamvale, Macgregor, Eight Mile Plains, Runcorn and Rochedale, are home to a large proportion of Brisbane's Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong-born population, with Chinese being the most commonly-reported ancestry in each of these areas. The Vietnamese-born are the largest immigrant group in Inala, Darra, Durack, Willawong, Richlands and Doolandella. The Indian-born are the largest immigrant group in Chermside.2.4% of the population, or 54,158 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nAt the 2016 census, 78% of inhabitants spoke only English at home, with the next most common languages being Mandarin (2.4%), Vietnamese (1.0%), Cantonese (0.9%), Spanish (0.7%), Hindi (0.6%), Samoan (0.6%), Korean (0.6%) and Punjabi (0.6%).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly cited religious affiliations was 'No religion' (30.6%).Brisbane's most popular religion at the 2016 census was Christianity, and the most popular denomonations were Catholicism (21.5%) and Anglicanism (13.3%). Other Christian denominations including Uniting Church, Baptists, Pentecostalism, Lutheranism and Eastern Orthodox made up 18.8% of the population. All Christian demoninations totalled 53.6% of the population. Brisbane's CBD is home to two cathedrals \u2013 St John's (Anglican) and St Stephen's (Catholic).\nThe most popular non-Christian religions at the 2016 census were Buddhist (2%), Muslim (1.5%) and Hindu (1.5%).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCategorised as a global city, Brisbane is among Asia-Pacific cities with largest GDPs and is one of the major business hubs in Australia, with strengths in mining, banking, insurance, transportation, information technology, real estate and food.Some of the largest companies headquartered in Brisbane, all among Australia's largest, include Suncorp Group, Virgin Australia, Aurizon, Bank of Queensland, Flight Centre, CUA, Sunsuper, QSuper, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, Star Entertainment Group, ALS, TechnologyOne, NEXTDC, Super Retail Group, New Hope Coal, Jumbo Interactive, National Storage, Collins Foods and Boeing Australia. Most major Australian companies, as well as numerous international companies, have contact offices in Brisbane.\nBrisbane throughout its history has been one of Australia's most important seaport cities. The Port of Brisbane located at the Brisbane River's mouth on Moreton Bay and on the adjacent Fisherman's Island, created by means of land reclamation.

      "name": "New Farm Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "New Farm Park is a heritage-listed riverfront public park at 137 Sydney Street, New Farm, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Albert Herbert Foster and built from 1914 to 1950 by Gladwin Legge & Co. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.The park covers 15 hectares (37 acres) and is at the southeastern end of the New Farm peninsula on a bend in the Brisbane River. The Powerhouse arts centre is at the eastern end of the park. The park includes the New Farm Park ferry wharf and links to the Brisbane Riverwalk from Newstead to Toowong. It is one of Brisbane's most popular parklands and tourist attractions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNew Farm Park, created in 1914, currently covers 15.0076 hectares (37.085 acres) of land, and is bounded by Brunswick Street and Sydney Street, New Farm. It adjoins the Brisbane Powerhouse arts precinct and the Brisbane River.Prior to European settlement, the New Farm area was covered with bush and dotted with shallow lagoons. It supported a variety of wildlife and proved a bountiful resource to local Aborigines. The area was called Binkin-ba meaning place of the land tortoise.Following the founding of the Moreton Bay convict settlement on the Brisbane River, the land on which the park now stands was initially a farm. A racecourse was built on the site in 1846, which operated until 1913, when the land for the park was acquired by the Brisbane City Council. The Queensland Governor Hamilton Goold-Adams conducted the official opening of the park, which was delayed until July 1919 because of World War I.After a penal settlement was founded in 1825 at the location of the current Brisbane central business district, food was grown on cleared land in South Brisbane and the present City Botanical Gardens. In 1827 Captain Patrick Logan ordered the clearing of a new farm between the present day Merthyr Road and the river; drainage canals were dug, and convict labourers grew maize, potatoes, pumpkin, and corn. The convicts were marched to work each day from their main barracks in town, following a track on high ground that later became Moray Street. Due to the decline of the penal settlement following changes in British policy, free settlement began in Brisbane in 1842. A farmer named Prendegast appears to have planted maize at the new farm in 1842, although he was only leasing the land.Speculators in 1844 purchased the new farm's lowlands, and tenant farming followed, with dairying and small crops. Early resident Richard Jones acquired 93 acres (38 ha) in 1847, and called it \"New Farm\". Later Jones would become the first Brisbane person to be a Member in the New South Wales Legislative Council (prior to the separation of Queensland in 1859).In 1846 the Moreton Bay Jockey Club moved its annual race from Coopers Plains to land at New Farm owned by Thomas Adams. This land included Eastern Suburban Allotments 22, 28, 29 and 30, located at the south-eastern corner of the New Farm peninsula. The first (members only) meeting was held in May 1846, and public attendance began at the 1848 three-day race meeting. By 1849 the \"Brisbane Races\" were being held over the Christmas-New Year's period. The race meetings moved to Eagle Farm in 1861.Opinions vary as to the exact location of the racetrack itself. During the 1880s the land once owned by Thomas Adams was marketed for subdivision as the \"Old Racecourse Estate\", but allotments 28 to 30 included both the site of New Farm Park, as well as the land to the north of the small creek that formed the park's north-eastern boundary. In 1895, Merthyr Road was known as \"Old Racecourse Road\", and in 1913 the annual report of Henry Moore referred to the \"old racecourse paddock\" that was to become \"New Farm Park\". A 1925 aerial photo (John Oxley Library) appears to show the remains of the track on the site of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Refinery and the site of the Powerhouse, intersected by Lamington Street near the river.As horse racing disappeared from the area, suburban Brisbane was growing. The Municipality of Brisbane was formed in 1859, and the small farms of New Farm gave way in the 1870s to the residences of Brisbane's elite. Sir Samuel Griffith purchased 80 acres (32 ha) bounded by Sydney Street and Moray Street in 1870, and built his residence \"Merthyr\" in 1881 (demolished 1963).Low-density residential development was also occurring in James Street, Brunswick Street, and Bowen Terrace by 1879. In 1884, suburban development was mainly contained within the Moray Street, Merthyr Road, and James Street area. Many estates were subdivided during the 1880s speculative boom, but they were not necessarily built on. This included the old racecourse lands, which had been resumed by the Australian Bank of Commerce. They were marketed as the \"Russell Association Lands\" in 1887, and the remaining subdivisions were offered for sale as the \"Old Racecourse Estate\" in 1888-89. The Colonial Sugar Refinery was built on part of this land in 1893.\n\nHorse-drawn trams had extended their run along Brunswick Street to Langshaw Street by December 1885, the electrification of trams occurred after 1895, and the trams reached New Farm Park in 1926. Portions of New Farm's swamps were drained between 1884 and 1887, and open stone drains were built on the eastern side of the peninsula, being diverted along Merthyr Road to the river. The City of Brisbane absorbed the Booroodabin Shire in 1903, and finished the job of draining the area between 1903 and 1909.In 1884 Nehemiah Bartley wrote a letter to the Brisbane Courier on the need for a recreation reserve for New Farm's growing population, but negotiations for a park at New Farm did not begin until 1911. By 1912, about 37 acres (15 ha) 1 rood 8 perches (1,200 m2) of the Old Racecourse Estate remained unsold, the land lying to the south west of the small creek that entered the river at Norris Point. In June 1913 the Australian Bank of Commerce accepted the City's offer of \u00a325,800 for the land.The Brisbane City Council had been seeking control of the parks within its area to replace the previous system where a board of trustees was established to administer each park; these boards were reported to the Queensland Governor and not within the Council's control). Between 1887 and 1913 the Council gained full control of Wickham Park, Observatory Park, Hardgrave Park (Petrie Terrace), Babbage Park (Musgrave Road, Red Hill), Albert Park, Alexandra Park (now part of the Brisbane Showgrounds between Alexandria Street and Exhibition Street) and Victoria Park. The International Town Planning movement that existed at the time also helped to put city planning and beautification programmes on the city's agenda. Between 1913 and 1925, Bowen Park, New Farm Park, Raymond Park, Newstead Park, Perry Park, Centenary Park and Teneriffe Park were created.In his Annual Report for 1914, City Parks Superintendent Henry Moore noted that work had begun at New Farm Park on the 18 May 1914. According to Moore, a main drive, over 1,000 yards (910 m) in length and varying from 33 to 60 feet (10 to 18 m) wide, had been formed and prepared for gravelling, as had 950 yards (870 m) of pedestrian walks, at 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. The drive and walks were later laid with white Nundah gravel. Two lagoons, one with 2 islands and one with three islands, had been dug to a depth of 2 feet 6 inches (0.76 m), with 800 cubic yards (610 m3) of earth being removed and used to fill in an offset from the river that extended 200 yards (180 m) into the park. Two acres (0.81 ha) had been trenched throughout to a depth from 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) for an ornamental flower garden, and 14 circular beds from 50\u201360 feet (15\u201318 m) in diameter had been trenched to 2 feet (0.61 m) deep, ready to plant. 386 feet (118 m) of earthenware pipes had been laid to drain the lower lagoon into an offset from the river, and 500 holes for trees, plants, shrubs, had been prepared. 650 trees, plants, shrubs had been planted, and 3 acres (1.2 ha) of low-lying and swampy ground filled to a depth of 18 inches (460 mm) and grassed. Five and a half acres of undulating ground had been graded in readiness for rolling out a sports ground. Over 100 jacarandas had been planted around the drive, and poincianas had been planted in a continuous line from Sydney Street along Brunswick Street to the river. Flame trees were to have been planted behind the jacarandas, for a colour contrast, but these do not seem to have eventuated.\n\nPoinsettias had been planted in three circular beds, and bougainvilleas had been planted on both sides of a 160-yard walk, which may have been the path seen running east\u2013west across the centre of the park within the jacaranda drive in a 1925 aerial photograph. 100 palms and been planted, most transplanted from other parks. The main clusters of these palms lie to the south of the kiosk site; near the Powerhouse; along Brunswick Street between the poincianas; and either side of the two original pedestrian entrances from Brunswick Street, one opposite Elystan Street, and the other opposite Oxlade Drive. A double row of palms was also planted to the southeast of the original vehicle entrance for the drive, halfway between Sydney Street and Elystan Street, and which is currently closed to vehicles. The concrete stairway near the river was probably built around this time.Negotiations occurred in September 1914 with Mr and Mrs Pemberthy, who agreed to closure of Russell Street (now Alford) between Sydney Street and Dixon Street, and inclusion of this land in the park, on the condition that an entrance was formed at the end of Dixon Street.In 1915 a kiosk and bandstand were constructed in the park. Albert Herbert Foster, who became City Architect in 1913, designed both. Built in the Federation Queen Anne style, of timber with a Marseilles terracotta-tiled, bell-cast hip roof, the kiosk included accommodation for a lessee. The tender price of \u00a3598, from Tealby and Leitch, was accepted in September 1915, with the contract to be carried out within 10 weeks. Located between the tennis courts and croquet lawns, it addressed the circular drive and the central pleasure gardens. It was part of the formal park work began by the Brisbane City Council in 1914. Other facilities included a croquet lawn, picnic areas, cricket wickets, tennis courts and football grounds.The bandstand in the shape of a rotunda was also built in the Federation Queen Anne style. In July 1915 the \u00a3359 tender of Legge, Gladwin and Co was accepted, construction to take 6 weeks. Until the kiosk burnt down in 2000, it was one half of the last surviving kiosk-bandstand related group in Queensland. A kiosk and bandstand were built in Albert Park in 1911, a bandstand at Bowen Park (1914), and kiosks were built in the City Botanic Gardens, Moora Park (Sandgate) and Mount Coot-tha Lookout.In 1916 two concrete cricket wickets and 2 football grounds were completed at the north-western side of New Farm Park, and a croquet site was selected in the northeast. The croquet lawns were to form a break in the belt of trees on the park's north-eastern boundary, and until recently hedges always screened the lawns. Seven tennis courts were completed in 1917. However, World War I delayed an official opening for the park. At the opening of 20 July 1919, conducted by Governor Gould-Adams, Mayor Charles Buchanan noted that the park had been created because the city was deficient in \"lungs\". 800 rose bushes had been planted, as well as fig trees and Chinese elms along the northern boundary and the river. Some figs were also planted around the drive, mainly on its southern side.\n\nIn 1920 Edward, Prince of Wales, visited the park, and the Bougainvillea Avenue was renamed the \"Prince's Walk\". In August 1922 two war trophies were added to the park: a 5.9\" German Howitzer, captured by the 26th Battalion east of Amiens in 1918, and a Albatross aircraft, one of the many German aircraft surrendered to Britain at the end of the war. The Howitzer was mounted in the south-western corner of the park, between the concrete steps and the powerhouse, until its removal to the Crosby nursery in 1955 due the deterioration of its wheels. The Albatross was kept in a shelter nearby, and was removed in 1931. The shelter appears to have still existed in 1955.\n\nThe small creek that formed the park's original north-eastern boundary was filled in over time. In 1917 a Brisbane City Council minute called for it to be filled as far as the drain from the kiosk. The creek was still present on a 1921 map, but in January 1922 a Brisbane City Council minute noted that the watercourse on the park's northern boundary had been reclaimed, and that a new boundary fence was required due to the addition of CSR land to the park. In September 1921 the CSR Refinery planned to extend Lamington Street to the river, which would cut off part of New Farm Park, but the company offered allotments in Richardson Street and Cowley Street, where the playground is today, as compensation. When the Brisbane Tramway Powerhouse (decommissioned in 1971) was built in 1927-1928 straddling the site of the creek, it occupied some undeveloped parkland, and the present boundary of New Farm Park was thus set by 1927. To screen the Powerhouse, some trees were planted in the 1930s, but they have since been removed.\n\nIn 1935 the main drive was sealed with bitumen to reduce the dust problem, but a shelter for a visitor's book that was proposed the same year did not eventuate. In 1938 it was decided to create a proper cricket oval, with land filling to the level of Sydney Street, although this would only contain one football field. Two dressing sheds were built near the oval in 1938, and basketball courts were constructed 1938-1939, around the tennis courts that existed in the northern corner of the park- currently the library's carpark. In 1940 it was proposed to remove the bougainvillea hedge (visible in a 1937 aerial photo) from around the rose gardens, and to plant more jacarandas around the drive. There were supposedly 20,000 rose bushes in the park by 1940, according to the Queensland Government Tourist Bureau. The old rose bed design of Moore's can be clearly seen in a 1937 aerial photograph, but by 1946 this design was a ghost of its former self.Harry Oakman (1906-2002) conducted the first major redesign of the park from 1948 onwards, with a new rose garden layout being developed by 1953. Oakman had been Head Gardener, Department of Parks, for Newcastle City Council from 1940 to 1946, and was Manager of Parks and Gardens for the Brisbane City Council from 1946 to 1963. He later worked in Canberra, and wrote seven books on tropical and sub-tropical gardening.Oakman added new pedestrian paths in a loop inside the main drive, lookouts over the rose gardens, and planted new trees and shrubs, while maintaining most of the original tree plantings. A rose pergola was built in 1954, between the Oxlade Drive entrance and the bandstand, a children's playground was constructed in 1955 (later upgraded in 1962 and 1987). A new vehicle entrance was formed opposite Oxlade Drive in 1958-59. A new croquet clubhouse appears to have been built between 1952 and 1955, along with new toilets. A shed was also constructed south of the kiosk by 1951. A memorial drinking fountain honouring Mrs Henry Robertson, founder of Junior Red Cross, was built in 1948. It was later damaged and was removed, being replaced in 1968 at Mrs Robertson's request.However, Oakman's main triumph was his redesign of the rose beds. He believed that the roses should be organised by variety and colour, so that the public could be educated on the subject. In 1953 Henry Moore criticized Oakman's approach, but Oakman responded that the \"loss\" of roses that Moore was concerned about was simply an ongoing process of replacing old bushes with new plantings, better organised. Oakman also noted that 30-odd years of incompetent management had led Brisbane's parks to their current state of \"dereliction\". In October 1947 Oakman had been critical of the Brisbane City Council's practice of cutting roses to supply council offices, pointing out that 5656 dozen blooms had been appropriated over the previous year.\n\nA 1950 planting list included 2,500 rose plants, and by September 1953 a total stock of 5,325 bushes is listed in Brisbane City Council reports. This figure increased to 10,227 by 1957. Some Brisbane City Council sources claim that 11,000 bushes of 300 varieties were planted in 1962, although another Brisbane City Council source claims that this was the total stock at the time. An article in the Telegraph, 6 March 1965, claimed that there were 40,000 roses bushes in New Farm Park, which made it one of Australia's top three rose gardens. After the 1974 flood covered the rose beds in up to 5 centimetres (2.0 in) of toxic silt, 4,000 new rose bushes were ordered in 1974, and 3,000 more in 1975.\n\nA library was also built in the Park in 1975, despite local opposition to the loss of open space. A report by the Queensland Conservation Council released that year claimed that Brisbane's parks were, in general, often flat, lacking in trees and natural water features, and had too much emphasis on built-recreation facilities. The report argued that too many buildings, sports clubs, car parks, and roads all defeated the purpose of parks as open spaces.In 1969 a new sports clubhouse was built, and in 1979 a clock tower and time capsule, for Rotary International's 75th anniversary, was installed near the Oxlade Drive vehicle entrance. In 1984, a light German field gun was removed from the playground to go to the 2/14 Light Horse Regiment's museum. Captured by the Light Horse in Palestine in World War I, the gun had been sited by the Sandgate pier from 1923 onwards. At some point it had come to rest in New Farm Park.A 1991 study by R.J. Dobbs (Brisbane City Council parks management officer) found that the most popular areas of the park were the playground, barbeques, oval and bandstand. The main usage groups in 1991, according to Dobbs, included mothers and children, the handicapped and elderly, joggers and exercisers, tourists, picnic groups, wedding parties, social functions, and sports groups.\n\nSince a 1991 concept plan was developed for the park, jacarandas have been planted around the oval, a rainforest walk and a half basketball court has been established behind the library, and more picnic tables and barbeques have been added near the river. A path has been built between the kiosk site and the playground, running between the croquet lawns and the drive; the park has been linked to the Brisbane Powerhouse arts precinct, the Oxlade Drive entry has been upgraded, and a new pedestrian entry has been created at the corner of Sydney Street and Brunswick Street. Interpretive history signs have also been added at places in the park. Two tennis courts and a shelter were built on one half of the croquet lawns after 2001. A new New Farm ferry terminal was built, and in 2004 controversy has surrounded plans to build a new, larger kiosk to replace the 1915 kiosk destroyed in 2000.Features that have been lost over time include the bougainvillaea planted around the rose gardens (gone between 1940-1946); the two lagoons, and the east\u2013west pedestrian path through the centre of the park (gone by 1937); the tennis courts and basketball courts lost when the library was built in 1975; two old dressing sheds near the oval; sightboards at the north-east and south-west sides of the oval; an iron gateway on the south-eastern side of the oval; two old toilets between the Dixon Street entrance and the croquet lawns, and the 1954 rose pergola. An arbour that replaced the latter has also been removed since 2001. The 5.9\" memorial gun, the Albatross aircraft and its shelter, and a caretaker's cottage that once stood on the north-east boundary, north-west of the gardeners' depot, have also departed. In addition, the Oakman-era oval pathway inside the jacaranda drive, marked by the surviving mature poincianas, and most of Oakman's 1948-1953 rose gardens design, which was laid out within the circuit of the jacaranda drive, has disappeared. There was also a shelter just inside the loop road, on its northern side. The part of the surviving rose gardens that most closely resembles Oakman's original design is the large spiral near the bandstand. The original vehicle entrance is currently blocked to cars. In 2000, a four-month trial by the Brisbane City Council of an Aboriginal homeless shelter near the playground was ended by the Queensland Government. Dog toilets have also come and gone recently.Current park use includes both active and passive use. Active use ranges from sports use, such as soccer, football, croquet, tennis, basketball and boules, to social events and festivals, playground use, weddings, and cycling and jogging. More passive uses include picnics, strolls through the gardens, listening to brass bands every second Sunday, and tourists visiting to witness the jacarandas bloom.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe basic Edwardian layout of the park, designed by Henry Moore, remains largely intact today, along with remnants from the late 1940s/early 1950s garden redesign undertaken by Harry Oakman. Various structures and rose gardens have also come and gone, but many of the earlier tree plantings remain.New Farm Park's 15.0076 hectares (37.085 acres) currently contains a wide variety of trees, both mature and recent plantings, including jacarandas, poincianas, figs, palms, and coral trees. The central lawn within the jacaranda drive contains the remnants of the post-1948 rose garden arrangements, and an area of rainforest has been planted behind the library. In the shade of the trees near the kiosk site is an understorey of tropical plants, a character of park planting that is a distinct aspect of Brisbane's historic parks and large gardens.\n\nVehicle access occurs at the Oxlade Drive entrance, and the Library carpark. The main pedestrian entrances are at Dixon Street, the corner of Sydney Street and Brunswick Street, the old vehicle entrance on Brunswick Street between Sydney Street and Elystan Street, a path opposite Elystan Street, and a path running from the site of the old ferry terminal at the end of Brunswick Street. The jacaranda drive still follows its original course, and two of the original footpath routes within the drive still exist, radiating out from near the Oxlade Drive vehicle entrance. A new path runs between the kiosk site and the playground, and another new path links New Farm Park to the Brisbane Powerhouse.Facilities include a sports oval, a playground surrounded by mature banyan trees, picnic and barbeque areas near the river, a croquet lawn and two tennis courts, a library, a half basketball court, and a canoe and boat ramp on the river.Other structures include three toilets, three small shade shelters near the oval, a post-World War II shed south of the kiosk site, a croquet clubroom, small shelters around the croquet lawn, a tennis court shelter, soccer clubroom, gardener's depot, bandstand, shelters in the playground, a large Marquee south of the kiosk site, interpretative history signs, and a concrete stairway near the river (1915). Sculptures have also been commissioned for the park, and the Sandakan Memorial has been built recently. A new ferry terminal has also been built adjacent to the park.\n\nThe main features of historical interest from the 1914 to 1939 period include the remaining half of the croquet lawn, the concrete stairway near the river, the sports oval near Sydney Street, the jacaranda drive, and the two remaining paved paths within the drive loop. The Federation Queen Anne style bandstand, with tiled bell-cast hip roof, is of particular interest.Post World War II features of interest include the remnants of Oakman's rose gardens design, the rectangular, hip-roofed masonry croquet clubhouse, and the post-war shed with tiled roof, which lies to the south of the kiosk site. This shed was an open picnic shelter until recently. The soccer clubroom by the sports oval also has an interesting mosaic mural on its northern side.Besides the mature jacarandas and fig trees around the loop drive, other mature tree plantings of note include the various lines of palms, the weeping figs near the river, the banyan figs incorporated in the playground, the Queensland bottle trees shading the Brunswick Street barbeque area, poincianas along Brunswick Street and elsewhere, and remnants of Oakman's massed plantings of franpanis and bauhinias to form groves in a \"wild woodland\" manner.\n\n\n== Events ==\nFor a number of years the park was the finish line for both the short and long races in the Bridge to Brisbane. The park is also the location for the Queensland Pride fair day.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe park is accessible by CityCat ferry disembarking at the New Farm Park ferry wharf and by buses that run along Brunswick Street. There is car parking within the park and on adjacent streets.\n\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nNew Farm Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\nThe changing land use in and around New Farm Park, from Aboriginal resource, to convict farm, from tenant farming to racecourse, from elite residences to suburban subdivision, and finally to parkland, demonstrates the evolution of Queensland's history, and the process of the creation of open spaces as an area's population grew. The Brisbane City Council's purchase of the land at New Farm reflected its interest in the international Town Planning movement of the time. Redesigns of the park also demonstrate changes in parks philosophy and use over time, with a shift in emphasis from genteel Edwardian ornamental gardens and leisure activities, to barbeques and jogging.The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.\nThe Edwardian 1915 bandstand is rare. The park itself can also be considered as a rare example of a new park being designed by Henry Moore, as his other projects involved redeveloping existing parkland (including Bowen and Newstead Parks). The remaining croquet lawn is also uncommon in Queensland.The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.\nThe Edwardian bandstand is a very fine example of its type.The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\nThe park's vistas, jacaranda drive, river frontage, rose gardens, subtropical shrubberies and mature trees including palms, figs and poincianas, demonstrate an established subtropical garden character and are well appreciated by the public.The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.\nThe first Brisbane City Parks Superintendent (from 1912), Henry Moore, horticulturalist and landscape gardener, displayed a high degree of creativity in his initial design of New Farm Park. Features such as the jacaranda drive continue to impress the public. Harry Oakman, landscape architect, also displayed creativity in his post-1948 re-design of the park including the rose beds, although only a remnant of this rose garden design remains. Both men were also innovators in the field of tropical garden design.The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nThe park has a long-standing and strong association with the local community, including the post-war Italian community. The playground is very popular with local mothers and children, and festival organisers, wedding parties, sportspeople, the elderly, and picnickers use other parts of the park.The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.\nNew Farm Park also has an association with the life and work of people of importance: Henry Moore, Harry Oakman, and Albert Herbert Foster, Brisbane's City Architect from 1913 to 1932.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of parks in Brisbane\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Attribution ===\n This Wikipedia article contains material from New Farm Park, an entry in the Queensland Heritage Register published by the State of Queensland under CC-BY 4.0 AU licence, accessed on 22 February 2018.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNew Farm Park",

        "wiki": "Brisbane ( (listen)) is the capital of and the most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of over 2.5 million, and the South East Queensland metropolitan region, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.6 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the historic European settlement and is situated inside a peninsula of the Brisbane River, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) from its mouth at Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges. It sprawls across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs)\u2014most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is \"Brisbanite\", whilst common nicknames include \"Brissy\", \"River City\" and \"Brisvegas\".One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the Aboriginal Turrbal and Jagera nations. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located\u2014which in turn takes its name from Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales at the time of the city's founding\u2014the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. The Moreton Bay penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 kilometres (17 mi) north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur.A diverse city with 32.2% of its metropolitan population being foreign born, Brisbane is classified as a global city, and ranks highly in ratings of liveable cities. Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city's built heritage. The city is noted for its cuisine brunches, outdoor dining, and rooftop bar scene. Brisbane was also the origin of the Anzac Day tradition through the works of Canon David John Garland. \nA transportation hub, Brisbane is served by a large suburban rail network, popular bus and ferry networks as well as Australia's third-busiest airport and seaport.\nBrisbane is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, which are home to numerous popular surf beaches, located immediately south and north of Brisbane respectively. Major landmarks and attractions include South Bank Parklands, the Queensland Cultural Centre (including the Queensland Museum, Queensland Art Gallery, Gallery of Modern Art, Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland), City Hall, the Story Bridge, the Howard Smith Wharves, ANZAC Square, St John's Cathedral, Fortitude Valley (including James Street and Chinatown), West End, the Teneriffe woolstores precinct, the Brisbane River and its Riverwalk network, the City Botanic Gardens, Roma Street Parkland, New Farm Park (including the Brisbane Powerhouse), the Kangaroo Point Cliffs and park, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the Mount Coot-tha Reserve (including Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens), the D'Aguilar Range and National Park, as well as Moreton Bay (including Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands, and coastal suburbs such as Shorncliffe, Wynnum and those on the Redcliffe Peninsula).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-19th century ===\nIndigenous Australians are believed to have lived in coastal South East Queensland for 22,000 years, with an estimated population between 6,000 and 10,000 individuals before white settlement. At this time, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Jagera people, including the Turrbal group, who knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning \"place shaped as a spike\". Archaeological evidence suggests frequent habitation around the Brisbane River, and notably at the site now known as Musgrave Park.Jagara (also known as Jagera, Yagara, and Yuggera) and Yugarabul (also known as Ugarapul and Yuggerabul) are Australian Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland.  There is some uncertainty over the status of Jagara as a language, dialect or perhaps a group or clan within the local government boundaries of Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. The languages of Greater Brisbane are related \u2013 there is uncertainty over which dialects belong to which language. The Yugarabul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Brisbane City Council, Ipswich City Council and the Scenic Rim Regional Council.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Moreton Bay area was initially explored on behalf of European colonisers by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named \"Red Cliff Point\" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay. In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.Oxley claimed, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km (12 mi) upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore. The party settled in Redcliffe on 13 September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km (17 mi) south, which offered a more reliable water supply. The newly selected Brisbane region, at the time, was plagued by mosquitos.After visiting the Redcliffe settlement, Sir Thomas Brisbane then travelled 45 km (28 mi) up the Brisbane River in December 1824. Governor Brisbane stayed overnight in a tent and often landed ashore, bestowing upon Brisbane City the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake. Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838 and the population grew strongly thereafter, with free settlers soon far outstripping the convict population. German missionaries settled at Zions Hill, Nundah as early as 1837, five years before Brisbane was officially declared a free settlement. The band consisted of ministers Christopher Eipper (1813\u20131894) and Carl Wilhelm Schmidt and lay missionaries Haussmann, Johann Gottried Wagner, Niquet, Hartenstein, Zillman, Franz, Rode, Doege and Schneider. They were allocated 260 hectares and set about establishing the mission, which became known as the German Station. Later in the 1860s many German immigrants from the Uckermark region in Prussia as well as other German regions settled in the Bethania- Beenleigh and Darling Downs areas. These immigrants were selected and assisted through immigration programs established by John Dunmore Lang and Johann Christian Heussler and were offered free passage, good wages, and selections of land.The penal settlement under the control of Captain Patrick Logan flourished with the numbers of convicts increasing dramatically from around 200 to over 1000 men. He created a substantial settlement of brick and stone buildings, complete with school and hospital. He formed additional outstations and made several important journeys of exploration. Logan is infamous for his extreme use of the cat o' nine tails on convicts. The maximum allowed limit of lashes was 50; however, Logan regularly applied sentences of 150 lashes.Free settlers entered the area over the following five years, and by the end of 1840, Robert Dixon began work on the first plan of Brisbane Town, in anticipation of future development. Queensland was separated from New South Wales by letters patent dated 6 June 1859, proclaimed by Sir George Ferguson Bowen on 10 December 1859, whereupon he became Queensland's first governor, with Brisbane chosen as its capital.In 1893, Brisbane was affected by the Black February flood, when the Brisbane River burst its banks on three occasions in February and again in June in the same year, with the city receiving more than year's rainfall during February 1893, leaving much of the city's population homeless.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nOver 20 small municipalities and shires were amalgamated in 1925 to form the City of Brisbane, governed by the Brisbane City Council. A significant year for Brisbane was 1930, with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the Shrine of Remembrance, in ANZAC Square, which has become Brisbane's main war memorial. These historic buildings, along with the Story Bridge which opened in 1940, are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city.\nDuring World War II, Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called MacArthur Central) was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to Hollandia in August 1944. MacArthur had previously rejected use of the University of Queensland complex as his headquarters, as the distinctive bends in the river at St Lucia could have aided enemy bombers. Also used as a headquarters by the American troops during World War II was the T & G Building. About one million US troops passed through Australia during the war, as the primary co-ordination point for the South West Pacific. In 1942, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.Postwar Brisbane had developed a \"big country town\" stigma, an image the city's politicians and marketers were very keen to remove. In the late 1950s, an anonymous poet known as The Brisbane Bard generated much attention on the city which helped shake this stigma. Despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The state government under Joh Bjelke-Petersen began a major program of change and urban renewal, beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs. Trams in Brisbane were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969, leaving Melbourne and one line in Adelaide as the last Australian state capitals to operate trams until Sydney begun operation of a new system in 1997.\n\nThe 1974 Brisbane flood was a major disaster which temporarily crippled the city. During this era, Brisbane grew and modernized, rapidly becoming a destination of interstate migration. Some of Brisbane's popular landmarks were lost to development in controversial circumstances, including the Bellevue Hotel in 1979 and Cloudland in 1982. Major public works included the Riverside Expressway, the Gateway Bridge, and later, the redevelopment of South Bank, starting with the Queensland Art Gallery.\nBetween 1968 and 1987, when Queensland was governed by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose government was characterised by strong social conservatism and the use of police force against demonstrators, and which ended with the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption, Brisbane developed a counterculture focussed on the University of Queensland, street marches and Brisbane punk rock music.\nBrisbane hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1988 World Exposition (known locally as World Expo 88). These events were accompanied by a scale of public expenditure, construction, and development not previously seen in the state of Queensland. Brisbane's population growth far exceeded the national average in the last two decades of the 20th century, with a high level of interstate migration from Victoria and New South Wales.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAfter three decades of record population growth, Brisbane was hit again by a major flood in January 2011. The Brisbane River did not reach the same height as the previous 1974 flood, but still caused extensive damage and disruption to the city.Brisbane also hosted major international events including the final Goodwill Games in 2001, the Rugby League World Cup Final in 2008 and again in 2017, as well as the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit.\nPopulation growth has continued to be among the highest of the Australian capital cities in the first two decades of the 21st century, and major infrastructure including the Howard Smith Wharves, Roma Street Parklands, Queens Wharf, the Brisbane Riverwalk, the Queen's Wharf casino and resort precinct, the Brisbane International Cruise Terminal, the Clem Jones, Airport Link, and Legacy Way road tunnels, and the Airport, Springfield, Redcliffe Peninsula and Cross River Rail railway lines have been completed or are under construction.\n\n\n== Geography and environment ==\n\nBrisbane is in the southeast corner of Queensland. The city is centred along the Brisbane River, and its eastern suburbs line the shores of Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea in the Pacific Ocean. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the Great Dividing Range, with the Taylor and D'Aguilar ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the Moreton Bay floodplain between the Gold and Sunshine coasts, approximately from Caboolture in the north to Beenleigh in the south, and across to Ipswich in the south west.\nThe Brisbane River is a wide tidal estuary and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are brackish and navigable. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at Moreton Bay in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the North Pine and South Pine rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the Pine River estuary at Bramble Bay, the Caboolture River further north, the Logan and Albert rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and tributaries of the Brisbane River including the Bremer River in the south-western suburbs, Breakfast Creek in the inner-north, Norman Creek in the inner-south, Oxley Creek in the south, Bulimba Creek in the inner south-east and Moggill Creek in the west. The city is on a low-lying floodplain, with the risk of flooding increased by the many suburban creeks which criss-cross the city.\nThe waters of Moreton Bay are sheltered from large swells by Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands, so whilst the bay can become rough in windy conditions, the waves at Moreton Bay beaches are generally not surfable. Unsheltered surf beaches lie on the eastern coasts of Moreton, Stradbroke and Bribie islands islands and on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast to the north and south. The southern part of Moreton Bay also contains smaller islands such as St Helena Island, Peel Island, Coochiemudlo Island, Russell Island, Lamb Island and Macleay Island.\nThe city of Brisbane is hilly. The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the Herbert Taylor Range, such as the summit of Mount Coot-tha, reaching up to 300 m (980 ft) and the smaller Enoggera Hill. The D'Aguilar National Park, encompassing the D'Aguilar Range, bounds the north-west of Brisbane's built-up area, and contains the taller peaks of Mount Nebo, Camp Mountain, Mount Pleasant, Mount Glorious, Mount Samson and Mount Mee. Other prominent rises in Brisbane are Mount Gravatt and nearby Toohey Mountain. Mount Petrie at 170 m (560 ft) and the lower rises of Highgate Hill, Mount Ommaney, Stephens Mountain, and Whites Hill are dotted across the city.\nMuch of the rock upon which Brisbane is located is the characteristic Brisbane tuff, a form of welded ignimbrite, which is most prominently found at the Kangaroo Point Cliffs at Kangaroo Point and the New Farm Cliffs on the Petrie Bight reach of the Brisbane River. The stone was used in the construction of historical buildings such as the Commissariat Store and Cathedral of St Stephen, and the roadside kerbs in inner areas of Brisbane are still manufactured of Brisbane tuff.\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\n\nBrisbane is located within the South East Queensland biogeographic region, and is home to numerous Eucalyptus varieties. Trees considered iconic to Brisbane include the Moreton Bay fig, a very large evergreen banyan with imposing buttress roots named for the region which are often lit with decorative lights in the inner city, as well as the jacaranda, a subtropical tree native to South America which line avenues and parks throughout Brisbane and bloom with purple flowers during October, referred to locally as 'jacaranda season'. Other trees common to the metropolitan area include Moreton Bay chestnut, broad-leaved paperbark, poinciana, weeping lilli pilli and Bangalow palm. Some of the banks of the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay are home to mangrove wetlands.\nBrisbane is home to numerous bird species, with common species including rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, galahs, Australian white ibises, Australian brushturkeys, Torresian crows, Australian magpies and noisy miners. Common reptiles include common garden skinks, Australian water dragons, bearded dragons and blue-tongued lizards. Common ringtail possums and flying foxes are common in parks and yards throughout the city, as are common crow butterflies, blue triangle butterflies, golden orb-weaver spiders and St Andrew's Cross spiders. The Brisbane River is home to many fish species including yellowfin bream, flathead, Australasian snapper, and bull sharks. The waters of Moreton Bay are home to dugongs, humpback whales, dolphins, mud crabs, soldier crabs, Moreton Bay bugs and numerous shellfish species.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBrisbane has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with hot, wet summers and moderately dry, moderately warm winters. Brisbane experiences an annual mean minimum of 16.6 \u00b0C (62 \u00b0F) and mean maximum of 26.6 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F), making it Australia's second-hottest capital city after Darwin. Seasonality is not pronounced, and average maximum temperatures of above 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) persist from October through to April.\nDue to its proximity to the Coral Sea and a warm ocean current, Brisbane's overall temperature variability is somewhat less than most Australian capitals. Summers are long, hot, and wet, but temperatures only occasionally reach 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) or more. Eighty percent of summer days record a maximum temperature of 27 to 33 \u00b0C (81 to 91 \u00b0F). Winters are short and warm, with average maximums of about 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F); maximum temperatures below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) are rare.\nThe city's highest recorded temperature was 43.2 \u00b0C (109.8 \u00b0F) on Australia Day 1940 at the Brisbane Regional Office, with the highest temperature at the current station being 41.7 \u00b0C (107.1 \u00b0F) on 22 February 2004; but temperatures above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) are uncommon. On 19 July 2007, Brisbane's temperature fell below the freezing point for the first time since records began, registering \u22120.1 \u00b0C (31.8 \u00b0F) at the airport station. The city station has never dropped below 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F), with the average coldest night during winter being around 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F), however locations in the west of the metropolitan area such as Ipswich have dropped as low as \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) with heavy ground frost.In 2009, the current Brisbane weather station recorded its hottest winter day at 35.4 \u00b0C (95.7 \u00b0F) on 24 August; however, on the penultimate day of winter, the Brisbane Regional Office station recorded a temperature of 38.3 \u00b0C (100.9 \u00b0F) on 22 September 1943. The average July day however is around 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) with sunny skies and low humidity, occasionally as high as 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F), whilst maximum temperatures below 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) are uncommon and usually associated with brief periods of cloud and winter rain. The highest minimum temperature ever recorded in Brisbane was 28.0 \u00b0C (82.4 \u00b0F) on 29 January 1940 and again on 21 January 2017, whilst the lowest maximum temperature was 10.2 \u00b0C (50.4 \u00b0F) on 12 August 1954.Annual precipiation is ample. From November to March, thunderstorms are common over Brisbane, with the more severe events accompanied by large damaging hail stones, torrential rain and destructive winds. On an annual basis, Brisbane averages 124 clear days. Dewpoints in the summer average at around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F); the apparent temperature exceeds 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) on almost all summer days. Brisbane's wettest day occurred on 21 January 1887, when 465 millimetres (18.3 in) of rain fell on the city, the highest maximum daily rainfall of Australia's capital cities. The wettest month on record was February 1893, when 1,025.9 millimetres (40.39 in) of rain fell, although in the last 30 years the record monthly rainfall has been a much lower 479.8 millimetres (18.89 in) from December 2010. Very occasionally a whole month will pass with no recorded rainfall, the last time this happened was August 1991. The city has suffered three major floods since its founding, in February 1893, January 1974 (partially a result of Cyclone Wanda), and January 2011 (partially a result of Cyclone Tasha).\nBrisbane is within the southern reaches of the tropical cyclone risk zone. Full strength tropical cyclones rarely affect Brisbane, but they do occasionally. The biggest risk is ex tropical cyclones which can cause destructive winds and flooding rains.The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from 21.0 \u00b0C (69.8 \u00b0F) in July to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in February.\n\n\n== Urban structure ==\n\nThe Brisbane central business district (CBD, colloquially referred to as 'the city') lies in a curve of the Brisbane river. The CBD covers 2.2 km2 (0.8 sq mi) and is walkable. Most central streets are named after members of the House of Hanover. Queen Street (named in honour of Queen Victoria) is Brisbane's traditional main street and contains its largest pedestrian mall, the Queen Street Mall. Streets named after female members (Adelaide, Alice, Ann, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Mary) run parallel to Queen Street and perpendicular to streets named after male members (Albert, Edward, George, and William).\nThe CBD's squares include King George Square, Post Office Square and ANZAC Square (home to the city's central war memorial).\nBrisbane's metropolitan area is broadly and colloquially divided into the 'northside' and the 'southside', with the dividing line being the Brisbane River, as crossing one of the fifteen bridges across the river is required to travel to the opposite side by land transport. This results in many areas which are south of the CBD being classified as located in the 'northside', and vice versa, as a result of the river's winding trajectory. In addition to being classified as located on the 'northside' or 'southside' there are further broad and colloquial regions such as the 'westside' for some areas to the southwest of the CBD and the 'bayside' for areas located on the coast of Moreton Bay.\nGreater Brisbane had a density of 148 inhabitants per square kilometre (380/sq mi) in 2016. Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.\nFrom the 1970s onward, there has been a large increase in the construction of apartment developments, including mid-rise and high rise buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2016 census, 76.4% of residents lived in separate houses, 12.6% lived in apartments, and 10% lived in townhouses, terrace houses, or semidetached houses.\n\n\n=== Parklands ===\n\nBrisbane's major parklands include the riverside City Botanic Gardens at Gardens Point, Roma Street Parkland, the 27-hectare Victoria Park at Spring Hill and Herston, South Bank Parklands along the river at South Bank, the Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Mount Coot-tha and the riverside New Farm Park at New Farm.\nThere are many national parks surrounding the Brisbane metropolitan area. The D'Aguilar National Park is a major national park along the northwest of the metropolitan area in the D'Aguilar Range. The Glass House Mountains National Park is located to the north of the metropolitan area in the Glass House Mountains and provides green space between the Brisbane metropolitan area and the Sunshine Coast. The Tamborine National Park at Tamborine Mountain is located in the Gold Coast hinterland to the south of the metropolitan area.\nThe eastern metropolitan area is built along the Moreton Bay Marine Park, encompassing Moreton Bay. Significant areas of Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands also covered by the Moreton Island National Park, Naree Budjong Djara National Park and the Bribie Island National Park respectively. The Boondall Wetlands in the suburb of Boondall include 1100 hectares of wetlands which are home to mangroves and shorebirds as well as walking tracks.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBrisbane has retained many heritage buildings, some of which date back to the 1820s, including The Old Windmill in Wickham Park, built by convict labour in 1824, which is the oldest surviving building in Brisbane, and the Commissariat Store on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used as a grainhouse, and is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane and contains a museum. Other 19th and early 20th-century buildings of architectural significance include the Treasury Building, City Hall, Customs House and the Land Administration Building.\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as Queenslander architecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large verandahs, gabled corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few terrace houses being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature Queenslander-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\nBrisbane is home to several of Australia's tallest buildings and it is ranked among world cities with the most skyscrapers. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. Brisbane's tallest building is currently Brisbane Skytower, which has a height of 270 metres.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBrisbane's Greater Capital City Statistical Area includes the Local Government Areas of City of Brisbane, City of Ipswich, Moreton Bay Region, Logan City and Redland City, as well as parts of Lockyer Valley Region, Scenic Rim Region and Somerset Region, which form a continuous metropolitan area. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the population of Greater Brisbane is 2,514,184 as of June 2019, making it the third largest city in Australia.\n\n\n=== Ancestry and immigration ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:\n\nThe 2016 census showed that 32.2% of Brisbane's inhabitants were born overseas and 50.9% of inhabitants had at least one parent born overseas. Brisbane has the 26th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas.

The Port of Brisbane located at the Brisbane River's mouth on Moreton Bay and on the adjacent Fisherman's Island, created by means of land reclamation. It is the 3rd busiest port in Australia for value of goods. Container freight, sugar, grain, coal and bulk liquids are the major exports. Most of the port facilities are less than three decades old and some are built on reclaimed mangroves and wetlands. The Port is a part of the Australia TradeCoast, which includes the Brisbane Airport along with large industrial estates located along both banks at the mouth of the Brisbane River.White-collar industries include information technology, financial services, higher education and public sector administration generally concentrated in and around the central business district and satellite hubs located in the inner suburbs such as South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley, Spring Hill, Milton and Toowong.\nBlue-collar industries, including petroleum refining, stevedoring, paper milling, metalworking and QR railway workshops, tend to be located on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River proximal to the Port of Brisbane and in new industrial zones on the urban fringe.\nTourism is an important part of the Brisbane economy, both in its own right and as a gateway to other areas of Queensland, as international education, with over 95,000 international students enrolled in universities and other tertiary education institutions in the central Brisbane City Council local government area alone in 2018.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail in the CBD is centred around the Queen Street Mall, which is Queensland's largest pedestrian mall.

Since the creation of the City of Brisbane in 1925 the urban areas of Brisbane have expanded considerably past the council boundaries. The City of Brisbane local government area is by far the largest local government area (in terms of population and budget) in Australia, serving more than 40% of the GCCSA's population. It was formed by the merger of twenty smaller LGAs in 1925, and covers an area of 1,367 km2 (528 sq mi). There is a directly-elected Lord Mayor, and a council composed of councillors representing 26 wards.

In some segments, the Riverwalk is built over the river. The longest span of the Riverwalk connects Newstead in the east with Toowong in the west.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nBrisbane Airport (IATA code: BNE) is the city's main airport, the third busiest in Australia after Sydney Airport and Melbourne Airport. It is located north-east of the city centre on Moreton Bay and provides domestic and international passenger services. In the 2017, Brisbane Airport handled over 23 million passengers. The airport is an airline hub for Qantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar, Tigerair Australia as well as a number of minor and freight airlines. The airport is served by the Airtrain service which runs on the Airport line, providing a direct service to the CBD.\nArcherfield Airport in Brisbane's southern suburbs, Redcliffe Airport  on the Redcliffe Peninsula and Caboolture Airfield in the far north of the metropolitan area serve Brisbane as general aviation airports.\nBrisbane is also served by other major airports in South East Queensland, including Gold Coast Airport at Coolangatta, Sunshine Coast Airport at Marcoola and Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport at Wellcamp.\n\n\n==== Seaport ====\n\nThe Port of Brisbane is located at the mouth of the Brisbane River on Moreton Bay and on the adjacent Fisherman's Island, an artificial island created by land reclamation.

The port has 29 operating berths including nine deep-water container berths and three deep-water bulk berths as well as 17 bulk and general cargo berths.\nThere are two cruise ship terminals in Brisbane. Portside Wharf at Hamilton is an international standard facility for cruise liners. Due to the height of the Gateway Bridge which must be passed to reacch the terminal, the wharf services small and medium-sized cruise ships. The Brisbane International Cruise Terminal at Luggage Point in Pinkenba is able to accommodate the largest cruise vessels in the world, and will be opened in 2020.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nBrisbane is covered by Queensland Health's \"Metro North\" and \"Metro South\" Health Service Networks.

          "Caught the citycat here on a Saturday night and it was the nicest way to get there. We got pork belly, massaman curry with prata, gyoza, pork buns, haloumi fries and karage chicken to share. For dessert it was cheeaecake cigars, fried ice cream and canoli. Some things we found",
          "Had a great time trying all types of different food here. Pretty crowded and hectic at times but overall it was a great experience and definitely worth going to!",
          "We went as a family, a total of 12 people all ages. We were lucky that it wasn't crowded so we were able to find a table under the roof as it rained on and off. Generally it was quite expensive, that in itself was not a problem when the food was great. It should be said that",
          "Second time at Eat Street and enjoyed it again. It's interesting as it has some small shops in there with food places and a bar then there's live music and some bars spots sat on the river, which we enjoyed on the evening. There was a wedding happening when we went which was a",
          "Situated on the North Shore right by the river, Eat Street Markets is a great little place to visit. Be warned the queues for parking are long but there is a good amount of parking available once you have arrived. There is a $3 entry charge to the \u2018markets\u2019 where you can find a",
          "There is a good selection of food for sure but a little pricey, they had live music when we were there but cabaret style and not our cup of tea, beer was mainly flowery craft beer and $8 for a middie sized plastic cup, we caught the ferry up and back and whilst worth a look we",
          "If an overcrowded open air food court with nowhere to sit and eat your food sounds appealing then Eat Street is the place for you. Try to enjoy eating while your whole family is balancing on a couple of pallets covered with AstroTurf. Or circle the couple of real tables like",
          "We often head to Eat Street with the whole family on a Saturday night- it does get busy so we tend to go earlier, around 6ish to avoid the crows. We are always happy with our food- the pork belly burger from the end of Laneway is my fave but we're also big fans of the Mexican",
          "We've lived in Queensland now for three years and, I don't know how, have never heard of this place. Well, it was fantastic. Amazing food options, reasonably priced lager/drinks (and you can even wonder around with your alcohol, like in the UK and Europe) and just an amazing",
          "Came here on a Saturday night so it was naturally busy but some people were hogging seats, so more seating with tables would be good. Plenty of variety to choose from and reasonable prices, just don't understand why you have to pay to enter - even the Taste of Tasmania you",
          "Whether there as a family, with friends or as couples this place can cater for everyone. Built on the side of the river out of shipping containers this place others different cuisines in each container! Having been twice before this was the first time I\u2019ve been on a Friday night",
          "Went here for the first time as we were attending the Cirque du Soleil nearby. Firstly, can't understand why you need to pay $3 pp to get in? Then the crowds are such that it was hard to find anywhere to sit to have your selected meal. As for the food, its just your usual",
          "A novel idea to combine shipping containers by the river, splash a lot of colour with a carnival theme and serve street food from around the world. Parking at location is free, entry was $3 per person, we arrived at 4:00pm Saturday and the crowd was still manageable but be",
          "Uber drivers have good tips. My driver recommended a stop at Eat Street which is built out of old shipping containers. Inside each container is a different food vendors similar to the gourmet food trucks you see in the US. Lots of craft beer, wine and several stages playing live",
          "If you like the hustle and bustle and choice of an asian street market, but with spotlessly clean surroundings and live music, Eat Street's weekend extravaganzas are tremendous. Just about every food taste must be catered for with the huge variety, and the beers, ales and ciders",
          "It was very busy, but a great bustling atmosphere. They've cleverly used shipping containers to house different cuisines from all over the world. There are places with live music dotted around too, but unfortunately we were dodging heavy showers. I'd recommend walking around a",
          "Come prepared for too many choices but all look amazing! We got there earlier which was a good idea as it does get busy although the stalls still pump out their food. We shared a few things just so we could try more!",
          "We haven\u2019t been for a few months so went tonight. Not enough seating if there is rain, people holding multiple tables for over an hour with just drinks and spare seats. After someone else sat in the container area we sat down with their rubbish and then copped a mouthful because",
          "After hearing about Eat Street from so many people it was great to finally get to visit myself. We must have timed our arrival well as we had no problem getting a decent park. Once inside we walked from one end to the other before claiming a table that our group took turns at",
          "Decided to travel on the City Cat to the mouth of the river and discovered this place. Absolutely fantastic. I am very impressed with the atmosphere, variety foods available and their dedication to recycling.",
          "We first went on Friday night and found that it was so convenient and had so many choices we ate there Saturday and Sunday nights also. Daughter did eat the same thing three times (macaroni and cheese), but she said it was the best meal she had in Australia. Wife and I tried",
          "We went on a Friday night between Xmas and New Year although the place was very busy we didn\u2019t have to wait too long for the food. There was no seating around the main stage or in the Laneway, but there was still places that you could sit and eat your food. The choice of food",
          "It's not really much of a market (only a few places to purchase things) but there are plenty of foodie places to eat. Different cuisine from loads of different countries. All of your favorites but great to try something new too. So much choice! There's a small charge or get in",
          "A great venue. We booked a private room, container area which was perfect, right beside the river. We had a bar tab, wrist bands for drinks which worked very well. Our guests purchased their own food, many of our guests had not been to Eat Street before and were very impressed.",
          "Oh my golly gosh those kiwi lads where great! Good funny role play payout of Beyonc\u00e9 and so on and breakdance that my kids just loved! The best concert for BNE swing in! Food is getting overpriced I felt compared to the last few years we have been stopping in at Eat St. Even",

          "We took the cat ferry from South bank to Northshore Hamilton and the journey along the Brisbane River took 60mins with multiple stops. Some interesting sights along the river and the fare was less than A$5. A cab ride will cost about A$22 and much faster, about 15mins from South",
          "It was very much like the food alley at the Brisbane (or any) Ekka. Noisy, unattractive and not a great selection/variety of food. Also there were stalls offering goods apart from food.",

          "Brilliant place to visit. Shopping, live entertainment. Rock bands, magic shows. Called eat street I guess because you can try food from all-around the world.  Must be done when you visit Brisbane.",
          "Great food, fantastic atmosphere with a variety of entertainment and easy to get to, some of us travelled via City Cat and others via car. A huge range of food items from all over the world. The hardest thing was deciding what to eat. \u2026",
          "So much variety. Great vibe, good live music. Fun place to visit. Highly recommend a visit here especially when you're really hungry. You'll want to eat at every place!",
          "Great vibe here, live music and great variety of different foods. Did not leave hungry. It was busy but very little wait time and we found seating easily.  Parking is free with a $3/ person entry fee over the age of 12 . Under 12's free.",
          "A friend brought us here and we really liked it. We had some great food and desserts. There were bands playing and the view to the river was fantastic. Prices were reasonable. Would go back any time.",
          "Amazing food at reasonable prices. The place is very well organised, without being too crowded in Sunday afternoon. Compared to all the other food markets we\u2019ve been to, this is so enjoyable. Will definitely be back soon!",
          "The atmosphere on a balmy summer evening was delightful. Lots of happy people of all ages. The food was variable I tried a fabulous Filipino dish, an uninspired Chinese dish and a dessert that was very disappointing - especially for the price. In a restaurant I would have sent it back - which I have only done once before.",
          "A must visit for locals, and those who are just stopping in to Brisbane. Whilst some contend the $3 entry fee, I feel it is validated for the incredible experience you get with at least three entertainment areas - to draw in both adults and \u2026",
          "So good to just wander around with my family trying new things and relaxing",
          "Love coming to Eat Street! So many amazing food options and caters to everyone. Perfect for a group of friends or a date night! If you haven't been you need to go!",
          "Wide range of international street food. Something for everyone. All the outlets seem to use biodegradable cutlery and plates which is awesome!",
          "An awesome place to go for some very diverse food options. It's a bit of a disaster finding a park so I suggest getting there when it first opens and try to leave an hour or so before it closes. There's some awesome function areas, some offer an unobstructed view of the harbour and your own private bar",
          "It\u2019s great that it is a permanent location that is always readily available. It\u2019s a cute date night location which is dog friendly and that\u2019s great! It\u2019s just quite overpriced with its \u201cmarket\u201d feel.",
          "It's one of those generic pop-up food street places that are sprouting all over major cities. Generic feel, average food, lots of people. Go there if you're in a group and you'd have a good time. Also check their weekly performance roster \u2026",
          "Wonderful vibe with, live music, a nice kids area and so many food options! Being vegan I was concerned I\u2019d end up with the standard chips and salad as my food options but I was pleasantly surprised to find several vendors had decent vegan options! \nWill definitely be returning :)",
          "Love this place. Would recommend paying to hire one of the reserved areas as seating is hard to come by. Prob better to either plan to go a little earlier or have a late dinner as it gets very busy around 6pm",
          "Eat street is definitely the place to go when you have a family all with different tastes. There is something for everyone at Eat Street and it's always an enjoyable time. The only reason it's 4 starts and not 5 is because there isn't enough seating. It's always really difficult to find seating",
          "Interesting place to try a variety of food from different corners of the world. Live music on the day we visited. Plenty of parking available. $3 pp entry charge. Most stalls we tried are quite good.",
          "WOW great selection of food in different sections and thought value for money was good. $3 entry fee which is ok by me. They have entertainment as well which I thought was good. Its a family orientated place and you'll feel very safe. My only downside to this was the drink options were a bit limited but still good.",
          "A great place to hang out with friends. Listen to the music, play games, eat foreign food and mostly take photos. The bright lights and beautiful exterior just make the place even more amazing. However, the pricings can be on the higher side.",
          "Nice atmosphere, pets friendly. The best selection of foods from all over the world. A little bit pricey but worthwhile to visit.",
          "So much variety in food you just want to eat it all. So hard deciding. Good entertainment as well. Usually always find a park within decent distance from entrance. Parking was free but charged entry fee.",
          "Incredible food options, significant Coeliac dining options. Very busy; if you do not enjoy being in crowds then I do not recommend coming here. Dog friendly as long as they are on a leash.",
          "This space has a creative hipster energy and attracts a diverse crowd of people. It's all about great food and enjoying it with good friends. Bring your family and your mates and try some new flavors, you're bound to find something here that you haven't tried before.",
          "This is probably the only place in Brisbane that you can call truly multi cuisine. Treat yourself with an evening full of flavours from around the world. Reasonably priced options allows you to try out multiple things. Food, music and good \u2026",
          "I thought this would be like just a bunch of food vans, but it was so much more. It felt more like a carnival atmosphere with the fairy lights all over, live bands (yes, plural) and a wonderous variety of food from these vendors that were \u2026",
          "A definite must for visitors to Brisbane. So many different food stalls to chose from. \nThere's typically live entertainment also.\nMy only warning is that it can get very busy. Be prepared if you have little ones with you!\n\nTake some cash( \u2026",
          "Awesome atmosphere, amazing variety of great food on offer. Very popular spot. Great for all types, kids included. Beautiful views of the river. The place was clean and tidy despite the large crowd. Access is easy and there are people directing traffic in the carpark. I'd be a regular if I lived in the area!",
          "Such a fun place to be with family, pets, kids, friends. The band performing was keeping everyone grooving to the \u201800s tunes. Great variety of food, indian, Mexican, Peruvian, Greek, American diner (quick tip-serves alcohol).\n\nMost of the \u2026",
          "Eat Street must be experienced when in  Brisbane. Its open from 4.pm to 10pm Friday and Saturday. Food from all parts of the world on offer. Craft beers and so much more. The Marinade lamb or beef is a must from Marinade.",
          "Good food, good beer and relax and chilled music. Could have been 5 star if there were more seats, not that I know where to put them - the place is packed for a good reason",
          "I attended here in December of 2017 & it was a very welcoming experience the only bad thing about this place is they allow dogs. & it\u2019s not a good mix with dogs & people & there was nearly a dog fight. I think you should ban the dogs as the dogs really don\u2019t want to be walking around in amongst people\u2019s feet.",
          "Something for everyone.  Great live entertainment. You can bring your date, your dog, your kids or just yourself and still have a great time. Only $3 entry and free parking makes for a great visit without time restraints.",
          "Great vibes. Great music. Good food. Requires a small entry fees. Food is generally slightly expensive but that is reflected in the facilities.",
          "This is an awesome night market in a well lit colourful environment. Lots of yummy food options. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Eat Street in general is great and a lot of variety. \n\nBut I would never recommend the Mexican place. I asked for a vegetarian burrito and this is what I got. Rice and cheese only and I could count the beans on one hand.\n\n$15 including one dollop of guacamole with a single corn chip. No thanks!",
          "A fun, packed street food style venue. Heaps of fun for friends and family, good vibes and seriously tasty food. \ud83c\udf7b\ud83c\udf5c\ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf66",
          "Love it. Not too busy if you go EARLY! Around 645-7pm-ish it gets very crowded and busy in both eat street and the car parks. Great atmosphere for all ages. And pet friendly which is amazing! And an amazing view over the water. There is an entry fee so don't for get cash to get in, it's normally around $3 per head.",
          "Came here on a Saturday afternoon with girlfriends, the atmosphere was amazing with all the lights and live music. Food was superb as well as the cocktails. Also, was not too pricey",
          "An amazing food hub for foodies and the hungry alike come togeather to congregate having a fun time.\nMust go with friends or family to truly understand my meaning.",
          "I loved this place.  You must pay in cash .  Essentially, street food or fast food from countries around the world . Healthy and variable . I really liked it.",
          "Great variety of foods. From traditional dishes to carnival fare. Alcohol is abundant so lots to choose from. They even have wine on tap. Nice for an afternoon or for bringing guests from the out of town",
          "Last hour entrance is FOC otherwise its $3. Wide variety of food available here and most of them are pretty awesome too. Large number of parking spaces (free) too.",
          "Best place to go with children, for family. Great park, water sprinklers for kids. Barbecues, toilets. Clean & well maintained.",
          "Great place for family outings. Even allowed to bring pets (dogs, birds ect) on the condition they are people friendly and leashed. Mostly great customer service and great food. Modertly priced.",
          "Great atmosphere, and plenty of options to choose from. We got there early which is the best thing to do, as it gets crowded around 6pm. Very limited seating area, which was tricky. A lot of cash only shops as well, but there are atms \u2026",
          "Get in as early as you can. This place can get very busy making it difficult to find tables to eat for bigger groups. Also suggest that you plan where you are going to eat before you get there otherwise the amount of specialty foods can get \u2026",
          "Foodie heaven! Takoyaki and the oyster bar is my absolute favourite!",
          "Busy, carnival atmosphere. Low quality food but it's fun with a group, and very popular! Parking was provided too!",
          "There's something for everyone. You could spend hours there. All stalls and signs were beautiful lit up and decorated. Everyone was soo friendly and welcoming.",
          "Quite a good choice food - not so much for vegetarians but we found a couple suitable dishes. Fun place with entertainment by the river - I think open Fri to Sunday but best check",
          "My tip is always get in when it opens, easily eat what you want and leave before the crowds! Heaps of parking, Citycat stop is close by now too! Everyone has to at least try this place once in their lifetime!",
          "Looking for something to do? This place is worth checking out. Shame you have to pay to get in. Great range of food, little over priced for some of the food. Need more stalls. Would go again.",
          "1. The adult ticket is 3 dollars.\n2. Everyone is relax and happy, it had great performance in any corner.\n3. You can get a drink, but the food is...hmm..",

          "All ways inviting to go to to catch up with friends. It doesn't matter where you end up sitting there is entertainment so close. The variety of food is awesome. It just makes you want to keep coming back. Even the cleaners get in on the action",
          "Great place to bring visitors from abroad who want to experience the foody night life Brisbane has to offer. But prices are a concern for the quality of food you get in return. However love the live entertainment.",
          "Good vibe. Plenty of food options at a reasonable price. There are a few shops and free entertainment in the form of bands. Well worth the $3 entrance fee.",
          "The first time i came here was in 2016 and it was and still great place great food and atmospheric place for enjoying the weekend, also the concert and the singers amazing. I love to enjoy the ttime there however I really recommend to try \u2026",
          "I\u2019ve been to Eat Street twice now. It\u2019s always nice to try something new and it is reasonably cheap since all the vendors are competing against each other!\n\nLast visit I tried Ameri-Seoul which is a Korean-American fusion street food. It was pretty tasty.",
          "The venue is great.\n\nHowever, I think a couple of the food places need to be reassessed for food safety. One in particular is L\u2019Apero. And the other is \u201cMexican Food\u201d next to South American Grill. \n\nOrdering a beef brisket fries dish. The \u2026",
          "Prepare to gorge yourself! Best experienced shared with friends you can attempt to try it all!

There was a Halloween show on the Saturday we went, that was actually really entertaining, so all in a all, a great night out.",
          "Fun place to go with friends. They have fantastic entertainment and the food is delicious with almost anything you think of you'll find. \nHowever, it's very loud, even in areas not near the entertainment they will sometimes blast background \u2026",

          "A little overrated, but you're guaranteed to have a good time. Food delivers what it promises, but personally didn't really wow me much. That's just me though, maybe i'm just salty I missed out on the live music. It is a great place to see and have fun at.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is an 18-hectare (44-acre) Koala Sanctuary in the Brisbane suburb of Fig Tree Pocket in Queensland, Australia.\nFounded in 1927, it is the world's oldest and largest koala sanctuary.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name originates from a lone hoop pine that was planted by the Clarkson family, the first owners of the 4.6-hectare (11-acre) site. The sanctuary opened in 1927 to provide a safe refuge to sick, injured, and orphaned koalas, at a time when they were being killed for their fur. The founder of the sanctuary, Claude Reid, recognised the need to protect this iconic species and initiated the protection of their habitat.The sanctuary began with two koalas called Jack and Jill. Lone Pine became known internationally during World War II when Americans, including Douglas MacArthur's wife, visited the park to view the native Australian animals.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\nWildlife in the sanctuary includes: koalas, kangaroos, Tasmanian devils, wombats, echidnas, and various species of reptiles, as well as a platypus that arrived at the sanctuary during 2010 from Healesville Sanctuary (near Melbourne).\nVisitors are allowed to hold koalas for a fee. Strict regulations ensure that each koala is not held for more than thirty minutes every day. Fees paid for souvenir photos help fund new enclosures, research projects and eucalyptus plantations.\nVisitors can feed and pet the free-roaming kangaroos in the 5-acre (2.0 ha) kangaroo reserve, where more than 130 of the animals freely reside.\nThere are also many colourful Australian parrots and cockatoos, as well as other Australian birds such as kookaburras, emus, and cassowaries. Rainbow lorikeets fly to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary for the specially prepared nectar meals at the sanctuary. Visitors can feed the lorikeets directly twice a day. Once a day there is a bird of prey show with several kinds of raptors showing off their speed agility and keen eyesight.\nThe Tasmanian Devils are fed in the afternoon. 'Koala Forest' is a large koala enclosure with over 30 koalas surrounding the customers. Koalas there are fed mid-morning and mid-afternoon.\nAs well as being a wildlife sanctuary, there is a small 'farm', with \"Sheep Dog Shows\".\nLone Pine Koala Sanctuary opened their new world-class koala science and research facility, the Brisbane Koala Science Institute, on Saturday 30 June 2018. Constructed in collaboration with the Brisbane City Council, the facility is home to two full-time research staff, a research laboratory, and a \u2018Koala Biobank\u2019 (koala genetic depository). Through joint projects with universities and other research establishments, the Institute will be working towards real, practical outcomes for local koala populations. Taking advantage of the sanctuary\u2019s central location, Lone Pine hopes to improve collaboration within the science community through the use of the Institutes\u2019 meeting spaces and seminar hall. Guests to Lone Pine will be able to enjoy the Institute daily from 9am-5pm, via the public viewing area complete with interactive displays, koala skywalk, and viewing windows into the sanctuary\u2019s wildlife kitchen, research laboratory, and wildlife hospital. Access to the facility is included in entry to the sanctuary.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThere is an entrance to the sanctuary from a car park, and also an entrance to the sanctuary from the Brisbane River. One can arrive by private car or taxi, a journey of approximately 20 minutes from the city. One can also catch a Brisbane Transport bus, or arrive by ferry from the Queensland Cultural Centre pontoon, a journey of approximately 1\u00bd hours.\n\n\n== Photos ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \"location\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAustralian Koala Foundation\nMarsupial\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAustralian Wildlife Our Brisbane \u2013 information includes Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary\nWildlife, Parks and Gardens \u2013 SunZine",

          "Visited this site 33 years ago when it was a small park like setting with only koalas but back then you could hold and pet them all you wanted with a caretaker near. Now it's a little different but so many other animals there to see. Well worth the short trip by bus #445 to",
          "We visited Lone Pine for a day during our visit to Australia over the Christmas period for 8 weeks. It was good value for money and provided a different experience to Australia Zoo where we had visited 5 years ago during our previous trip. The sheep dog demonstration was",
          "I spent a full day trip with the platinum formula and got back a really nice experience. The very well prepared park guide Megan supported by the team of vets, trainers and keepers brought me around each corner of the park, illustrating, explaining and letting me interact with",
          "If you have a limited time in the area and want to see a koala as well as other animals native to Australia this is definitely worth the visit. We booked in advance the Wild Encounter which give you a more up close and personal experience with the koalas which also saves us from",
          "I learned so much about koalas! You can easily tell that they are well taken care of, as the other animals. I love that there is no pressure on the animals and that if they don\u2019t want to interact with people. I recommend it and ask all to help with donations so the sanctuary can",
          "Very good family outing. Staff and facilities excellent, good food venue, great bird show and plenty of hands on with Koalas and Kangaroos All family loved it",
          "There is no better place to see so many koalas and get up close to kangaroos. It\u2019s small so it is easy to do in half a day and see everything. My only complaint is the cuddle/photo with a koala is way to quick. Probably 20 seconds of holding a koala. The photographer didn\u2019t",
          "This area is absolutely beautiful. I would recommend taking the river cruise from the downtown area over to the sanctuary. It is beautiful and you see beautiful homes on the water as you get to the sanctuary. In this sanctuary you will see all types of indigenous species to",
          "Would highly recommend this place. We went with 2 families and the kids really enjoyed being able to see and touch the koalas but there are heaps of other animals there as well. Food was reasonably priced and ok for a theme park type place and we took our Tesla and they have",
          "First stop after landing in Australia(17 Hours) I cuddle Babies in Childrens Hospital in the states and this was a very special Cuddle for me.. Loved the one on one Kangaroos experience. Everyone was super nice.",
          "Very interesting this Lone Pine Sanctuary. Animals are very cute and this is best place for them. We love this day.",
          "In our 2 week road trip we had not seen kangaroos or koalas so chose to come here Well laid out and lots of things happening throughout the day Enjoyed the raptor show Saw a duck billed platypus at the second visit during the day Clearly caring staff and volunteers Loved seeing",
          "A trip no tourist will want to miss, when in Brisbane, is the excursion out to the Lone Pine Sanctuary about 12km southwest of the city. The most attractive way to get there is by a cruise on the river Brisbane, which takes about 75 minutes and which is interesting in its own",
          "We took our overseas visitors to this park so they could see some of our native animals. You can see native animals and particularly koalas up close. Good commentary by staff at feeding times. Free range area where you can feed kangaroos, wallabies and emus. Food available for",
          "Great day, my grandchildren really enjoyed getting close to the animals. The staff were extremely helpful and obviously passionate about the animals welfare.",
          "What a great day out! A really informative river cruise taking 75 minutes from central Brisbane up to Lone Pine. At lone pine there are a number of animals to see and also interact with - Dingo, lots of Koala, wombats, Kangeroos and Tasmanian Devils as well as reptiles and",
          "Absolutely loved this place ! A real memory maker. Buy the Roo food for $2-00 & spend ages cuddling & feeding them food. Used the boat transfer from Brisbane. Really lovely. Highly recommend.",
          "Our grand daughter loved her photo with the Koala but the highlight for her was feeding the kangaroos in the paddock. She felt very safe and the food is plentiful for them. We had to buy our 2 grandchildren a cuddly kangaroo as we left !!,",
          "Love this place. Plenty of animals. Many which you can interact with. Pay for holding snakes & koalas. I managed the whole park in 3hrs.",
          "If you want to see Australian animals up close, this is the place to visit and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Koalas, kangaroos, wombats, platypus, echidna, dingoes, Tassie devils, cassowary and emus are just some of the animals you will see. Arriving by ferry its just a short climb",
          "We were there on a hot day over Christmas.A lot of animals were asleep which was disappointing for our grandchildren. But there were plenty of koalas and kangaroos to see. The platypus exhibit was the highlight as they were very active while the children were watching. A great",
          "You can hold koala for pictures, you can touch semi-wild kangaroo and emu in the huge yard. And you can see a lot of unique animals in Australia here, even platypus.",
          "It\u2019s closer than travelling to Brisbane - a sound place to take kids but slightly underwhelming - it\u2019s a place you would go once and hard pressed to find reason to go again.",
          "This is one of the oldest Koala sanctuary, but if you love animals especially koalas you will love the Lone pine, one of the few places where you can still cuddle a koala. It is only half a day trip but worth it.",
          "I I have always been fascinated by the wide range of animals that are in Australia. I was quite excited when I found out that lone Pine was the only facility in the country that cared for exclusively Australian animals. My original question was for a facility that allowed",
          "If you want to do something different then come here, we enjoyed it tremendously. The animals were so funny and had no fear when being handled. We thought it would be an hour's visit but we stayed nearly all day and loved it.",
          "We had a great family day out and really loved it. Will be coming back and bringing/ telling friends.",
          "We enjoyed cuddling the koalas. We had booked before we got there and everything ran to time. The bears are cute and the staff knowledgeable",
          "Animals are well cared for and the grounds are lush and green. We hand fed the sheep and kangaroos who were relaxed under the shade of trees. We watched the lorikeets enjoy a feed. Perfect day out for families, plenty of parking, buy tickets online to save, souvenir shops and",
          "Myself and my husband went to the scantuary just before Christmas. We went down by boat and back on the bus. We had a fantastic day up close with the animals we loved it. Would highly recommend it. The staff are fantastic.",
          "Loved it here. Friendly staff and you get to cuddle a koala bear. Highly recommend for a day/ half day trip with family",
          "Awesome awesome experience great way to spend some time. You don\u2019t need a lot of time to get around and see all the animals up close. I highly recommend.",
          "We caught the bus from city centre, really easy. We pre-booked tickets on line which was cheaper. Although the kola experience was sold out. Loads of Kola's and kangaroos to look at. Place felt clean and well organised. Would recommend for all ages. You can feed kangaroos",
          "Great day out at the koala sanctuary - very hot but still managed to see lots of koalas and Australian animals. Educational and fun for all ages. Opportunity to get up close with a koala too. Extremely hot day and disappointed there were not many water fountains/places to fill",
          "Visitors and residents alike should not miss Lone Pine Sanctuary. Located so close to Brisbane and accessible by a pleasant ferry ride from Brisbane City, Lone Pine features a delightful environment with an abundant selection of Australian flora,fauna and Australian wildlife.",
          "This sanctuary was so well organised it was a pleasure to visit. The staff were friendly and lovely with the animals especially the Koala's. Plenty for all and lots of organised displays - the Owl and Hawks display with them flying free was fabulous and very informative. We",
          "Lone Pine Sanctuary was a delight to visit. The animals all appeared healthy and happy and there was a lot to see. Our only disappointment was that the timings of \u2018contact\u2019 experiences were not good in respect of our river transportation. We did however enjoy the day",
          "We had a great time getting to see the variety of animals being very well cared for. Highly recommend",
          "Returning to Brisbane as a visitor compared to once being a resident, I found Lone Pine Koala Sactuary exhibits absolutely amazing. Naturally many improvements have been made over the years and we took advantage of the scheduled information sessions on offer. These",
          "Amazing ! Perfect place to take time to see the most of famous Australian\u2019s animals like Koalas Kangourou Wambat Tasmanian Devils Dingo. I realized \u00e0 think on my bucket list to see And take a Koalas.",
          "The park was fun. The animals seem to be well cared for. The prices were reasonable. I loved the bird show and sheep dog shows.",
          "This is a must..... really good day out, much more than just Koalas.... but to be fair seeing them was enough. Highly recommended to do it with the boat cruise, absolutely stunning views",
          "A well run sanctuary of Koalas where you can get your photograph taken up close or even holding one. Plenty of Wallabies and kangaroos roaming around as well as farm animals, birds, dingos, platypus and plenty more. A fun and interesting day out for the family young and old.",
          "If you love Koalas, Kangaroos and many other Australian marsupials, reptiles and birds, then it's a great day out to visit the Lone Pine Sanctuary in Brisbane. Always good to support places like this to help the wildlife especially at the moment with such devastation going on",
          "Lone Pine is brilliant, nice and local so perfect for the annual pass and then able to head in and out as we please. Animals on offer are great, and the shows were informative. Keep up the brilliant work!",
          "Great place to take OS visitors...so many koalas, kangaroos and we were lucky enough to see the keepers feeding the platypus, a treat for my visitors",
          "If you are planning a whole day to see this place its not necessary because its small. They do charge extra to get pictures with the Koalas and let you hold them for only a short time. This is a good place to see Koalas interact with each other and watch how they go crazy for",
          "As a couple I thought it was well worth the money for a good few hours of getting to be up close with various animals. Yes the queue of touching a koala is long but it goes fast the only thing for me was we went a few days ago and the women holding the koala has such a face on",
          "Really enjoyed our visit. Lots of families having an enjoyable time. Easy to get around and food wasn\u2019t too pricey. Loved patting the koala. Only complaint is that water stations are needed.",
          "We were surprised Lone Pine Koala sanctuary had so many other native Australian species but the platypus was definitely a highlight besides the kangaroos and koalas. The free-range area where you can hand feed kangaroos and wallabies is really cool and definitely worth spending",
          "This is a great way to spend two or three hours... whether you are a child or an old guy like me. For an extra $25 you can hold a koala, but feeding the kangaroos and wallabies is part of the admission price. As a visitor I was able to buy my ticket at the airport train station.",
          "This is a 20 minute Uber ride or you can take the boat to the sanctuary. If I had the time, I would have taken the boat. I would highly recommend getting there 10-15 min. prior to when they open and wait in line. Walk down to the Koala main area and buy tickets (starting at",
          "A lot of Koalas as expected. The queues for photos with Koalas were massive. Not much information on Koalas, expected a lot more of an information centre, didn\u2019t see any baby Koalas. If you\u2019ve been to Australia Zoo wouldn\u2019t bother with this, kids were more interested in the",
          "Lone Pine is situated at Fig Tree Pocket, approximately 10 minutes from the City. Here is where you will find lots of Koala's to cuddle and get a picture taken with them. There are also other animals including the one we like the working dogs rounding up the sheep. These dogs",
          "Lone Pine is on the edge of Brisbane city. Public transport bus even goes past the reserve. You can see and hold Koala bears, feed kangaroos and watch sheep dogs at work and see many Australian animal in open areas. Food and drinks are available.",
          "I loved how the staff were so passionate about Koala Preservation & their dedication to protecting the Koala Species. I went to one of the talks in the research building to hear all about Koalas and it was great to speak to one of the experts afterwards. The Sanctuary feels very",
          "My wife and I visited but should point out we did not hold the koala\u2019s as we both agreed that seemed a little unfair on the bears. I would say however that this is a lovely park with plenty of animals on show and you can get close to a number of the big animals you want to see",
          "I caught the Miramar fast cruise to Lone Pine and that was a most enjoyable trip. Overall I enjoyed the koala sanctuary, however there was not as much animal interaction as I had hoped and everything costs extra. I knew that going in, but still I was a little disappointed at the",
          "Had an fun day at the sanctuary with the family, feeding the young kangaroos was hilarious and by our visit the park raises money to rescue as rehabilitate abused or hurt animals. Good job guys",
          "This was such a great trip, we were in Australia for two weeks and it really finished off the holiday on a high, it\u2019s too small for an all day visit however there\u2019s plenty to see, make sure you check out the shows and demonstrations esp the birds of prey and the $2 kangaroo feed",
          "We took the Platinum Tour, and it was quite an action-packed day! It seemed to us that each tour varies a bit in terms of what you to in between the major attractions, like holding a koala, and it probably varies based on what needs to be done around the sanctuary. For",
          "Great place with loads to do. I bought a ticket in the morning for \u201chold a koala\u201d Scheduled for the afternoon. When it came to it there was an enormous queue and I waited for over an hour. If I could have got a refund on my ticket I would have. I absolutely understand why time",
          "Great place to see the Koalas, Platypus and Kangaroos. For an extra fee you get a photo of you holding a Koala. Bus ride from the city center drops you off right by the door.",
          "Very good service. We enjoyed the ride and the visit of lone pine. Very welcoming staff. Do not hesitate to take the boat to lone pine and enjoy the river landscape.",
          "Picked by our cruise line. I can imagine it\u2019s more crowded than one would like at certain times. Do the Koala experience with photos-well worth it. Luncheon service looked good. Feeding kangaroos was a bust-just take some pictures. The zoo is limited. Go to birds of prey live",
          "This is a great place to visit if you want to meet the natives. Lots of koalas and kangaroos. You can get there by catching a local bus number 445 and only costs 6 dollars.",
          "This is the place to go to learn about a wide array of wildlife in Australia. It has a large number of Koalas and you can get your picture taken holding one for a $25 donation.",
          "A wonderful way to get up close to Australia\u2019s unique wildlife especially when they are so endangered",
          "You get to sit with the kangeroos, what more do you need. A great little place. We visited when we arrived in Brisbane and we were not disappoited. It was an extremly hot day so most of th animals were hiding from the sun and too hot and bothred to be fed, but we sat with the",
          "Very pretty zoo, and of good size, there are tons to see, and very close to town. The day we went no shows were happening but i am pretty sure there are some happening usually. Take some comfy shoes and make sure to buy kangaroo food before visiting them if you want them to",
          "A really fun place for kids (and adults!) to visit. Feed the kangaroos, cuddle a koala. A perfect introduction to iconic Australian animals.",
          "It doesn't matter if you are child or adult , you will fall in love with little beautiful an amazing koalas hugging their mothers. You can visit almost all kind of local species in one place",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I started off our honeymoon in Brisbane and the only reason we flew into Brisbane from Boston was to experience Lone Pine Sanctuary and trust me, it did not disappoint. We purchased the Diamond Tour which I highly highly recommend, and spent 6 hours interacting and",
          "We visited Lone Pine on our own. We took a Uber back to the place where we were staying. Lone Pine was awesome. You can touch the koalas for free. Just get in line early. We also touched and fed the kangaroos. So much to see and experience here. Highlight of trip.",
          "We spent several hours petting koalas, emus and kangaroos and learning about various species of Australian wildlife",
          "Up close to 130 koalas hanging out in eucalyptus laden posts and branches. Very cute. Platypus, birds, kangaroos, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, frogs, wombats, bats, farm animals, dingoes... lots of weird and wonderful native Australian critters. I enjoyed seeing them all. I was",
          "The sanctuary is filled with koalas and kangaroos. You can pet the kangaroos and feed them with food bought on premise. You can pay extra to have a koalA experience such as holding them but book in advance as it sells out",
          "We visited the Sanctuary with relos from the UK in 2019. It is 10 yrs since we first visited the Sanctuary to find the only thing that had changed was the volume of people going through the turnstiles We counted 10 coaches in the car park plus a full car park. The cages for the",
          "Our friend from the states who is staying with us for a while. Wanted to see the koalas \ud83d\udc28 & this was a great place to see the dreamers as cute as they are beautiful. She loved it we had a great time .",
          "We stayed 3 nights in Brisbane. Looked at packages to visit here, but decided just to use the local bus. We had a great time, seeing the koala bears and the kangaroos up close. No problem queuing to get in, but queuing to get back on the bus was a bit of a shambles.",
          "To start when we arrived on the bus (infrequent) we waited in a long queue which split into further queues and moved very slow. The staff were trying to get people in. $1 for a map! The sanctuary itself contained quite a few small koalas some could be photographed for free",
          "If you are looking for a great place to see Koala\u2019s, this is it! Location is not far from Brisbane main city and staff are friendly. Very busy on weekends and holidays. You can purchase tickets on line for discount prices. Lots of Koala\u2019s to view. You can get very close to",
          "Lots to see and you can interact with the Kangaroos as well. Well worth a visit to see the animals of the outback!",
          "I absolutely loved being here! I spent all day here.. watching and learning about the koalas.. and holding one was a lifelong dream come true. The keepers and handlers were all very sweet and knowledgeable! I was very impressed w my guide, Megan! The kangaroo walkabout was soo",
          "Visited Lone Pine with 6 children under 8, two of them in prams. It was a fun and educational day out for all the children with something to see for everyone. Plenty of sitting areas to enjoy a packed lunchbox, or you can purchase from the cafe. Lots of walking involved to cover",
          "If you like wild life then this is the place to go. It\u2019s not only about Koalas which are amazing creatures. Watch out for the lizards as they are we\u2019ll camouflaged and are happy to pose for a photo. Tanzanian devils were trying to stay in the shade as we\u2019re the wombats so",
          "It was an enjoyable and fun experience, as we got to touch the koalas for free and take pictures with it. The entrance fee was a fare price. The whole zoo is also very well managed. Highly recommended as one of the top spot especially if you visit Brisbane with little kids.",
          "Really good day out. Only marking it down as cashier overcharged us as two adults and two children instead of a family rate. Cashier in the gift shop did rectify the mistake when we queried it\u2019s but shouldn\u2019t have happened. Site is lovely and animals well cared for.",
          "Very Fun and enjoyable trip. Highly recommended to go early if you want to cuddle the koala. Kangaroo Feeding is also a fun activity.",
          "We went xmas day but obviously limited staff. Great place but would have been nice to hold a Koala. Not the fault of the sanctuary but many rude visitors who break rules and push in. It's a shame someone has to wave their feet into the tasmanian devils would have been",
          "Although the weather wasn't great, the sanctuary was awesome! I didn't think we would see so many different animals. The kangaroo exhibit was unreal. Great experience and amazing time!",
          "We've been to other places in Sydney to see Koalas and kangaroos but Lone Pine koala Sanctuary is by far the best place. For AUD25, you can hold a koala and get your own picture. Or you may touch the koala for free during certain time slots. They're so cute! We spent a few",
          "Our flight to Fiji got cancelled, so we were looking for something to do in Brisbane. The Koala Sanctuary was only a 20 minute drive from our hotel near the airport. There are so many Koalas, but there are plenty of other animals to see also. There was a rapture show, but the",
          "When I knew i was visiting Australia for Christmas, I hoped there would be an opportunity to see some of the native animals. What a wonderful place Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is! The animals all look happy and some can be stroked, so a real \"up close\" experience. I learnt a",
          "Memorable visit amidst koalas, kangaroos and other nature. Well organized sessions. Will recommend for any age.",
          "Amazing experience, a MUST DO if you are anywhere near Brisbane. Koalas everywhere, additional fee to hold a koala. Lots of other exhibits too. They don't advertise the kangaroo experience, it's PHENOMENAL! Kangaroos roaming everywhere, feed them, it is unbelievable. Well run",
          "Lone pine was simply spectacular. We were staying in Brisbane on holiday and decided to go on Christmas Day as it was luckily open. The weather wasnt great and it rained for a lot of the time we were there but we still had the most incredible day. The koala interaction was",
          "Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was a delightful place to spend a leisure day out with the family. It\u2019s not very big but our family spent a good 4 hours there. The photo opportunity with the koalas is not to be missed and there were only 2 sessions each day. We were only allowed to",
          "I was born and bred in Brisbane but have lived overseas for 20+ years now, but whenever I come back to Brisbane I make a point of revisitng Lone Pine. I was with friends this time so we paid extra for the Wild Koala Encounter. There were six of us with a Lone Pine guide talking",
          "Worth a visit. You get to feed the roos and close encounter with koala. Place is not as big as expected. May take only around 3 hours.",
          "Did it all: held a koala. Petted a kangaroo. Drank Australien wine. Typical tourist; loved it. Turned a layover into an adventure",
          "Good for Koala only. Koala are more and other animals were not many. The raptor show was good and many kangaroos feeding was good.",
          "Awful experience. Overpriced and overcrowded. Have been to a few similar places, none nearly as expensive. Long queues, avoid if at all possible. Large selection of koalas in small cages",
          "Great place for everyone. Ideal for locals and tourists. It\u2019s a short trip from the city and takes less time than going to the bigger parks. My favourite is the platypus enclosure as it\u2019s a fish tank so you get to see them ;). Kangaroo enclosure is the best I have seen. Tips are",
          "A great day out. A very well kept zoo with lots of space to mingle with koalas and Roos. Food area is very nice and has reasonable choices for lunch or snack. Thoroughly recommend.",
          "I visited the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary with two friends, and we booked the Behind the Scenes tour. The park is beautiful, and our guide, Megan, provided an amazing look at the animals. We helped prepare food for some birds and the platapus. We got up close with some dingos,",
          "Friends who live in Brisbane took us here as we were visiting from the UK. What a fantastic day we had. So many Australian animals... kangaroos you can feed. Koalas up close. Wombats, dingos, everything was there all in one place. Even met the legend John Barrowman (British",
          "Spent a hot afternoon in shady sanctuary by the Brisbane river. Cool breezes off river while we wander around the animals. Koalas kangaroos, wallabies and lots of birds .",
          "I had a friend from Brasil staying and she wanted to see the local wildlife. Unfortunately it was during a heatwave so the weather was uncomfortable but we still had a great time. Most of the animals were pretty quiet on the day - trying to keep cool - but still we got to see",
          "A great place to spend the day with kids.Lot of native animals. Can watch animal shows (i.e.sheep dog show). Can feed animals.",
          "Flight of the birds very short and they do not tell u at the start that the birds will be eating live rodents in front of u. Also no really gift shop only a general shop.",
          "You can hold a Koala by yourself there, and taking photos with them! Also many lizards were walking on the street, just like theres their home and fear nothing. You can also feed Kangaroos here.",
          "We went to Lone Pine as a shore excursion from the ship. When we got there, we made a beeline for the \"hold the koala\" area, so I could get a picture with a koala. There are also many other animals at Lone Pine such as emus, kangaroos, and wallabys. This is a must see in the",
          "If you visit Brisbane this place should be the number one stop on the list! The cost is $42 for a single person and discounts for families. If you want to hold a koala it cost $25. A bag of food for the kangaroos is $2.. Make sure go to the far end of the field where there is",
          "Worth a 30 minute ride from Brisbane. This sanctuary has a large number of rescued animals including a significant amount of koalas. There are also many open areas where kangaroos run free and bright colored lorakeets congregate regularly. Your visit will support their effort to",
          "My husband and I visited Lone Pine Koala sanctuary on my 50th birthday. I came to Brisbane specifically to visit this sanctuary and the park did not disappoint. All the staff were exceptionally friendly and very knowledgeable of all the animals. It was a dream come true to",
          "Our cruise ship docked for a day in Brisbane and we met friends who took us on a tour of Brisbane and then to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. It was the first time that my husband and I had seen koalas in the flesh and to actually stroke one was such a treat. There was so much",
          "we had a great trip on the Koala express boat to the sanctuary . The staff are knowledgable and friendly and I really felt they put the animals first . I saw a platapus for the first time ever and baby dingos !!",
          "The setting of Lone Pine is truly gorgeous, and it features many koalas which you can get quite close to. But as we were told by a member of staff, Lone Pine doesn\u2019t actually take in any koalas from the wild for rescue / rehab - but breeds them on site. This makes the place a",
          "This Sanctuary, to us, seemed really well run. Lots of animals, many endangered, could be seen. Entry tickets are fairly priced. You can hold a koala if you want (extra $25/30) and are willing to queue a bit - that experience was really well-managed I thought, with a fast-moving",
          "We got there as soon as the rain started to fall. But there is a nice waiting area outside with usb charging ports and wicker chairs that was covered so we were able to stay dry. Once inside the park, we were sad to find we had gotten there too late to hold the Koalas. But we",
          "Loved it. But; it wasn\u2019t a cheap day. Admission was about AUD40/pax; a small bag of kangaroo food (to feed the Roos) was AUD2; food and drink in the cafe was expensive as were souvenirs. Having said that; enjoyed every minute of it. Took the bus there from South Brisbane; catch",
          "First of all, I always read the bad reviews first, and I found much complaints about the pictures taken with the koalas, but had you had a \u201cback scene\u201d tour they would have understood why. We took the Adult Sanctuary Experience which cost $310.00 Australian ($209.00 US). Now",
          "If you want to get up close and personal with a Koala, Lone Pine is definitely worth a visit. Get there when it opens to avoid queues to hold and have a picture taken with one, the staff will take some on your phone too as well as a professional one which we really appreciated.",
          "I took two young German backpackers to the Lone PIne Sanctuary because they especially wanted to see Australian animals. It was their first outing on arrival in Brisbane. Of special interest to them and to me was the platypus foraging in the water under conditions.of darkness.",
          "So many koalas and kangaroos!! It felt like it's own kind of heaven (if heaven smelled a little like animal poop). All the koalas were so cute and I waited in line to hold one. Then the kangaroo feeding park was so much fun. Loved that you could spend as much or as little time",
          "This is one of the cutest places on earth. Koalas so close to see and even take a photo for a charge. Make sure you get in queue well time in advance as can be limited numbers. Also other interesting animals to see and the park itself is beautiful. Spent around 3 hours and loved",
          "We had a lovely morning here. It's not a huge park so you won't want to spend all day here but its perfect for a morning or afternoon. The animals are really well looked after and the zookeepers are friendly. We paid extra to hold a koala which was a great experience and we",
          "A good trip out along the river for the whole family. Cuddle a Koala, more the cuddly Koala than us and of course you have to feed the Kangeroo. Don't you? Nice relaxing trip some walking is a nesseccesity.",
          "Free entry and plenty of parking at a nice park setting. Good way to see koalas! Educational self tour",
          "Really well set up, in a lovely setting by the river. A good variety of animals, the Platypus was my favourite, that kept the whole family entertained. We will return soon.",
          "We got off the plane from Vancouver and went straight to Lone Pine. We enjoyed the bird show, feeding the kangaroos and looking at all the beautiful animals they have there. My only recommendation would be to buy a ticket for a photo with a koala as soon as you get in. We",
          "We got the Mirimar cruise to the Sanctuary which was lovely as we got to do some sightseeing at the same time. The sanctuary was lovely, and there are lots of chances to learn about the animals as well as stroke/hold Koalas and feed kangaroos. If you want to hold a koala go",
          "We went on the Miramar cruise to the sanctuary and wondered if 3 hours would be enough but it was just right for us. On entering the parking everything was well signposted. The kangeroo enclosure was our favourite as they were all so tame and following buying some kangeroo",
          "Coming to Australia for the first time, animal lovers will want to see kangaroos and koalas. This stop checks those boxes, and you even get to pet a kangaroo and take a picture with a koala. There are other variety of animals as well. For me, 2-3 hours was enough to go through",
          "Went to the sanctuary via a metro bus for a fraction of the cost of a ferry. It was an extremely warm day so wanted to come and go when I wanted so was more suited to the bus. I explored all of the sanctuary but was amazed at so many koalas in different areas never ever seen",
          "If you want to spend an exciting day having the chance to touch some kangaroo and hold a lovely koala, this is the place for you. This Sanctuary is looking after several species, including birds and some reptiles. Highly recommended.",
          "If you need a full Koala experience. This is the place. You learn about them, you can pat one or even have your picture taken with them. Walk around and join in the talks about Raptor\u2019s or sheep herding, and enjoy all that Lone Pine has to offer. We took a cruise up the river to",
          "As I was in Brisbane on a business trip and had a spare day, I visited the Lone Pine Koala sanctuary. I Took the koala express ( 35 minutes on the boat) which was well organised and staff are great. The sanctuary is great, loved holding a koala and feeding/stroking the",
          "Took my visitor from China and she loved it! Taking my overseas visitors there from now on. Such a brilliant introduction to not only our unique wildlife, but also to Australian culture. The staff were very friendly and their animal presentation talks were so informative and",
          "Visited Lone Pine on 15th October 2019 to fulfil a bucket list moment of holding a koala. What a wonderful place, being close up to native Australian animals was just amazing and created some great memories.",
          "Overpriced, quite a small place. To start from, each and every minimum element including a map will cost additional money. The sanctuary does not have irrigation system so you will well feel the drought in QLD. For goats and sheep no a single piece of grass in their paddocks.",
          "The Koala Sanctuary was one of the best animal experiences we've ever enjoyed! The staff here are very attentive toward all the animals and they really look after them. We were very pleased to know that for the koala holding experience, they only let each koala out for half",
          "Our visitors enjoyed the close contact with kangaroos and emus. Highlight was seeing platypuses clearly in their tank.",
          "Spent about 2.5 hours here (excluding photo taking, as I do not believe in man handling these beautiful animals). Park is small and shady with many trees and spots for you to rest. Koala keeper talk was informative, learnt a few new interesting Koala facts! The marsupials look",
          "If you really want to get to know something about the koalas - that's the best place. Go for the private encounter. It's so worth it! One of the best things I've experienced in Australia. Thank you!",
          "An enjoyable afternoon, a couple of hours sufficient with different shows at different times you can fill more time. Oh and the crocodile is real mean",
          "The Sanctuary is definitely worth the trip and it is really Cool to see so many native Australian animals in on location. The Koala experience where my wife held a Koala and received a photo for like 20 AUD was great\u2014and as a bonus, although \u201cextras\u201d couldn\u2019t hold one, the",
          "You wont find this is Britain! Such a magical day at Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Left to wander around at our own pace, taking in all of the wildlife and then we found the kangaroos!!! hand feeding then, hugging them and stroking their young ones. I could have spent all day here.",
          "If you want to see only kangaroos and koalas then it's ok. Otherwise there are very few animals. Not really worth the time and money. Other zoo's like Taroonga in Sydney are much better.",
          "If you are a first time visitor to Australia, like I was, then this is a real treat. You get to see the wildlife close up, the staff are helpful and the layout of the place is excellent. I thought the raptor show was easily the best I've ever seen (included in the entry price).",
          "I was in Brissy for two days, and was looking for something to do or visit. I came across this sanctuary on TripAdvisor. Slightly cheaper if you're lucky. I brought my parents with me and luckily the weather was okay. My parents loved this place! And I did too. We were",
          "I visited Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary two weeks ago and the whole day spent there was wonderful. I had always wanted to hold a koala and to experience this was wonderful. My recommendation would be if you want to hold a koala to get there for when the Sanctuary opens as the queue",
          "If your wanting to visit a place in Brisbane to see Australian wildlife you can do no better than visit the Lone pine Sanctuary, I took my relatives from overseas and they really enjoyed the day, its affordable and entertaining. The setting is perfect, you would not believe your",
          "Had a wonderful time at Lone pine Koala Sanctuary - we were able to meet a Koala and see the bird and Kettle dog shows, while wandering the park and feed some roo's and wallaby's! Loved it, and would recommend!",
          "We enjoyed the vibe of the sanctuary and how it focuses on the koalas health and safety rather than the visitors, which is why it is quite small. The grounds are lovely for family picnics and bbq's but if you are expecting a lot of interactivity, this isn't the place for you.",
          "My friend and I had a lovely time from beginning to end. The river cruise was relaxing and informative. upon arrival at the sanctuary there was ample time to explore everything, plenty of opportunities for photos of koalas, kangaroos (including patting them), emus and other",
          "Visited with two young girls , had the best time . Loads of animals to see up close . Chance to hold a koala or snake. Feed the kangaroos. So worth a visit.",
          "I had visitors over from China. This was there first time in Australia so we had finished our business about 12:30 as they had never seen a Koala or Kangaroo before I took them to Lone Pine. Being so close to the City meant I could get them to there afternoon flight. They LIVED",
          "We highly recommend visiting Lone Pine. You can walk among kangaroos and wallabies; hold a koala; view many Australian wildlife. You can easily spend the whole day here.",
          "We had great time with close encounter with all resident of Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Ver well laid out with very friendly, knowledgeable staff.",
          "A must visit with interstate or especially international friends. A definite highlight for them. The Koalas are adorable! Although the best was being in a field with kangaroos. We petted them & hugged them!",
          "My partner and I took my partner's 5 year old grandson to Lone Pine for the day during school holidays. We drove there and found good parking. It was easy to navigate around the various displays, which showed a good variey of native Australian animals. The lines to hold or have",
          "Took our 2yearold granddaughter to this Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and although it was raining we had a fantastic time seeing all the Koalas",
          "It was like a dream becoming reality. So many koala\u2019s in one place is unbelievably for Europeans like us. The animals are very well taken care of and it was one of the best koala experiences in Queensland, in our opinion. The koala photo experience was also very enjoyable. The",
          "Nice place to touch the Koala and Kangaroos. We love the Koala`s they are so sweet. Pet the Kangaroos and see lots of other animals who life in the wild. Go, see amazing birds and the show with the eagels its great!!",
          "Koalas kangaroos and Australian animals including snakes within 7 - 8 KMs from Brisbane City. The bird and sheep dog shows are great and prices quite reasonable. Excellent for very young and older children. Plenty of rest rooms and great cafe to boot. There are a fair few local",
          "I went with Mirimar cruises and it was such a great experience. I highly recommend going on the boat tour to Lone Pine. The sights are amazing and breeze was great. Mind you that the line to get a picture with Koalas can be quite long. Also, make sure you get the right link to",
          "Lone Pine is amazing. You get to cuddle a koala and feed kangaroos. But I recommend feeding the goats in the barn area as well (they are always hungry) They have improved the sanctuary with new signs and upgraded many of the enclosures and they were building new stuff as we were",
          "If you are tight on time and want to see a good selection of unique Australian animals, including marsupials, birds, reptiles and monotremes in the one overall location with not too much difficulty and fuss, then Lone Pine is a possible answer. Easy enough to drive to with",
          "We had a great morning there. The price of $100.00 to enter plus$100. for photos with holding a Koala. Got to see other animals we don't see in NZ. Cost about $36.00 for taxi one way. Money wise for 4 people it was worth it.",
          "A great place to bring visitors. They can feed the kangaroos, hold a koala, watch a birds of prey show, and have a great outdoor Australian experience. Love this place.",
          "We went early morning when the animals were active before the heat of the day makes the animals drowsy. It was lovely to see the kangaroos roaming about & you can feed them if you wish, it was a great experience and my guest loved the Koalas",
          "this was our first trip to Lone Pine with our 2yo granddaughter it it was a great day with plenty to keep young and old occupied make sure your there for the morning bird feed followed by the birds of prey and farm yard nursery then take your time to walk the rest of the",
          "Knowing that I may not make it back to Australia, I decided to purchase a behind the scenes Sanctuary Highlights tour for the 4 people in our group, 2 of which live in Brisbane. We all enjoyed it and highly recommend as it is well worth the extra money. It includes admission,",
          "We took the grandchildren for a day out. Easy to manage a pram though it was difficult to see many of the animals from it. Great range of Australian animals to see. Youngest loved to feed and touch the free range kangaroos. They enjoyed the bird show as well as the sheep dog.",
          "Visited the sanctity to see some Australian wildlife and it exceeded our expectations. It\u2019s not a huge place and can be done in 1/2 day trip. Staff are friendly and informative. Koalas and kangaroo are plentiful.",
          "We love this place. Lots of koalas and kangaroos that you can get up close to. The place has a relaxed vibe that makes you feel at ease.",
          "We loved our visit at the sanctuary! We saw plenty of koala and even got to pet the kangaroos. Good variety of animal! Worth the drive",
          "This place is simply the best. We\u2019ve never seen so many well cared for koalas and other animals in one place. All animals are healthy and active. Recommend this place for a day trip.",
          "To get there I used the package with MirimarII 1000 am sailing upriver from Brisbane on a 75 minute voyage passing wonderful riverbank houses to the Sanctuary,They provide a great commentary on everything you see on this cruise. When you get off the boat at the Sanctuary Pier",
          "Visited lone pine with a friend. Reasonably priced. Had a nice walk around. Everything we\u2019ll sign posted. Great place for a photo with Koalas and Kangaroos for the general tourist! Think the photo with koalas was around $25.",
          "Liked this park. And if you haven\u2019t seen koalas before, then you are in for a special treat. They also cute kangaroos. Not ,any, but we found them and hand fed them. Cute.",
          "Our family took the Sanctuary Highlights Tour in September, and it was one of the highlights of our whole Australia trip. Megan was a wonderful guide, knowledgable and always hustling ahead to smooth out every step or our adventure. We all have fabulous professional pictures",
          "Took a bus from the city, only 30 minutes. Well worth the visit, even for a middle aged couple!!. Great to get up close to an array of indigenous Australian animals. Informative and fun day. The only draw back were the ques to have pics taken with the Koalas were lengthy.",
          "Our first visit was nearly 10 years ago. So we wanted to go again, we are glad we did. Lots to see and do, take in the 'bird show' and the 'shep dog show'. Relax at the food area. Overall a very enjoyable few hours spent here.",
          "Beautiful sanctuary for the animals. Lots of photo opportunities for those who haven't seen any koalas, kangaroos and dingos.",
          "Although it is pricy to get in, with additional prices once inside to hold koalas, the experience was definitely worth it. Staff were very nice and friendly and seems like they treat their animals well and care about their well being as well as customer enjoyment. You can spend",
          "Still a great visit, but not easy with an elderly woman. The kids had a great time but if it were a bit more interactive we would have enjoyed it more. Personally I loved it but the kids weren't as interested as I had hoped.",
          "This is not a zoo; it is a sanctuary for Australian animals that cannot be taken back to the wild. Lots of animals including foxbats, wombats, platipus and yes, koalas and kangaroos. W\u00eeorth going again and again.",
          "Had a great time visiting Lone Pine with my family and especially my auntie has never seen koala & kangaroo so that was a great day!",
          "Masses of space for children to run around freely amongst animals and not be aware they are in the middle of the city Marvellous venue for overseas guests to appreciate and be up close and personal with Australian wildlife Ideal for families as it is easy to bring your own",
          "We spent a couple of hours here today and it was a lot of fun. The sanctuary was set up well and had lots of seating areas. There seemed to be a lot of things for kids to do and good interactive areas. I liked watching the raptor birds of prey demostration. I will be coming back",
          "We went to Lone Pine with a free bus from our hostel, Bunk. It was a small group and a nice way to meet peaople too. The animals are well looked after and they offer Koala photos for a price. These should be included in the price i think. Overall we loved our day at Lone PIne!",
          "This was BY FAR the best zoo I have ever been to. The animals are super active and the way they have set it up allows you to see everything very well. There are no screens or windows blocking the koalas, so you feel like you are actually with them versus it being a cage. The",
          "Adult or child it doesn't matter, it's a really enjoyable day. Established in 1927 it is the world's first koala sanctuary. Easy to walk around, cuddle a koala have your photo taken (this is very popular so you may have to wait a while), pat and feed the many kangaroos or",
          "This is a great place to spend about 3 hours unless you have kids with you. Definitely a must to take a picture hugging the Koala. Also if you can rather take the Ferry going it would be great, thoroughly enjoy the commentary along the way. This is a definite must see when going",
          "Lots of sleepy koalas and very greedy kangaroos This is a great place to bring overseas visitors for d closeup with some of Australia\u2019s iconic wildlife Hand feed an emu or a kangaroo, have your photograph taken with a koala",
          "Lovely to see Kolas they were looked very content & had an opportunity to get up close to kangaroos also",
          "Super day out. We had not seen any koalas on our trip, so this was very exciting to visit and we enjoyed our visit very much. The boat ride was also very easy from the cbd...well southbank area. Payment was also very easy.",
          "Took the lonely pines boat tour up to the sanctuary. The boat takes about 90 minutes each way and the commentary on the way to the sanctuary gives a great account of Brisbane\u2019s history and is very interesting. Once at the sanctuary there was plenty of animals to see. The",
          "Lone Pine is a good outdoor event that is educational and entertaining. Small and older children can enjoy seeing and interacting with some of our native and domestic animals. Every time we visit we learn something new. Good areas to buy a meal or bring your own picnic lunch",
          "Travelled here by bus from bus station which costs around $11 each way for 2 people, it\u2019s takes about 45 minutes. We spent a nice couple of hours here. Very calm and enjoyable. The koalas are beautiful and well cared for. The children that were visiting we\u2019re all very well",
          "The kids had a great time there and we enjoyed it too. They really do a great service to these animals. Lovely place",
          "I went on this trip with Miramar Cruises and had a package deal of boat + entry to the park. The cruise to and from the park was as enjoyable as the sanctuary itself and really added to my knowledge about Brisbane. Many people are keen to get a photo of them holding a Koala -",
          "Its main thing is the koalas. But there is plenty to see about Australian animals. Having 2 young kids they both enjoyed the day loved it all. You can pay and feed kangaroos and emus. They have a kiosk for food. You can bring your own if needed. A fun day out.",
          "Came here in a Monday and it does feel like a popular place with many groups of school children and tourist alike. The animals seem well take care. The Roos are not all hungry for food especially those alone by themselves so we went to find those Roos in big groups . Easily",
          "We traveled on the Mirramar II, up the Brisbane river, to the sanctuary. We listened to the informative narrative on the way and had a nice coffee and fresh scones for morning tea, as we critiqued the style and design of the mansions along the river! The boat was comfortable and",
          "We took the Mirimar Koala Express cruise boat to the koala sanctuary which took about 40 min from south Brisbane. The cost included return boat fare and entrance into the park. We easily booked online. Soooo many koala bears you won\u2019t be disappointed with the opportunity to",
          "This is a privately owned little zoo a 40 min bus ride away from the CBD. A lot of groups are brought to the sanctuary. Nice to take your kids, but although interesting for adults. The main attraction are the koalas. They have their special places with tree stumps decorated with",
          "My husband and I took our American friend who was visiting Brisbane for the weekend. The visit to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was a wonderful place to show off a wide variety of Australian animals and birds, with the opportunity to feed and pet some of them. We also attended",
          "As an American I would call this a zoo, but from the name I expected mostly koalas, but it\u2019s much more. So many unique animals to Australia that we don\u2019t see in the US. We didn\u2019t get a picture with a koala, but that seemed pretty popular. The koalas were very close in their",
          "On our first full day in Australia, our visit here gave us a great introduction and appreciation for the animals of Australia, which are very different than those native to the US. Have been to many zoos, but had never seen a cassowary, wombat, platypus, or Tasmanian devil",
          "The park was just the right size, not too big and not too small. Better to go there when it's just opened in the morning to avoid large crowds and long queues to take pics with the koala.",
          "You can go to this place and experince about the wild life in Australia. You can feed Kangaroos and even hold a Koala in your hands - Entry ticket of 40$.",
          "What an amazing place. My first trip to Australia and I got to cuddle a koala. The staff were friendly and explained all about their animals. The whole park was interesting.",
          "Had a friend visit from overseas so this was one of the sites we decided to go to as they have a variety of animals to see. We arrived about 30 mins before the 11-11.30AM FREE 'Meet a Koala' activity so went over and lined up. Here you can get up close but NOT hold the Koala.",
          "We took a cruise down the Brisbane river and arrived at the jetty to the sanctuary. There were several steep steps to the entrance but were warmly greeted by one of the staff members. We were given a map and advised of the talk times if we were interested. We bought some",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by Lone Pine. After reading a lot on the forums between Australia Zoo, Currumbin and Lone Pine we thought it best and easiest to go here from our hotel in Brisbane to be able to see some of the Australian wildlife. We took an Uber there and it was",
          "A great way to get up close with marsupials on Brisbane and a good use of half a day (we could have spent longer). Lots of koalas with many awake and both wallabies and roos in an open enclosure. Unusually for these sort of be venues food and drink was reasonably priced. Busy",
          "We found lone pine to be an amazing day out. We took the bus from Queen street, the cheapest way to get there. A great value day out with a family ticket costing $88. You can get up close with the koalas and the kangaroos in fact with most of the animals during the day. Our",
          "Our family visited this sanctuary and we were so glad that we did. We purchased a day pass and we were able to attend various demonstrations and shows involving herding dogs and birds of prey. The sanctuary is easy to navigate although there are areas with steps. The high point",
          "Tickets: Can be purchase online, at the counter, or via kiosk. Really simple and accepts Visa/MasterCard. Price: The price is a little expensive when compared to other zoos in the Pacific; however, it\u2019s not unreasonable. Entertainment: I really enjoyed the sanctuary.",
          "My trip to Brisbane was kind of spontaneous and unplanned, just so I could visit this Sanctuary. It was absolutely worth it! For those of you buying bus tickets to get to the sanctuary on your own, you can pay cash on the bus. Don't make the mistake I did of trying to buy round",
          "After buying a day pass you are expected to cough up more money if you want to hug a koala. However, if you wish to do this you may as well throw your ticket in the bin as you won't get to do any of the other activities in the sanctuary. This is because you cannot book a time",
          "Same as the other Koala parks that are all up the coast. Only this one was more expensive than the rest.. You can see the Koala, pet Kangaroos and all sorts of other Aussie animals. For $20 get a photo with a whole range of animals. There are better parks with less crowds and",
          "I went here quite a while ago, the trip was amazing. The bushwalks were nice and relaxing. I would go there again. The trip was a great day.",
          "Very nice place to visit to see Koala's and Kangaroos. There is a long wait to have your picture taken with the Koalas so plan accordingly. Very cool demonstration of herding dogs working sheep. Don't miss it.",
          "We saw a number of Australian animals in a small set up. The close encounter withe the koalas was unique. Imagine holding this so sweet animal in your arms while a picture (later translated in a calendar) is taken by a profesionnal. Come early as grline ups forms quickly",
          "I didn\u2019t know what to expect in terms of crowds and how touristy it would be. I took the bus from central station at 8:45am and I was there at 9:30am. I had purchased my ticket at the tourist office on Queen street downtown (at a discount) plus I avoided the small queue at the",
          "Lone pine has expanded over the years - the koala habitat is great, with care for the animals, the expansive area for Roos and wallabies is great. The raptor show was less exciting and the birds seemed pretty tattered. Staff great, store needs cleaning up and upgrading.",
          "Very nice, friendly staff with good and detail explanation.We had a Koala hugging tour, hugging time is a little short but overall was good.",
          "We absolutely loved our trip to Lone Pine and cannot speak highly enough re the staff and our whole experience there. I feel I should start by defending the park a little from the people who have complained re the lines for holding the koala . We went independently of any",
          "Came on the miramar excursion. Told had 3 hours in the park before the boat back. Advised to go straight to koala photo station as there would only be one session to hold a koala. We bought the tickets and had to wait 3o minutes for the session to start. There were different",
          "Best place to visit in SE Qeensland if you are looking for somwhere to see the animals of Australia just love amazing. I visit annually and its always a super day this time we took our children grandchildren and visitors from the uk and loved every minute of getting up close and",
          "Had a wonderful time with the family here. Getting the chance to cuddle a koala was of course the highlight, bu there is plenty more there to whet the appetite. And taking a break for a coffee with koalas all around us was really special.",
          "After going to Featherdale Wildlife Park outside of Sydney, we were underwhelmed by this park. The kangaroos were a bit dirty, were quite lazy and subdued, especially compared to the kangaroos at Featherdale and the Australia Zoo, so I hope there wasn\u2019t anything skeptical in",
          "Brilliant place to visit. See all the Australian animals up close and in one place. Get there early ie opening time if you want to be sure of a Koala photo.",
          "I personally enjoyed seeing the kangaroo and koala because that what I came for . Nothing else special about the place but it\u2019s still not bad for me as a tourist",
          "A beautiful location with a great set of exhibits. Koalas galore and our three year old absolutely loved it. Some good informative talks/shows too.",
          "Really relaxed and peaceful area to chill out in and see some gorgeous Aussie animals! I really enjoyed the birds of prey show, and also seeing the wombat and dingo. But of course all were awesome to see!. The cafe was reasonably priced, as was the souvenirs!",
          "We spent about 3 hrs watching the demonstrations, visiting the animals including koalas (they've about 100), wallabies and kangaroo, wombats, Tasmania devil, emu and all sorts of birds and reptiles. The park was well layout and easy to walk through. The animal living areas are",
          "First time for me to see so many koalas, not just sleeping, but also interacting with visitors - playing with each other, climbing the tree chunks, eating, jumping up and down. They are so different - active and happy. Watching them and taking photos for (with) them made you",
          "Had a great time here with my family. The oldest even got to hold a koala for a family picture (extra cost). The kids loved it and it loved being able to pet all of the different animals.",
          "Amazing. Such a beautiful place. A great selection of native Australian Animals, reptiles and birds. My fave were the wombats. Great wee gift shop and fantastic enclosures and keepers. Totally worth a visit and so close to the centre of Brisbane",
          "Great day out cruising with good commentary from crew. Koala like you would never see before, no looking skyward just out to arms length. Wonderful and lots of groups but no feeling of being in a crowd.",
          "Yes, most of us locals send our out of town guests there. However, it is worth immersing yourself with the local wildlife every now and again to remeber all the animals that should be around us.",
          "We visited Lone Pine last week. It was like going back in time ... because everything was the same! Come on Lone Pine! Spend some of that money that you're raking in with all those tourists to put some railings in that the children can see through or at least some little steps",
          "Had a great day out with the family. Had a picture holding a Koala. Feed the Kangaroos and Emus. So much to see n do",
          "Lovely place plenty of koalas to go round love how they look after them as they cannot be re relases but teach ing the public the importance of australias wild life. I would recommend this place for all family fun that sits in brisbane its self well done lone pine .",
          "I have a teenager that LOVES kangaroos and koalas so this was a must. We were a bit worried it would be more zoo than sanctuary but they do seem to be keen on conservation and care about the animals. Great to wander around and be able to see kangaroos and feed them. They have a",
          "The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is a must see! First things first, buy your tickets before you get there for a discount. If you buy the tickets online it's 38 dollars instead of 42. But if you buy tickets at the Tourist Information Center in the CBD are only 34 dollars. Once you",
          "A must see trip . The sanctuary is incredible and their work is invaluable. Got incredibly close to the Koalas and fed the kangaroos ( a great selfie opportunity)",
          "Everywhere I read about this place so I thought it was a must go in Brisbane. But it really is a small zoo where you can be around the kangaroos that\u2019s nice. There are some other animals and you can meet the koal up close. If you pay and wait in line you can take a photo with a",
          "We took the boat from the Cultural Centre so we had a relaxing boat ride to the Sanctuary. The taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong place, so we had quite a walk to the boat, but they held it for us. The sanctuary itself was beautiful. Koalas, wombats, etc, and I was able",
          "This place is fantastic. Holding a koala was amazing! All the work they do to protect them. Not just koala's here Kangaroos, wallabies, sheep dog shows, raptor show was so great as well. Do yourself and check this place out. Support a great project!",
          "Took some students on an exchange tour to Lone Pine over the weekend for 4 hours visit, absolutely great experience. So many koalas and quite active ones too, the kids are very excited. The sheep dog herding show and the raptor birds show are both good and bird feeding in the",
          "Held a koala! Pet an emu! Fed kangaroos and wallabies!! It was surely a visit we will never forget!! We got to see a platypus! All the animals we were looking forward to seeing in one place.",
          "We decided to do the boat trip excursion from Brisbane South Bank to get to the sanctuary which was so worth doing for all the extra things you saw on the journey there - we then decided to stay longer than the tour so got the bus back into the city! The sanctuary is fantastic.",
          "I have a wide range of kids from 25 yrs to 14 yrs. Everyone enjoyed the day seeing all the unusual animals from Tasmaninan Devil, platypus, koala, wild lorakeet, sheep dogs, and kangaroos. The highlight of the day was watching a baby koala emerge from the mother's pouch and",
          "On our bucket list to see and hold a Koala and great surprise to feed the kangaroos. the young adults had a great time. The Lorikeets feeding time was a great treat after a long day. their poo, not so much. Small area to walk, a bit hilly to go back and forth for shows. Still",
          "Its an expensive way to see a few kangaroos and Koalas, the place has seen better days, quite tatty, I agree it looks a lot more like a downmarket zoo than a sanctuary, and know doubt I will get the same old response from them about what it is and what they do, it might help if",
          "The day as a whole was interesting but I found the place now abit aged and enclosures need attention.",
          "Have lived in Brisbane for 30 years and never thought of going here. An old friend visited Australia and wanted to see a koala so we went. Not a big place but quite well laid out. We luckily arrived as a Koala petting session was underway so we got to touch one. Plenty of",
          "Really disappointing, I was imagining a wildlife park but instead it was just like going to a zoo. Koalas in small pens surrounding by noisy tourists, giant queues to hold a koala while they get passed around from person to person. It didnt seem as though the koalas were ones",
          "The koala's are beyond adorable! It was also fun feeding the kangaroos that are so gentle. You can feel their teeth running across your hand as you feed them but there is nothing to worry about. We seen a baby kangaroo joey roll out of its moms pouch it was hilarious! The",
          "We purchased the highlight package and found that it was well worth the money! Kaylee was our guide and did a great job sharing lots of great information. Loved holding a koala, sea eagle and a python - oh and pet kangaroos!! A truly memorable experience.",
          "We took our Family specifically to see Koalas and Kangaroos. Lone Pine Sanctuary you did not disappoint . It was very busy though and the feeding of kangaroos overrated... too many people were feeding them so good bags were a waste. We will be back though.",
          "They do adverts with taking pictures of visitors holding coalas, but only a few people get the chance to do it. They tell it is because of limited exposure time for each coala. At first glance that is a good thing, on second glance it seems a farce when you see stuff cuddling",
          "Great day at the sanctuary.. missed out on holding a koala however this is not staff fault as it was so busy! Was offered a picture to stroke koala instead which made our family day having a family picture.. always have a lush day here!",
          "Great outing, perfect for all ages! Enjoyed the Raptor Show (and learned a lot), feeding the wallabies and kangaroos, petting Ralph the Koala, and seeing lots of baby koalas!",
          "Great deal for students at half the price; thank you. Amazed by the cute koalas, but sad that the lines to touch them were so long, and we would have appreciated a tour. I found the panels besides the animal cages self-explanatory and easy to read. However, the park decided to",
          "This sanctuary has more koalas than any other in Australia. The breeding program is matched by none. Regrettably they can't be released but into the wild because they are being hunted by some for their fur. There's more here than just koalas; they have all of Australia's",
          "Poor lay out, lack of instruction, unhelpful staff. Don't go. We bought tickets online but loads of people just walked in past us with no tickets- so take a chance. We queued twice to hold a koala with a 22month old. Both times the queue was cut off in front of us without",
          "If you are in Brisbane and you are eager to meet specific Australian animals and birds this is the place to visit. Of course this is a great place to meet koalas and to learn about them.",
          "We took 10year old Grandson. He LOVED the Lorikeet feeding. The working sheep dog didn\u2019t hold his attention. The raptors were OK. He enjoyed the chance to pat the free range emu. He laughed at the VERY relaxed Wombat reclining on its back in the Winter sun. We all LOVED viewing",
          "Fantastic staff , fed Roos and saw Koala\u2019s Beautiful setting, a must see well worth a visit Lots to se",
          "I wanted to hold a Koala so bad when I went to Australie. So bad! could not go back without that! Searched and searched and found this amazing place. You want to see a Koala and not just one sleeping at the top of the tree that does not show his cute face? Go to Lone Pine! There",
          "Chose this place as I was heavily pregnant and with young kids. It turned out as a good decision. It was a good and easy half day sighting of the native animals and we also managed to have closer interactions with the koalas and the kangaroos. Good to note that the place is",
          "LOVE! this park. Great set up and you get to see Koalas up so close. Come early and feed the kengurus while they are still interested in the food. The sheep dog show is also really cool.",
          "I was over in Brisbane for my recent birthday; celebrating it with my family. My choice was a Harbour Cruise ot the Lone Pine Sanctuary. What a fabulous birthday it was. Thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a compact area however don't let that fool you into thinking it was cramped or",
          "Incredible, by pass lines, treated like VIP. Best encounter with animals, pictures and details on their care, lifestyle etc. Worth it totally.",
          "Took a cruise to the sanctuary. Booked through TripAdvisor. It was a good trip as my friend and I get to view many koalas and feed kangaroos. Food for the kangaroo can be bought from cafe. The only disappointment is that we could not take a photo with the koala though we waited",
          "This is the place to see koalas close up and if you wish hold and be photographed The sanctuary has a large number of koalas as well as other Australian animals and birds.",
          "It was not like any animal sanctuary we have ever been to. We spent the morning there exploring, oohing over the koalas and facetimed family in the States so they could enjoy the koalas too. My college age daughter left very satisfied and happy. The animals seem well cared for.",
          "This place is so wonderful. They look after all the animals superbly. The koalas are truly wonderful",
          "Took river boat to Lone Pine which was a bit breezy and wet (Raining) but okay..Got to park and it was very crowded with some big tour groups. Sad we didn't get to see much as crowds were to big and not moving. Bird free flight was great but again, couldn't see much. Line up for",
          "This is a must visit place when you are in Brisbane.... We got there from central of Brisbane and the taxi ride took about 30mins... reached there and it'a self-purchase kiosk for tickets... and then when you walk in thru the souvenior ship, the staff will then checked your",
          "Lovely sanctuary. Staff is in love with koalas .such adorable creatures and well taken care off. We can actually feed kangaroos with our own hands.They just eat food straight from our palms such adorable sights. Thr food is provided just outside the meeting area.Emu roam around",
          "Have not been for many years and the transformation is amazing. It is a fantastic sanctuary to visit. They have not only Koals but kangaroos, snakes,crocodiles, wombats, Tasmanian devil, lizards, many species of native birds, bats and the most amazingly active platypus! The",
          "This business is a poor excuse for a sanctuary. The animals were kept in small enclosures, including the Koalas, which were man handled by many tourists during the day. Also it seems these animals will never be released into the wild which begs the question: what is the function",
          "Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was the main event for my trip to Brisbane, and I was NOT disappointed! I purchased the VIP package, so I had the opportunity to hold a Koala (seriously awesome!!) and enjoyed time petting the Kangaroos. The grounds were constantly and consistently",
          "This is a lovely little sanctuary with lovely open wide spaces, animals all look relaxed and healthy. Enjoyed the openness and quiet peace of just wandering around, seeing the animals, interacting with the kangaroos. A highlight was seeing the sweetest little mum with her joey",
          "Fun with Kangaroo and Koala. The only minus is the photographer is below my expectation. I love the coffee at the bus stop!",
          "Small centre, but easy to get to from Brisbane. Great to see koalas for us non-aussies! Take a picnic.",
          "This was the biggest reason for my trip to Australia and it did not disappoint. I've always loved koalas (and Australian wildlife in general), and I knew this would be the best place for me to see them. I was especially fortunate in that I was the only person to book the",
          "Excellent tour if you are looking for koalas and kangaroo petting and close pictures. Whole tour can take 2 hours. Make sure to check times for Koala pictures if you want to take pictures with koala. Excellent family activity",
          "I came here in March with a friend from Japan, it was my first time at this sacntuary and I was really impressed at its layout, expanse and animals on display. You had to pay to hold the Koalas but it was well worth it and the staff are really sensitive to the Koalas needs only",
          "Located very close to Brisbane, this really is a Sanctuary. Heaps of animals to see. Great photo opportunities and even a chance to hold a koala (cost applies, but very reasonable)",
          "This was absolutely my favorite thing to do so far. The Kangaroos are very accessible and enjoy laying around and being fed the food pellets you can purchase at the concession store. Kangaroos loved being petted and scratched. The Koalas are very visible but you must pay to do a",
          "We decided to go and see the koalas and kangaroos whilst staying nearby. We arrived around midday so after a beverage we headed over to the meet and greet a koala. We joined a short queue to stand next to a keeper and stroke the koala s back for a photo opportunity which was",
          "I would highly recommend this place for solo travellers/couples and family- everyone !! It's amazing how close you can get to kangaroos and koalas. Loved it!",
          "This is by far the best place to visit if you're coming to the Brisbane in Australia, especially considering the price 76AUD for a family of two adults and 3 kids, you will see a tons of Koalas resting on the trees, sleeping, awake, eating, tons of opportunities. If you have",
          "One of the best parks I have seen.So many cute Koalas. Loved it would highly recommend it.Also the bird show was great too.",
          "Came here in June & loved it so much we bought annual passes! The koalas are always awesome to watch & cuddle but we also got a lot out of the shows as well as wandering around the beautiful grounds. A must do if visiting Brisbane & we will encourage any family/friends who visit",
          "Lone Pine has a really good collection of animals, in a scenic location which is located reasonably close to the city. The two stand-out positives were the sheer quantity of Koala enclosures (they are spotted all around the park), so you could always get a great view of them.",
          "Absolutely lovely place. Loads of koalas and other animals. Expensive to eat in the restaurant and gift shop was pricey. Nice place to visit with the family.",
          "If you want to see koalas, this is the place to be ! Nice park, very interesting things to learn about Australian wildlife :)",
          "We have visited many koala sanctuaries throughout Australia, and the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is our favorite! You can get up close to them and you even have the opportunity to hold one for a photo. We also enjoyed hand feeding the kangaroos. There are so many friendly",
          "Good family friendly zoo, loads and loads of koalas and opportunities to hold and photograph. Hand feed kangaroos and then the normal local zoo stuff. We spent about 2 hours there with an 18yr old, easy drive from city- 20 minutes free parking on site. Buy your tickets at the",
          "Visit to Lone Pine Sanctuary on 2nd day after reach Brisbane. We get the entrance ticket at an authorised travel agent.The sanctuary is full of eucalyptus fragrance. Start the tour with bird show, sheep dog show, kangaroo and wallabys feeding, visit Koala and Tasmanian devils.",
          "This was one of the highlight of our trip to Brisbane. I have always been a koala lover and this was place to go. As well as seeing lots and lots of koalas it was impressive what they are doing in research. There are also other animals to see which was fun but have to admit I",
          "The Koala sanctuary has been a highlight of our trip. The kids and young adults in our group loved holding the Koalas (for an extra fee), feeding the Kangaroos, and learing and seeing Raptors and sheep dogs un action. All fees go towards a good cause in care and research for",
          "Featuring Australian iconic Koala bears, the most I have seen gathered in one place. Open concept zoo with many animals which can be touched, fed and stroked, including the tamest and friendliest kangaroos ever seen. Snakes, dingo, chickens, goats, sheep, mustering sheep dogs",
          "I had the best day at the Koala sanctuary!!! I had never seen a kangaroo jumping or hugged a koala until visiting the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. In addition to the amazing experience with the animals, I learnt a lot about them with the various exhibits throughout the",
          "Good area and lots of Koala to see. Also Kangaroo. Especially good to go with children. If you don\u2019t have time to go to the zoo it\u2019s a good place to visit.",
          "The visit to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was one of our favorite days spent in Australia. We got to feed roaming kangaroos, hold a Koala and learn about the Australian wildlife. My husband, who doesn't get excited about a lot, said it was the most fun he had in a long time.",
          "To be able to fully interact with so many Australian animals was phenomenal. From holding and petting koalas and feeding kangaroos and wallabys made for a lovely day!! Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, and truly enjoy sharing their knowledge and animals to the",
          "The Sanctuary is outside Brisbane about 30 minutes. We traveled by Uber. Lone Pine has a large area with free roaming kangaroos. Roo food is sold and you can feed them right out of your hand. It was really fun to roam around this enclosure and be right with the kangaroos.",
          "Wanted to see kangaroos while visiting Australia from the USA. This was outstanding. Got to hand feed and pet kangaroos as well as see koalas and many other animals. Nice sanctuary. The express river boat ride was a bonus. Great time. A must visit if you want to see animals up",
          "If you have no opportunity to be close to koalas or kangaroos this is the best place to have fun for the whole family young or old.Here you can feed kangaroos and have a memorable picture taken holding a cute koala.Your friends back home will surely be thrilled and envious of",
          "What a fun place to Serpens a few hours or more. Easily accessed , clean and such happy, well fed animals! Wonderful morning, well spent.",
          "It\u2019s a zoo for Koalas and other native Australian animals. Much bigger than I expected. I don\u2019t like to see native Australian birds (or any birds for that matter) in enclosure, but especially ones that are quite small and they can\u2019t fly around in. The children quite enjoyed it,",
          "We visited here as part of a tour and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. A large variety of native wildlife can be seen here including the opportunity to feed dozens of kangaroos in a massive enclosed area. Lots of koalas as expected throughout the park and the customary photo",
          "What a. Facinating place to visit when in Brisbane, koala's and an array of Australian animals and lizards, make the visit well worth while.",
          "If you are visiting Brisbane I would recommend a visit, .We went by car but its a bit out of the way in a residential area so I don't know how you would get there by public transport. I would recommend a taxi or an organise tour.",
          "This was well worth the cost of admission, you get to feed the Kangaroos, see a variety of animals and get to hold the Kola's. The photos with the Kola are rightly priced as well.",
          "It was good to have so much in the one place when we visited with Overseas guests. Helped as we had such a short time to show them so much.",
          "Great small zoo where you can see Australian animals right up close. Holding a koala is one of the great experiences of my life.",
          "I have been going with my grandchildren for at least 5 years. Great value with the Annual Pass and free for children under 3. The kids love it and always find something new to see, they are now very aware of all animals Australian. They have been able to touch koalas,",
          "We didn\u2019t really know what to expect and were surprised with the number of koalas penned together but they seemed pretty content. We were happy to be supporting the efforts to protect these bears. But the highlight was the Raptor Show - which is not to be missed. In all a nice",
          "Awesome place to experience a Koala in your very own arms. These very docile creatures seem to enjoy human interaction and it's a treat to see one moving aroundvtheir habitat, which they rarely do. Wallabys and kangaroos abound in a surreal setting as you enter their territory",
          "Best place to see variety of Australian animals, birds, reptiles, etc.. Plan on spending whole day here to get the most out of your visit.",
          "Took the Bus from Brisbane city centre (bus station under the Myer centre). Sanctuary Tickets (slightly cheaper) and sheet with Bus info from the Tourist information office on Queen street on the morning of our visit. Koalas are one of the must do's for any visit to Australia",
          "Overall, we really enjoyed our time at the sanctuary. Although we didn\u2019t hold a koala, being able to watch them in their enclosures as they climbed around and ate eucalyptus was something special. We chose not to pay the extra $25 per person to hold a koala. The line was long,",
          "Bought tickets and joined the queue to hold a koala and get a photo with him (Rory)which was my main reason for visiting this place. A fabulous experience. Get there early as they only allocate a certain amount of tickets to do this. Kangaroos everywhere which you can go up to",
          "It was a sunny Sunday and we decided to celebrate our grandson's second birthday at Lone Pine. From the lovely garden areas, to the large green areas (which suited our very energetic grandson indeed) this was a sanctuary well worth visiting. Many fascinating",
          "We visited the Sanctuary in late-May after taking the River Cruise boat into the Sanctuary. There was so much to do and see at Lone Pine! We saw so many koalas and kangaroos, but also dingoes, emus, and birds! We were fortunate to have our pictures taken with a koala (a hearty",

          "I would have rated the park 5 stars, but for the trip that we had over. We took the koala express which only took 35 minutes, but was probably the coldest 35 mins of my life. We were sat on the front row and were not expecting how cold it was going to get. The afterwards, we",
          "Nice way to experience many animals and up close to the koalas and their young. Can feed and pat the kangaroos of which there are many! Great place. Recommend for tourists visiting Australia who want to experience koalas and kangaroos",

          "This is a must visit when in Brisbane. If I lived in the area, I would hands down buy a annual pass so I can come feed and hanging out with the kangaroos and see the kaolas whenever I want! If you have family - it\u2019s a place to take the kids. I will def come back to bring my",
          "Definitely worth a visit, lovely park which included a boat trip. Can easily feed the kangaroos and had pictures with a koala. Booked in the UK.",

          "Its a great place to visit if first time in Australia. The kangaroos bring lot of joy even for teens, and koalas ofcourse plus all other... and eating under the pictures of celebrities being there give this reassuring feeling, so thumbs up",
          "Very impressed with this place. Nicely laid out with animal wondering free range. Kids loved it. Not overcrowded nor commercialised like a lot of other zoos. Got to pat a koala for free",
          "Never thought I will be able to personally see and interact with Kangaroo. I arrived late afternoon so I was not able to cuddle with koala. I just saw the koala sleeping and it was so cute. \ud83d\ude0d Wanna go back again. Worth the price.",
          "Spent a good four hours here. The place is fantastic. All sorts of animals here including snakes, lizards, emu, kangaroo, wallaby, birds of prey which have a great show. Make sure you don\u2019t miss it. Great fun to feed the roo\u2019s and watch the koalas eating. It\u2019s a must to",
          "We had such an amazing experience at Lone Pine! First, the facility is very clean and well organized. The signage is great and there\u2019s staff everywhere at your service.

          "We took an Uber to the Sanctuary and enjoyed this wildlife experience close to the city. We paid extra to have our photos taken hiding a koala. The bird flight show was very good.",
          "Cute few hours out, could easily make it last a whole if you went to all the talks. We went to the koala talk and the Tasmanian devil talk which were both really interesting. Loved seeing all the animals and getting up close to them! Also super easy to get to from Brisbane city",
          "I was here as part of an international completion and what is more Australian to show to students than a koala sanctuary? We first went to the sheepdog show per our drivers suggestion and it was a great idea, even with teenagers. We got to see how incredibly smart the",
          "If you want to hold a Koala and feed a kangaroo then this is the perfect trip for you. There is a lot to see however it is possible to cover most of the shows that take place on the site within a 3 hour visit. This might sound like a long time, but it flies by quickly. We",
          "we spent a couple of hours in the sanctuary with our 6 year old daughter and enjoyed it a lot! A lot of animals, cuddling koalas, feeding kangaroos and more! Especially the huge kangaroo area is wonderful! Overall the sanctuary is really beautiful and we would definitely go",

          "Spent 1.5 hours looking at the koalas, kangaroos and other animals. If you love koalas, this is the place to visit. Not sure if the rest of animals are hiding/sleeping or what, but only managed to see one Dingo, one wombat, one Tasmanian Devil. Tickets are a little pricey at",
          "A lovely place to visit on the Brisbane river, beautiful animals in a beautiful location, a must visit if you are in Brisbane.",
          "I had been before but my husband hadn't. Not much has changed in the 5 years since I was last there and it didn't fail to delight again. We both enjoyed the cuddling Koala experience and the flight show with the birds. The fact the staff will use your camera and take a photo of",

          "Much to see here,you really get up close and personal, the only disappointment was we were waiting in the Que for s photo with the koala suddenly they just stop said nothing and started doing other work. The rest of the sanctuary was reay good,we had lovely day there",

          "We had 2 Canadian friends with us and Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary afforded a wonderful up close and personal view of great Australian animals. The size of the Sanctuary was much better than the large zoos. It would also be a wonderful place to bring children over and over again.",
          "One of the best kept secrets in Australia. Get up close and personal with Kangaroos, Emus, Koalas, snakes, etc. They also have a good raptor/birds of prey show and a decent sheep herding show (by boarder collies). This is a wonderful place for families. Kids will love it!",
          "Quite a nice change from a large zoo. You can get up close with all the animals. You can also purchase photos with certain animals. Food is not too bad for price. Only took around an hour or so for us to get through the park. Good for little kids that may be to young to walk",

          "We went there on a River Cruise on Miramar11. We missed our 10.00am outward Departure (our own fault) and the Captain kindly found us seats on the 11.00am Express Speed Boat. The sanctuary is a large, spread out area with a big population of Koalas, Kangaroos, Birds, Lizards",
          "This is the largest and oldest Koala Sanctuary in the world. If you love the indigenous creatures of this land you will love these animals. Unlike some of the states you are able to hold Koalas here, so if you want a cuddle, get in the queue as they are quite stick about the",

          "We had a great day at the Koala sanctuary. The park is not massive and to be fair the stars of the show are the Koalas, wallabies and kangaroos. We wanted to hold a Koala but the system is not great here as it\u2019s a queue up scenario meaning you could stand there for an hour plus",
          "I think this is a must go if you visit Brisbane. The main reason is you can cuddle a koala without leaving the city. If you haven't seen a koala before, it's the cutest creature ever, no matter what age you are, you will love it. You can also see other Australian animals here,",
          "Such a unique and awesome place, we loved every minute of our time here! One piece of advice - we had read a review that suggested not to wait in line to hold a Koala and just come back after 45 minutes or so and the line will be gone. Do not do this! We did this for the 12",

          "Lone Pine surely is a must go attraction in Brisbane! I came long way here from Hong Kong and being surprised by the superb view and cut Koala here! Kangaroos here also friendly and guess what, you can feed them!",
          "Pretty cool being able to walk up to a few of the animals and pet the kangaroos, emus, snakes, and koalas.  The staff ar very knowledgeable of the animals.  Had a great time.  Highly recommend!!!",
          "Best place around to have some good time with young kids!\nwe will sure be back!!",
          "Amazing place! It's perfect to have a day of fun and learning about Koalas, Kangaroos, Platypus, birds, dogs and lots of other animals. Congrats to the staff by the excellent work with the animals!",
          "It was a long time ago when I visited, 1989 to be exact. The memory of having held a Koala, my souvenir photo, and photos of the all the others, wallabies, emu's etc... are among some of the most cherished moments of my life. Please enjoy \u2026",
          "Come here early. It's becoming very popular with tours. We were here o  a Saturday,and by 11am there were 4 tour buses outside. Get in the queue for the \ud83d\udc28 picture as soon as possible! It gets longer by the minute!",
          "Great spot, not only they have tons of koalas they also have lots of other animals there. they have an open area with lots of kangaroos and emus where everyone can feed the animals and interact with them. There are lots of educating shows and feedings.",
          "Imagine that you are on a family trip to Australia and you want to make a memory with the koalas. Then you should visit Brisbane you and you are recommended to go to the popular Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. The old but still beautiful \u2026",
          "I loved it here.  We got a good deal online and spent half the day there.  The kids loved feeding the kangaroos and watching the different shows.  Highlight was getting to hold the sleepy koalas (for a price. But I thought it was \u2026",
          "If you can find a good deal online, it's a pretty inexpensive day out. Though, paying full price on entry helps the sanctuary to continue operating. So, I'm happy to support their cause \ud83d\ude0a. It's an EXCELLENT place to go for families with \u2026",
          "I really enjoyed the visit to this sanctuary. There are a few Red Kangaroos here you can pet and feed and there are TONS of koalas. The shop/cafe has lots of photos of famous people stopping by to hold the koalas which is really neat too. We spent a couple of hours here and it was well worth the trip!",
          "This place is awesome. Where else can you pet a kangaroo, sip coffee next to a Koala, and listen to the birds? Your kids will love it.",
          "Love it, and all the animals! \n\nI did feel some of the animals could have bigger cages/areas, but I do hope that experts have agreed to these sizes. \n\nThe koala hugging was sold out before we got there, which was before 9(the opening), sp that was weird. \n\nAll in all, a great day here!",
          "We have visited 3 times now. So glad we purchased the annual pass, it is great value for money. You see something different with every visit, we love the very friendly emu's. And the fish and chips at the eatery are just the best.",
          "Despite Lone Pine being very close to my house, I only visited for the first time in December 2019 when I had a relative visiting from overseas. I think its a great place to visit with kids and overseas visitors. I especially like the open area with free roaming Kangaroos and Emus.",
          "What is not to love! Get up close with some amazing animals, have lunch with some inquisitive lizards wandering about or surrounded by koalas. This place is wonderful",
          "Love this place - love feeding the kangaroos and emus, spotting the snakes and other reptiles and watching all of the animals.  I don't think I could pick a favourite area or animal but I do love the free flight bird show - it's awesome",
          "I went for the kangoroos and not dissappointed. The koalas are also cute (until you hear their voices, that is). Public bus will bring you right to the sanctuary just make sure you can catch the return bus as its easy to lost track of time. Taxis are available but i can't imagine how expensive would it be for a ride to the city.",
          "This place was wonderful all the animal looks relax and not afraid of human. Most of the animal were moving freely on the premises that they were in. The stuff seems like they care a lot about the animals and always educate the visitors about those animals. This visit was fulfilling for me and my family.",
          "Had a great Christmas day there with my boyfriend. Those koalas are really cute!! The place is well cared and good for visits!! Thanks for not being only zoo, but also science centre for good researches and museums. Very well done!",
          "Great day. I visited this place 3 times the past 3 months. I love it. Love seing all the koalas there and the free space where you can feed the kangaroos is stunning. They also have other animals there.",
          "I love Koalas \ud83d\udc28! They are so cute. We paid to have a picture with the \ud83d\udc28 and it's worth it! Great experience! You can also see other animals here, like kangaroos. I was looking for bigger Kangaroos with babies in their pockets, but sadly we did not see one.  They have restaurant here, so your stomack has no worry.",
          "beautiful spot. lovely day spent there",
          "My kids love visiting Lone Pine. We got a annual pass so we can visit for a couple of hours at a time. The Sanctuary is big enough to spend more time, and take in a show or grab a special cuddle with a koala. Our favourites are the platypie, kangaroo feeding and of course the koalas! Highly recommended.",
          "Great place to experience the native wildlife of Australia. Got to touch and feed kangaroo. You can hold koala by yourself. Need to pay for holding a koala but touching the koala is free and is generally crowded. Better to book to hold koala instead of waiting in the long queue",
          "More than just holding a koala. \nI really recommend going to the keepers talks as they are all very knowledgeable, and more than happy to explain things. You do also get to hold a koala.",
          "We had the most amazing day. Definitely a top order priority to get here. We were here easily 4 hours. Just sitting down chilling with the Roos. So many koalas and other beautiful animals. Will definitely be coming back. \n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udda4",
          "Convenient way to see lots of native wildlife in the city. The park is small enough to walk round in a couple of hours. It's also well kept and well laid out.",
          "An excellent place to see Koalas. I have never seen so many in one place! I thought I would hear more about conservation and protection of the Koalas in the wild, however - I assumed since it was named 'a sanctuary' we would hear more about \u2026",
          "This place is fabulous.  Koalas everywhere, big interactive field of  kangas and wallabies you can chill with and a brilliant birds of prey show. Its not crowded. Highly recommend. And worth the highish price.",
          "It is a fun day out, we got a family yearly family pass so it is more cost effective, the park isn't to big to walk around, and the show are timed well. Great place to wear out the kids.",
          "The sanctuary was a recommendation from a local Brisbane friend and didn't let us down. It's only a 25 minute taxi ride from the centre of Brisbane so very easy to find. Lots of animals to see and be seen with as you can photos with snakes, \u2026",
          "I wish Koala s long life!\n\nClimate change is so real. We weren't given Koala to hold because it was apparently too hot for them in the afternoon. Prefer a morning slot and plant more trees for making this place a forever one!",
          "Not your typical zoo, but an awesome place that definitely does a good deed with animals. Great opportunity to see Australian fauna while helping.",
          "Good place to see the critters that you don't get to see in the wild very often or at all. Self guiding, shows and photo opportunities,  big cafe and reasonably priced retail shop at exit. Good day out for everyone.",
          "Best zoo in Australia. You could feed the kangaroos and you could also hold a koala. Also the shows were really interesting and i'd highly recommend this adventure to everyone. Was a really nice day",
          "Best value zoo around, always something to see and the Australian fauna is so diverse you can spend all day here, the cafe is reasonably priced. Love the park and movie nights.",
          "If you visit Brisbane you must Visit Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary very good experience. You can see Koala  everywhere. But kangaroo little bit lazy \ud83d\ude1c  You have to feed the food in the new mouth the kangaroo will eat. Most important for MUSLIM inside Lone Pine have a halal restoran.",
          "It is quiet far from the city but it was worth the visit. You will have the chance for a close encounter with kangaroos and a koala. For handling a koala. You do need to buy 1 more ticket. Just come early or else it could be sold out \u2026",
          "Always THE place to go if you want to see koalas. But expect to wait in a long line for your koala photo. We decided not to do it after all (too long of a wait in a line full of loud and excited tourists. Couldn't really imagine that this \u2026",
          "This place was amazing! I was visiting Brisbane from the U.S. and read about the sanctuary. I did the river tour to the sanctuary, held a koala, and pet kangaroos! Where else can you do that! I loved every minute. Highly recommended.",
          "A great place to see wildlife native to Australia. You can feed and interact with kangaroos, hold a Koala, and for the adventurous hold a snake.",
          "It's not a huge park, but the animals lived well. The animals have well looked after. The sanctuary was lovely, and there are lots of chances to learn about the animals, as well as hold them or feed them. You can get close to the kangaroos. It also has several species, including birds and some reptiles. It's a must-visit area.",
          "Great experience with kangaroos. You can give them food for 2$.\nHowever, the picture with the koala doesn't worth. Waiting for one hour and spending 25 $ is disappointing. Don't do that. It's not useful to have an amazing day.",
          "We took our two grandchildren and they really enjoyed seeing all the wild life.They loved being able to be so close to the kangaroos and the koalas.\nDisappointed by the food in the cafe,the worst sandwich I have ever had! You could do with \u2026",
          "Great to wander among the indigenous trees and see the Australian wildlife in a close to natural setting. Great restaurant. The shows are very informative.",
          "I love everything about this place! The staff are an indication of how nice a place is and the staff here are happy and delightful... as are the animals.\nIt's quite a customer focused place.. free WiFi, phone charging stations, FREE \u2026",
          "Haven't been here since i was a child.. Don't rename ask that much except for the lorikeets.\nAnd the place where the birds were seemed much bigger than.. Its a great day out.. Enjoyed it",
          "It's impossible not to fall in love with this place. I had read a few negative reviews about the long queues but nothing such. It was well organized and they have time slots for photo sessions. I think the prices are high but necessary to \u2026",
          "Very nice Sanctuary. Clean cages and happy animals. Friendly and very educated staff. There are animal shows and you can take photos with koalas. They also have new adorable dingo puppies \nAbsolutely worth to visit",
          "We had the best tour of reptiles. McKenzie was fantastic. She made us feel very welcome and I held a big snake amongst other reptiles. If you get a chance definitely do the reptile experience,you will love it!",
          "Great place to spend the day . A little pricy for the photo with the koala but still really cool. Lots of kangaroos to feed and hangout with. The bird show was cool also! It would be cool if they had more reptile  and crocodile stuff but a great day with the family !",
          "Beautiful animals, great place. Bring the kids or just yourself but it's a great half day spent outside learning about Australian animals.",
          "Only 30 mins from city by bus! Can touch the koala for free, interesting experience.\n20200316.",

          "Sanctuary which permit you to enjoy nature and its marvellous animals.",
          "Lovely place to spend a few hours at. Very friendly staff that is knowledgable and always ready to help. You can stroke a kangaroo or hold a koala for a picture if you want to.",
          "A great place to come see the wildlife native to Australia. The kangaroo enclosure is a must and let's you feed and get up close to them for a photo opportunity. It can be a long wait for the  koala photo, so get in line early.",
          "Amazing place to visit. Lots of information. Got to pet a koala, for free, also fed and stroked a kangaroo and an emu. So much to do and see. Will be recommending to everyone.",
          "Does not feel very natural. Kids can get really close to animals but we don\u2019t like zoos, and this felt like one.",
          "The nicest zoo in the city!! The kangaroo and koalas are all adorable!! But sometimes if you go to here in the afternoon, they will have a nap\ud83e\udd23",
          "Feed 'roos, pet a koala (and sometimes a dingo pup) for free, hold a koala for about $20, and check out a bunch of other critters. Do the whole thing in under 2 hours. Great for small kids or just a quick stop if you don't want to go to a huge zoo or fight crowds just to see the local fauna.",
          "Amazing place! Very busy during holiday season. Would recommend to wait and visit when less crowded. The animals dont seem to enjoy the crowds and hide away from the tourists.",
          "Lots of cute animals. Informative talks. I'd greatly recommend getting a membership. If you even come twice, it's worth it.",
          "Very expensive experience. Everything have an additional cost, you have to pay extra for a map.\nThe website does not provide you with any useful information so that you can plan your day\n.\nWe went specifically to this facility so that our \u2026",

          "A great place to see and learn (through keeper talks) about a variety of Australian animals and barn animals. Walk amongst kangaroos and feed them, get a photo holding a koala if you wish. A great place to visit.",
          "What a great place to visit. It has been a few years since I went last. It's definitely worth a visit \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "We were very pleased with our experience at lone pine. The day we were there was apparently one of the hottest days of the year and you could see that the staff were making every attempt to make sure the animals were comfortable. Despite the heat we had a great time here!",
          "This was the biggest reason for my trip to Australia and it did not disappoint. I've always loved koalas (and Australian wildlife in general), and I knew this would be the best place for me to see them. I was especially fortunate in that I \u2026",
          "They have great mission - they heal injured animals. Unfortunately most animals can't go back to the nature - they can't survive. It's why they keep animals (and keep looking after them).\nNice and lovely place - lots of koalas, kangaroos, \u2026",
          "Lovely place to visit. Had an amazing time. My son loved it",
          "Great place to meet koalas. Those koalas are so cute and adorable.",

          "This is a very nice place to see Koala and Kangaroo.. you hold Koala and take pictures. There is a huge line for photos and only limited number of photos are taken in a day.. you can also feed Kangaroo in the open. There is a lot of them \u2026",

          "Great place to interact with some of Australia\u2019s iconic wildlife ... Cuddle a Koala, feed the kangaroos, pat a cassowary. Located on the Brisbane river it is accessible easily by a 30 minute boat trip or by car.",
          "Beautiful animals, lovely staff and informative  boards about the animals. However, the products you can purchase is a bit extreme on pricing. Bring your own water, for a single water bottle is 4 dollars. A small stuffed koala is $40.",

          "Lone pine sanctuary is a tourist attraction and stands by it. One of the best place to observe koalas and kangaroos in their natural habitat. You can even click photos with them \ud83d\ude0a. Various species of birds like the laughing kookaburra can \u2026",
          "Perfect size sanctuary to visit over and over or just once. We have a family pass so tend to visit often. Always a great visit!",

          "Place was amazing, loved koalas, pics with special birds, kangaroos and alot more to see, wild life and the way presented there was good",
          "Great place for a half day trip. If you want to hold a Koala then be sure to be at the wait area at least 1 hour before to ensure that you get one of the limited tickets. Bird show and sheep herding show are very good and give you a chance \u2026",

          "Definitely a must-do when you are in Brisbane and around. It is crowded around noon but still authentic enough. The fees help to protect the animals so it is more than fair you have to pay for it.",
          "As expected, lots of Koalas and other Aus wildlife BUT unless you got there early enough to be ahead in the line you would not be touching a Koala!\nQuite rightly,  to limit stress on the animals, they have rather short sessions of contact. Lovely place to visit though.",

          "The park itself is nice with good interaction with the wildlife but the management has a lot to be desired.  What ever you do don't use the self service ticket machine's out the front. They charged me 3 times for 1 ticket and my complaint \u2026",
          "I love Lone Pine! It's the one place I take international guests who cannot wait to see a kangaroo and a koala (amongst other great Australian animals). The grounds are beautiful too.",

          "I had visited this place twenty years back. Happy to remind old memories.",

          "Excellent day out. Really recommend coordinating your visit so that you see the demonstrations and talks, they are well worth the effort.",
          "Funnily enough, the koalas weren't the best thing for me. Interaction with them is really fairly limited and they aren't that active as well, which means that they don't move most of the time. To be able to hold them and take a photo with \u2026",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Victoria Bridge is a vehicular and pedestrian bridge over the Brisbane River. The current bridge, opened in 1969, is the third permanent crossing erected at this location. It is shared by vehicular traffic, pedestrians and cyclists.\nVictoria Bridge connects South Brisbane near the South Bank Parklands and Queensland Cultural Centre to the Brisbane central business district (CBD) at North Quay.\nHalf of the road space on the bridge is now given over to the South-East Busway. In the 2006 Brisbane City Centre Draft Masterplan, a new crossing immediately adjacent to the Victoria Bridge, tentatively named the Adelaide Street Bridge was recommended for a feasibility study.\n\n\n== Former bridges at this site ==\n\nConstruction of a bridge across the Brisbane River was first agreed to in 1861. The newly formed Legislative Assembly of Queensland forced the council to pay for the costs. \u00a370,000 worth of borrowings was acquired from the Bank of Queensland.\nWork first began on the foundations for the first bridge across the Brisbane River on 22 August 1864. The bridge, known as the Brisbane Bridge, was a tolled, timber structure which opened in June 1865. It was a temporary structure which was to be replaced by a more elaborately designed, iron lattice-girder bridge.  The Bank of Queensland failed in July 1866, bringing about a halt to funding for the project. The state government was reluctant to take on responsibility for the bridge's construction because it didn't want to incur debt. The timber bridge quickly succumbed to marine wood worm and began to progressively collapse. The council wasn't able to fully repair the structure and its remnants took two years to fall away into the river.In 1871, an English company, Peto, Brassey and Co, agreed to complete the bridge. A new crossing, opened on 15 June 1874 by the Governor of Queensland, the George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby, was an iron structure and a toll bridge. The bridge was paid for by significant council borrowings that were to be recouped by tolls. However a lack of revenue forced its transfer to the Colonial Government. The tolls were abolished at this time. It included a turning span to allow tall masted river traffic to pass upstream. The position of the swinging span was fixed when the tram-lines were laid along the bridge. It carried a 6 in (0.15 m) and a 9 in (0.23 m) diameter pipe which supplied mains water to South Brisbane. This bridge was partially washed away in the 1893 Brisbane flood.\n\nAnother replacement bridge was built and entered service in 1897, lasting until 1969, when it was demolished. In the meantime, ferries were used to transport people and goods. This second bridge was designed by Alfred Barton Brady. It was constructed of steel and wrought iron (superstructure), cast iron  (structure) and stone (abutments and wing walls - purple hard stone/porphiry, brown freestone and portland cement) and had two carriage ways and two footpaths. As early as 1943 evidence of the bridge buckling from the weight of increased traffic was noticed.  Tram numbers on the bridge had to be restricted and the footpath removed as a result.\nA new bridge which was opened on 14 April 1969, was needed to meet growing traffic demands. It cost A$3.2 million and featured a modern design which has been described as sleek and elegant. For a short period both bridges were open, each operating in one direction only.A portion of the southern abutment of the previous bridge remains adjacent to the new bridge, carrying a pedestrian arch, a short remnant of tram track and a memorial to Hector Vasyli, a young boy who was killed in a traffic accident at that point when waving to servicemen returning from the First World War. The abutment is heritage-listed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBridges over the Brisbane River\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDestruction of the Victoria Bridge: 1893 Brisbane Flood \u2013 John Oxley Library Blog\nBrisbane City Centre Draft Masterplan\nVictoria Bridge at Structurae",

        "wiki": "The Parliament of Queensland is the legislature of Queensland, Australia. As provided under the Constitution of Queensland, the Parliament consists of the Monarch of Australia and the Legislative Assembly. It is the only unicameral state parliament in the country.  The upper chamber, the Legislative Council, was abolished in 1922. The Legislative Assembly sits in Parliament House in the state capital, Brisbane.\nAll laws applicable in Queensland are authorised by the Parliament of Queensland, with the exception of specific legislation defined in the Constitution of Australia, very limted criminal law applying under the Australia Act 1986 as well as a small volume of remaining historical laws passed by the Parliament of New South Wales and the Imperial Parliament.Following the outcome of the 2015 election, successful amendments to the electoral act in early 2016 include: adding an additional four parliamentary seats from 89 to 93, changing from optional preferential voting to full-preferential voting, and moving from unfixed three-year terms to fixed four-year terms.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Parliament was founded 22 May 1860, less than a year after the Colony of Queensland was created in June 1859. It was convened at military and convict barracks converted for the purpose located on Queen Street, Brisbane.  Immigration was an important issue for the early Parliament.  Population growth was encouraged with new settlers enticed by land ownership.In 1915, Queensland became the first state to make voting compulsory at state elections.Since 1 April 2003, live audio broadcasts have streamed through the internet from the Parliament while it is in session. In June 2007, the Parliament started broadcasting video of parliamentary proceedings.  Nine in-house television cameras are used to record sessions.The first female Speaker, Fiona Simpson was elected on 15 May 2012.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\nThe Assembly has 93 Members of Parliament (MPs). These are intended to represent approximately the same population in each electorate. Voting is by the Full Preferential Voting system (FPV), with elections held approximately once every three years.\nIn April 2016, legislation was passed to increase the number of seats in the parliament by four to a total of 93. An amendment was also passed to abolish optional preferential voting. A referendum held the previous month was passed, supporting a bill to establish fixed four-year terms.\n\n\n== Royal assent ==\nThe role of the monarch in Parliament is to give royal assent to legislation. This function is in practice exercised by the Governor of Queensland, who conventionally will never refuse assent to a bill that has passed the Legislative Assembly. The party or coalition with the most seats in the house is invited by the Governor to form a government.\nThe leader of that party subsequently becomes Premier of Queensland, leading a Cabinet of Ministers. In the Liberal National Party, the Premier selects members of their party to act as Ministers. In the Labor Party, the Ministers are elected by partyroom ballot, with the Leader then assigning ministerial portfolios to each one.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nOnce all winning candidates have been declared, the Governor of Queensland proclaims a date for the start of the new Parliament.  It is the role of the Clerk of the Parliament to call members to attendance.\nAccording to the Constitution of Queensland, members of Parliament must swear an oath or affirmation to the Monarch of Australia as well as an oath of office before signing a Roll of Members.  The Clerk of the Parliament has the power to swear in members.\nSworn-in representatives are required to elect a Speaker to preside over the House's business.  Before this occurs the Clerk may select and point to the next member who may speak.  Once elected the Speaker is dragged to the chair and presented to the Governor at Government House.  The ceremonial opening of the new Parliament is marked by a speech by the Governor.  Traditionally the speech is written by the new government and it may outline current activities, budget details, statistics and proposed lists of legislation which are intended to be introduced.\n\nA day in Parliament usually begins with housekeeping matters, including prayers, notifications and the tabling of any documents.  An opportunity is then given to Ministers to make statements.  During a period of no more than an hour, known as question time, any member may pose a question to a Minister.\n\n\n== Distribution of seats ==\n\nAs of April 2020, the composition of Parliament is:\n\n47 votes as a majority are required to pass legislation.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNext Queensland state election\nParliaments of the Australian states and territories\nLegislative Assembly of Queensland\nList of members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly\nPalaszczuk Ministry\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

After closing in 1992, the larger 1960s section was demolished, leaving the heritage listed section (built as a women\u2019s prison in 1905), which is open to the public through guided tours run by Boggo Road Gaol Pty Ltd.It was officially known as \"Brisbane Gaol\" but was commonly known as \"Boggo Road\" after the original name of the Annerley Road. A new street formed after 1996 now has the name Boggo Road.  \n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1850s the district where the gaol was subsequently located was known unofficially as 'Boggo', and by the 1860s the track through the area was known as Boggo Road.It has been suggested that the name came about because the area was very boggy in wet weather. Another theory is that Boggo (or 'Bloggo' or 'Bolgo') was a corruption of an Aboriginal word meaning 'two leaning trees', and that the road was named after two prominent trees at either One-Mile Swamp or what is now Wilkins Street, off Annerley Road. Another possibility is that Boggo Road was an unofficial and unmaintained short-cut between Ipswich Road and Stanley Street that became very boggy after rain. Boggo Road was officially renamed Annerley Road in 1903, but the colloquial name for the gaol that had long been in use stayed.In 1863, land off Boggo Road was set aside as a government reserve, finally proclaimed a gaol reserve in 1880.  The first cellblock opened on 2 July 1883, built by Robert Porter, contained 57 cells, and was constructed using materials from the demolished Petrie Terrace Jail. In 1903 a new prison was built to hold female prisoners. This later became known as the No.2 Division, and is now the only section still standing, and is listed on the Queensland State Heritage Register. The 'No.1 Division' built in 1883 was the scene of 42 hangings, including the hanging of Ernest Austin in 1913\u2014the last execution in Queensland. A new prison was built around the perimeter of No.1 prison during the 1960s and No.1 prison was demolished leaving area for an oval and recreational facilities for the newly built prison, which had running cold water and toilet facilities in all cells. Under the oval was the facility that became known as the \"black hole\" where prisoners were subjected to \"punishment\". The \"black hole\" continued in use until the late '80s. A new women\u2019s gaol was also built at this time. The gaol was originally designed to cater for 40 male prisoners serving as a holding place for prisoners heading to St Helena Island in Moreton Bay. However, by 1989 there were 187 male prisoners and the women's facility had around 200 additional prisoners.\nProtests at the gaol during the 1970s saw inmates undertake hunger strikes, roof-top protests, and rioting over the poor conditions and treatment. The prison was constantly in the headlines and became notorious around Australia. Cells in the No. 2 prison did not have any form of sanitation, and facilities for washing were lacking. Prisoners were required to use a bucket through the evening for toilet breaks and empty it, or 'slop out', in the morning. A Queensland Government inquiry into the living conditions of State prisons found Boggo Road to be outdated and inadequate for prisoners' needs. No. 2 Division was closed in 1989. No. 1 division was closed in 1992 and was demolished in 1996 (a small section of what was \"C5\" and guard tower still remain). The women\u2019s prison operated until 2000 and was demolished in 2006.Since 1992 the No. 2 Division was home to the Boggo Road Gaol Museum, which featured displays of prison-related artefacts. Throughout the 1990s ex-officers conducted guided tours of the site, and from 2003 the museum and tours were operated by the Boggo Road Gaol Historical Society, a non-profit incorporated association of volunteers. Since December 2012, Boggo Road Gaol became a tourist attraction for Queensland, with guided tours being conducted by Boggo Road Gaol Pty, who are now officially licensed to run tours and events at the gaol. Like many other similar places around the country, the site also hosts guided ghost tours.\nRedevelopment of the surrounding site began in 2006, leading to the temporary closure of the Boggo Road Gaol historical site. Since 2012 the gaol has been re-opened to the public. Boggo Road has since been turned into an urban village called Boggo Road Urban Village and was completed in 2010.\n\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe No. 2 Division and the remnants of No. 1 Division were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1993.\n\n\n== Notable prisoners ==\nHon.

          "90 minutes of history about a pretty decent prison that outlived and outgrew it's usefulness, ending up being a stain on the prison system in Queensland.  Hearing the conditions under which men had to sleep and survive in the 80s meant it was no wonder riots took place.  A very different place prior to then.",

        "wiki": "Daisy Hill is a suburb of Logan City, Queensland, Australia. Part of the suburb's western boundary follows the Pacific Motorway.  A large proportion of the Daisy Hill is protected by the Daisy Hill Conservation Park.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Dennis family were first Europeans to settle at Daisy Hill. James Dennis immigrated in 1864 on the ship Flying Cloud. In 1867, he married Mary Ann Markwell. Around 1870 they began selecting land in the now Daisy Hill area, eventually acquiring over 320 hectares (800 acres). They named the property Daisy Hill, supposedly because their daughters saw daisies growing on the hill.Other early pioneers were the Usher family, who grew grapes and made and sold wine. Daisy Hill was once part of the Shire of Tingalpa.At the 2011 census Daisy Hill  had a population of 6,255 people.\n\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nDaisy Hill has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n2 Boronia Drive: Old St Mark's Anglican Church\n\n\n== Daisy Hill State Forest ==\nThe Daisy Hill State Forest was declared a timber reserve in 1874. In 1917 it was declared a State Forest and in 1986 a State Forest Park. The forest was used for timber gathering, honey making, gold mining and grazing. In 2006, it was gazetted as Daisy Hill Conservation Park to be used for habitat conservation and recreation; it contains the Daisy Hill Koala Centre. In June 2017, the Queensland State Government allocated  Daisy Hill Koala Centre $3.3 million to upgrade the premises, in the lead up to the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.  The park is considered to be one of the best mountain bike riding areas in Australia.A Reserve for Rifle Range was gazetted in 1901 from part of the west side of the original timber reserve. It was proposed for use by the Forest Rangers Rifle Club of Slacks Creek with a recommendation from the Queensland Defence Force. Initially the range consisted of 10 ha (25 acres), 1,010 by 100 metres (1,100 by 110 yards), with the line of fire terminated by a natural rise. The range was re-gazetted as reserve R.799 in 1902 with an increase in area towards and behind the targets for safety, forming a total area of around 50 ha (123 acres). In 1908, the military officer supervising rifle clubs in Queensland reported that the range was not then in use due to destruction of mantlets and targets by bush fire. The land was reinstated as part of the State Forest in 1952.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn the 2011 census, Daisy Hill recorded a population of 6,255 people, 49.7% female and 50.3% male.

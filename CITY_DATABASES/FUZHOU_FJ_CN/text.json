Its name is derived from the three lanes of Yijin (\u8863\u9526), Wenru (\u6587\u5112), and Guanglu (\u5149\u7984) and the seven alleys of Yangqiao (\u6768\u6865), Langguan (\u90ce\u5b98), Ta (\u5854),  Huang (\u9ec4), Anmin (\u5b89\u6c11), Gong (\u5bab), Jipi (\u5409\u5e87). Covering a total area of 38 hectares, it is celebrated as an architectural museum of Ming and Qing Dynasty buildings, including numerous National Designated Monuments like the historic residences of Yan Fu, Lin Congyi, Bing Xin and Lin Juemin. \nBecause of its more than 400 rich, famous and powerful residents, this port city was known as 'Beverly Hills' of imperial China. \nThanks to its fame as a living fossil of traditional Chinese urban wards of Li (\u91cc) and Fang (\u574a) that date back to as early as Tang Dynasty, it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List in 2013, and later designated a National Historic and Cultural Street by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 2015. Owing to the extraordinary efforts to protect the historic fabrics from Sanfang Qixiang Administration, it was awarded 2015 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards as Honourable Mention.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "name": "Fujian Museum",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Fujian (\u798f\u5efa; alternately romanized as Fukien or Hokkien Province) is a province on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Fujian is bordered by Zhejiang to the north, Jiangxi to the west, Guangdong to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the east. Its capital is Fuzhou, while its largest city by population is Xiamen, both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province. The name Fujian originated from the combination of the city names of Fuzhou and nearby Jianzhou (present-day Nanping) during the Tang dynasty.\nWhile its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. Historically the dialects of the language group Min Chinese were most commonly spoken within the province, including the Hokkien dialects of southeastern Fujian. This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province's name (\u95fd). Hakka Chinese is also spoken, by the Hakka people in Fujian. Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with Mandarin Chinese. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines speak Southern Min (or Hokkien).\nAs a result of the Chinese Civil War, Historical Fujian is now divided between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan), and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administrative divisions. The majority of the territory of historical Fujian (the mainland territory and a few islands) currently make up the Fujian province of the PRC. The Fujian province of the ROC constitutes to two counties (Kinmen and Lienchiang), which consist of three offshore archipelagos namely the Kinmen Islands, the Matsu Islands and the Wuqiu Islands.\nWith a population of 39 million, Fujian ranks 17th in population among Chinese provinces. Its GDP is CN\u00a53.58 trillion, ranking 10th in GDP. Along with its coastal neighbours Zhejiang and Guangdong, Fujian's GDP per capita is above the national average, at CN\u00a592,830. It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric Fujian ===\nRecent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the Neolithic Age by the middle of the 6th millennium BC. From the Keqiutou site (7450\u20135590 BP), an early Neolithic site in Pingtan Island located about 70 kilometres (43 mi) southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, shells, bones, jades, and ceramics (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with spinning wheels, which is definitive evidence of weaving.\nThe Tanshishan (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71) site (5500\u20134000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and Chalcolithic Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun (\u9ec3\u571f\u5d19) site (ca.1325 BC), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the Bronze Age in character.\nTianlong Jiao (2013) notes that the Neolithic appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.\nThere were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal Zhejiang.\nKeqiutou culture (\u58f3\u4e18\u5934\u6587\u5316; c. 6000\u20135500 BP, or c. 4050\u20133550 BC)\nTanshishan culture (\u6619\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316; c. 5000\u20134300 BP, or c. 3050\u20132350 BC)\nDamaoshan culture (\u5927\u5e3d\u5c71\u6587\u5316; c. 5000\u20134300 BP)\nHuangguashan culture (\u9ec4\u74dc\u5c71\u6587\u5316; c. 4300\u20133500 BP, or c. 2350\u20131550 BC)There were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures. These are the Niubishan culture (\u725b\u9f3b\u5c71\u6587\u5316) from 5000\u20134000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture (\u846b\u82a6\u5c71\u6587\u5316) from 2050 to 1550 BC.\n\n\n=== Minyue kingdom ===\n\nFujian was also where the kingdom of Minyue was located. The word \"M\u01d0nyu\u00e8\" was derived by combining \"M\u01d0n\" (simplified Chinese: \u95fd; traditional Chinese: \u95a9; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: b\u00e2n), which is perhaps an ethnic name (simplified Chinese: \u86ee; traditional Chinese: \u883b; pinyin: m\u00e1n; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: b\u00e2n), and \"Yu\u00e8\", after the State of Yue, a Spring and Autumn period kingdom in Zhejiang to the north. This is because the royal family of Yu\u00e8 fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the State of Chu in 306 BC. M\u01d0n is also the name of the main river in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.\n\n\n=== Qin dynasty ===\nLi Si, the famous prime minister of Qin, deposed the king of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery. Minyue was a de facto kingdom until one of the emperors of the Qin dynasty, the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.\n\n\n=== Han dynasty ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the Qin dynasty's fall, civil war broke out between two warlords, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the Han dynasty. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue's status as a tributary independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in Fuzhou as well as a few locations in the Wuyi Mountains, which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern Guangdong, eastern Jiangxi, and southern Zhejiang.After Wuzhu's death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the Han dynasty as it expanded southward. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a military campaign against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.\nFujian was part of the much larger Yang Province (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (\u6b77\u967d; present-day He County, Anhui).\nThe Han dynasty collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the Three Kingdoms era. Sun Quan, the founder of the Kingdom of Wu, spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.\n\n\n=== Jin era ===\nThe first wave of immigration of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the Western Jin dynasty collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in central China: Lin (\u6797), Huang (\u9ec4), Chen (\u9648), Zheng (\u90d1), Zhan (\u8a79), Qiu (\u90b1, He (\u4f55, and Hu (\u80e1. The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian.Nevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the \"barbarian\" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two commanderies and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.\nDuring the Southern and Northern Dynasties era, the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang (Western Liang), and Chen) reigned south of the Yangtze River, including Fujian.\n\n\n=== Sui and Tang dynasties ===\n\nDuring the Sui and Tang eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian. The area did not become Sinicized until this time.During the Sui dynasty, Fujian was again part of Yang Province.\nDuring the Tang, Fujian was part of the larger Jiangnan East Circuit, whose capital was at Suzhou. Modern-day Fujian was composed of around 5 prefectures and 25 counties.\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian's culture and economy. Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to northern part of Fujian.\n\n\n=== Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms ===\nAs the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by General Wang, who set up an independent Kingdom of Min with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon absorbed by Southern Tang, another southern kingdom.Parts of northern Fujian were conquered by the Wuyue Kingdom to the north as well, including the Min capital Fuzhou.\nQuanzhou city was blooming into a seaport under the reign of the Min Kingdom and was the largest seaport in the world. For a long period of time its population was also greater than Fuzhou.Qingyuan Jiedushi was a military/governance office created in 949 by Southern Tang's second emperor Li Jing for the warlord Liu Congxiao, who nominally submitted to him but controlled Quan (\u6cc9\u5dde, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) and Zhang (\u6f33\u5dde, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures in de facto independence from the Southern Tang state.  (Zhang Prefecture was, at times during the circuit's existence, also known as Nan Prefecture (\u5357\u5dde).)  Starting in 960, in addition to being nominally submissive to Southern Tang, Qingyuan Circuit was also nominally submissive to Song, which had itself become Southern Tang's nominal overlord.\n\nAfter Liu's death, the circuit was briefly ruled by his biological nephew/adoptive son Liu Shaozi, who was then overthrown by the officers Zhang Hansi and Chen Hongjin.  Zhang then ruled the circuit briefly, before Chen deposed him and took over.  In 978, with Song's determination to unify Chinese lands in full order, Chen decided that he could not stay de facto independent, and offered the control of the circuit to Song's Emperor Taizong, ending Qingyuan Circuit as a de facto independent entity.\n\n\n=== Song dynasty ===\nThe area was reorganized into the Fujian Circuit in 985, which was the first time the name \"Fujian\" was used for an administrative region.Fujian or Guangxi was the origin of the ethnic Chinese Tran who migrated to Vietnam along with a large number of other Chinese, during the Vietnamese Ly dynasty, where they served as officials. Distinctly Chinese last names are found in the Tran and Ly dynasty Imperial exam records. Ethnic Chinese are recorded in Tran and Ly dynasty records of officials. Clothing, food, and language were all Chinese dominated in Van Don where the Tran had moved after leaving their home province of Fujian. The Chinese language could still be spoken by the Tran in Vietnam. The side of Vietnam that borders the ocean was colonized by Chinese migrants from Fujian. This included the Tran among them who settled in the capital's southeastern area. The Red River Delta was subjected to migration of people from different provinces all over China through Fujian's major city port. The Tran and Van Don port arose as a result of this interaction. Fujian and Guangdong Chinese moved to the Van Don coastal port during Ly Anh Tong's rule to engage in commerce. The usurpation of the Ly occurred after they married with the fishing Fujianese Tran family.In 1172 Fujian was attacked by Pi-she-ye pirates from Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Yuan dynasty ===\nAfter the establishment of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, Fujian became part of Jiangzhe province, whose capital was at Hangzhou. From 1357-1366 Muslims in Quanzhou rebelled in the Ispah Rebellion, advancing northward and even capturing Putian and Fuzhou before the rebellion was crushed by the Yuan. Afterwards, Quanzhou city lost foreign interest of trading and its formerly welcoming international image as the foreigners were all massacred or deported.\nYuan dynasty General Chen Youding, who had put down the Ispah Rebellion, continued to rule over the Fujian area even after the outbreak of the Red Turban Rebellion. Forces loyal to eventual Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang (Hongwu Emperor) defeated Chen in 1367.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty ===\nAfter the establishment of the Ming dynasty, Fujian became a province, with capital at Fuzhou. In the early Ming era, Quanzhou was the staging area and supply depot of Zheng He's naval expeditions. Further development was severely hampered by the sea trade ban, and the area was superseded by nearby ports of Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai despite the lifting of the ban in 1550. Large-scale piracy by Wokou was eventually wiped out by Chinese military and Japanese authority of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.An account of Ming dynasty Fujian was written by No In \u9c81\u8ba4.The Pisheya appear in Quanzhou Ming era records.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nThe late Ming and early Qing dynasty symbolized an era of large influx of refugees and another 20 years of sea trade ban under the Kangxi Emperor, a measure intended to counter the refuge Ming government of Koxinga in the island of Taiwan.\nThe sea ban implented by the Qing forced many people to evacuate the coast in order to deprive Koxinga's Ming loyalists of resources. This has led to the myth that it was because Manchus were \"afraid of water\".\nIncoming refugees did not translate into a major labor force, owing to their re-migration into prosperous regions of Guangdong. In 1683, the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan in the Battle of Penghu and annexed it into the Fujian province, as Taiwan Prefecture. Settlement of Taiwan by Han Chinese followed. Today, most Taiwanese are descendants of Hokkien people from Southern Fujian. Fujian arrived at its present extent after Taiwan was developed into an independent province (Fujian-Taiwan-Province) starting in 1885. Just ten years later, the Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan via the Treaty of Shimonoseki after losing the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nThe Xinhai revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty brought the province into the rule of the Republic of China.\nFujian briefly gained independence from China again under the Fujian People's Government until it was recontrolled by Republic of China.\nIt came under Japanese sea blockade during World War II.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nFujian's slow development in its early days has proved a blessing for the province's ecology; today, the province has the highest forest coverage rate and the most diverse biosphere in China whereas central China suffers from severe overpopulation and displays severe signs of soil erosion, with frequent droughts and floods due to lack of forest coverage.Development has been accompanied by a large influx of population from the overpopulated areas in the north and west, and much of the farmland and forest, as well as cultural heritage sites such as the temples of king Wuzhu, have given way to ubiquitous high-rise buildings. Fujian faces challenges at all levels to sustain development while at the same time preserving Fujian's natural and cultural heritage.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe province is mostly mountainous and is traditionally said to be \"eight parts mountain, one part water, and one part farmland\" (\u516b\u5c71\u4e00\u6c34\u4e00\u5206\u7530). The northwest is higher in altitude, with the Wuyi Mountains forming the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. It is the most forested provincial-level administrative region in China, with a 62.96% forest coverage rate in 2009. Fujian's highest point is Mount Huanggang in the Wuyi Mountains, with an altitude of 2,157 metres (1.340 mi).\nFujian faces East China Sea to the east, South China Sea to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the southeast. The coastline is rugged and has many bays and islands. Major islands include Quemoy (also known as Kinmen) (controlled by the Republic of China), Haitan Island, and Nanri Island. Meizhou Island occupies a central place in the cult of the goddess Matsu, the patron deity of Chinese sailors.\nThe Min River and its tributaries cut through much of northern and central Fujian. Other rivers include the Jin and the Jiulong. Due to its uneven topography, Fujian has many cliffs and rapids.\nFujian is separated from Taiwan by the 180 kilometres (110 mi)-wide Taiwan Strait. Some of the small islands in the Taiwan Strait are also part of the province. The islands of Quemoy and Matsu are under the administration of the Republic of China.\nFujian contains several faults, the result of collision between the Asiatic Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The Changle-Naoao and Longan-Jinjiang fault zones in this area have annual displacement rates of 3\u20135 mm. They could cause major earthquakes in the future.Fujian has a subtropical climate, with mild winters. In January, the coastal regions average around 7\u201310 \u00b0C (45\u201350 \u00b0F) while the hills average 6\u20138 \u00b0C (43\u201346 \u00b0F). In the summer, temperatures are high, and the province is threatened by typhoons coming in from the Pacific. Average annual precipitation is 1,400\u20132,000 millimetres (55\u201379 in).\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAs of 2012, there are 54,876 kilometres (34,098 miles) of highways in Fujian, including 3,500 kilometres (2,200 miles) of expressways. The top infrastructure projects in recent years have been the Zhangzhou-Zhaoan Expressway (US$624 million) and the Sanmingshi-Fuzhou expressway (US$1.40 billion). The 12th Five-Year Plan, covering the period from 2011 to 2015, aims to double the length of the province's expressways to 5,500 kilometres (3,400 mi).\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nDue to Fujian's mountainous terrain and traditional reliance on maritime transportation, railways came to the province comparatively late. The first rail links to neighboring Jiangxi, Guangdong and Zhejiang Province, opened respectively, in 1959, 2000 and 2009.  As of October 2013, Fujian has four rail links with Jiangxi to the northwest: the Yingtan\u2013Xiamen Railway (opened 1957), the Hengfeng\u2013Nanping Railway (1998), Ganzhou\u2013Longyan Railway (2005) and the high-speed Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway (2013).  Fujian's lone rail link to Guangdong to the west, the Zhangping\u2013Longchuan Railway (2000), will be joined with the high-speed Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen Railway (Xiashen Line) in late 2013.  The Xiashen Line forms the southern-most section of China's Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen sections of this corridor entered operation in 2009 and links Fujian with Zhejiang with trains running at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph).\nWithin Fujian, coastal and interior cities are linked by the Nanping\u2013Fuzhou (1959), Zhangping\u2013Quanzhou\u2013Xiaocuo (2007) and Longyan\u2013Xiamen Railways, (2012).  To attract Taiwanese investment, the province intends to increase its rail length by 50 percent to 2,500 km (1,553 mi).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe major airports are Fuzhou Changle International Airport, Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport, Quanzhou Jinjiang International Airport, Nanping Wuyishan Airport, Longyan Guanzhishan Airport and Sanming Shaxian Airport. Xiamen is capable of handling 15.75 million passengers as of 2011. Fuzhou is capable of handling 6.5 million passengers annually with a cargo capacity of more than 200,000 tons. The airport offers direct links to 45 destinations including international routes to Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe People's Republic of China controls most of the province and divides it into nine prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city):\n\nAll of the prefecture-level cities except Nanping, Sanming, and Longyan are found along the coast.\nThese nine prefecture-level cities are subdivided into 85 county-level divisions (28 districts, 13 county-level cities, and 44 counties). Those are in turn divided into 1,107 township-level divisions (605 towns, 328 townships, 18 ethnic townships, and 156 subdistricts).\nThe People's Republic of China claims five of the six townships of Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan) as a county of the prefecture-level city of Quanzhou.The PRC claims Wuqiu Township, Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan) as part of Xiuyu District of the prefecture-level city of Putian.\nFinally, the PRC claims Matsu Islands (Lienchiang County), Republic of China (Taiwan) as a township of its Lianjiang County, which is part of the prefecture-level city of Fuzhou.\nTogether, these three groups of islands make up the Republic of China's Fujian Province.\n\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nList of the Secretaries of the CPC Fujian Committee\n\nZhang Dingcheng (\u5f20\u9f0e\u4e1e): June 1949 \u2013 October 1954\nYe Fei (\u53f6\u98de): October 1954 \u2013 June 1958\nJiang Yizhen (\u6c5f\u4e00\u771f): acting 1958\u20131970\nHan Xianchu (\u97e9\u5148\u695a): April 1971 \u2013 December 1973\nLiao Zhigao (\u5ed6\u5fd7\u9ad8): December 1974 \u2013 February 1982\nXiang Nan (\u9879\u5357): February 1982 \u2013 March 1986\nChen Guangyi (\u9648\u5149\u6bc5): March 1986 \u2013 December 1993\nJia Qinglin (\u8d3e\u5e86\u6797): December 1993 \u2013 October 1996\nChen Mingyi (\u9648\u660e\u4e49): October 1996 \u2013 December 2000\u3000\nSong Defu (\u5b8b\u5fb7\u798f): December 2000 \u2013 February 2004\nLu Zhangong (\u5362\u5c55\u5de5): February 2004 \u2013 November 2009\nSun Chunlan (\u5b59\u6625\u5170): November 2009 \u2013 December 2012\nYou Quan (\u5c24\u6743): December 2012 \u2013 October 2017\nYu Weiguo (\u4e8e\u4f1f\u56fd): October 2017 \u2013 presentList of Governors\n\nZhang Dingcheng (\u5f20\u9f0e\u4e1e): August 1949 \u2013 October 1954 \u3000\nYe Fei (\u53f6\u98de): October 1954 \u2013 January 1959\nJiang Yizhen (\u6c5f\u4e00\u771f): October 1959 \u2013 December 1962\nWen Jinshui (\u9b4f\u91d1\u6c34): December 1962 \u2013 August 1968\u3000\nHan Xianchu (\u97e9\u5148\u695a): August 1968 \u2013 December 1973\nLiao Zhigao (\u5ed6\u5fd7\u9ad8): November 1974-December 1979\nMa Xingyuan (\u9a6c\u5174\u5143): December 1979 \u2013 January 1983\nHu Ping (\u80e1\u5e73): January 1983 \u2013 September 1987\nWang Zhaoguo (\u738b\u5146\u56fd): September 1987 \u2013 November 1990\nJia Qinglin (\u8d3e\u5e86\u6797): November 1990 \u2013 April 1994\nChen Mingyi (\u9648\u660e\u4e49): April 1994 \u2013 October 1996\nHe Guoqiang (\u8d3a\u56fd\u5f3a): October 1996 \u2013 August 1999\nXi Jinping (\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73): August 1999 \u2013 October 2002\nLu Zhangong (\u5362\u5c55\u5de5): October 2002 \u2013 December 2004\nHuang Xiaojing (\u9ec4\u5c0f\u6676): December 2004 \u2013 April 2011\nSu Shulin (\u82cf\u6811\u6797): April 2011 \u2013 November 2015\nYu Weiguo (\u4e8e\u4f1f\u56fd): November 2015 \u2013 January 2018\nTang Dengjie (\u5510\u767b\u6770): January 2018 \u2013 present\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFujian is one of the more affluent provinces with many industries spanning tea production, clothing and sports manufacturers such as Anta, 361 Degrees, Xtep, Peak Sport Products and Septwolves. Many foreign firms have operations in Fujian. They include Boeing, Dell, GE, Kodak, Nokia, Siemens, Swire, TDK and Panasonic.\nIn terms of agricultural land, Fujian is hilly and farmland is sparse. Rice is the main crop, supplemented by sweet potatoes and wheat and barley. Cash crops include sugar cane and rapeseed. Fujian leads the provinces of China in longan production, and is also a major producer of lychees and tea. Seafood is another important product, with shellfish production especially prominent.\nBecause of the geographic location with Taiwan, Fujian has been considered the battlefield frontline in a potential war between mainland China and Taiwan. Hence, it received much less investment from Chinese central government and developed much slower than the rest of China before 1978. Since 1978, when China opened to the world, Fujian has received significant investment from overseas Fujianese around the world, Taiwanese and foreign investment. Today, although Fujian is one of the wealthier provinces of China, its GDP per capita is only about the average of China's coastal administrative divisions.See also List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita\nMinnan Golden Triangle which includes Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou accounts for 40 percent of the GDP of Fujian province.\nFujian province will be the major economic beneficiary of the opening up of direct transport with Taiwan which commenced on December 15, 2008. This includes direct flights from Taiwan to major Fujian cities such as Xiamen and Fuzhou. In addition, ports in Xiamen, Quanzhou and Fuzhou will upgrade their port infrastructure for increased economic trade with Taiwan.Fujian is the host of China International Fair for Investment and Trade annually. It is held in Xiamen to promote foreign investment for all of China.\nIn 2011, Fujian's nominal GDP was 1.74 trillion yuan (US$276.3 billion), a rise of 13 percent from the previous year. Its GDP per capita was 46,802 yuan (US$7,246 (9th)).By 2015 Fujian expects to have at least 50 enterprises that have over 10 billion RMB in annual revenues.  The government also expects 55 percent of GDP growth to come from the industrial sector.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\n\nDongshan Economic and Technology Development Zone\nFuzhou Economic & Technical Development Zone\nFuzhou Free Trade Zone\nFuzhou Hi-Tech Park\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment Area\nJimei Taiwan Merchant Investment Area\nMeizhou Island National Tourist Holiday Resort\nWuyi Mountain National Tourist Holiday Resort\nXiamen Export Processing Zone\nXiamen Free Trade Zone\nXiamen Haicang Economic and Technological Development Zone\nXiamen Torch New & Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (Chinese version)\nXinglin Taiwan Merchant Investment Area\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 1832, the province was described as having an estimated \"population of fourteen millions.\"Han Chinese make up 98% of the population. Various Fujianese peoples (Min-speaking groups) make up the largest subgroups of Han Chinese in Fujian. This includes the Hoklo people, Fuzhounese people, Teochew people and Putian people.\nHakka, a Han Chinese people with its own distinct identity, live in the southwestern parts of the province bordering Guangdong. Hui'an, also a Han branch with their distinct culture and fashion, populate Fujian's southeast coastline near Chongwu in Hui'an County.  The She, scattered over mountainous regions in the north, is the largest minority ethnic group of the province.Many ethnic Chinese around the world, especially in Southeast Asia, trace their ancestries to the Fujianese branches of Hoklo people and Teochew people. Descendants of Southern Min speaking emigrants make up the predominant majority ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. While Eastern Min speaking people, especially Fuzhounese people, is one of the major sources of China immigrants in the United States, especially since the 1990s.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Fujian are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 31.31% of the population believes and is involved in Chinese ancestral religion, while 3.5% of the population identifies as Christian. The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; 65.19% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects, and small minorities of Muslims.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBecause of its mountainous nature and the numerous waves of migration from north and central China in the course of history, Fujian is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse places in all ethnic Chinese areas of China. Local dialects can become unintelligible within 10 kilometres (6.2 mi), and the regional cultures and ethnic composition can be completely different from each other as well. This is reflected in the expression that \"if you drive five miles in Fujian the culture changes, and if you drive ten miles, the language does\". Most varieties spoken in Fujian are assigned to a broad Min category. Early classifications, such as those of Li Fang-Kuei in 1937 and Yuan Jiahua in 1960, divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups. More recent classifications subdivide Min into\nSouthern Min, including the Amoy dialect and Taiwanese\nPu-Xian, spoken in central coastal areas\nEastern Min (the former Northern group), including the Fuzhou dialect\nNorthern Min, spoken in inland northern areas\nCentral Min, spoken in the west of the province\nShao-Jiang, spoken in the northwest(The seventh subdivision of Min, Qiong Wen, is not spoken in Fujian.) Hakka, another subdivision of spoken Chinese, is spoken around Longyan by the Hakka people who live there.\nAs is true of other provinces, the official language in Fujian is Mandarin, which is used for communication between people of different localities, although native Fujian peoples still converse in their native languages and dialects respectively.\nSeveral regions of Fujian have their own form of Chinese opera. Min opera is popular around Fuzhou; Gaojiaxi around Jinjiang and Quanzhou; Xiangju around Zhangzhou; Fujian Nanqu throughout the south, and Puxianxi around Putian and Xianyou County.\n\nFujian cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood, is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine. It is composed of traditions from various regions, including Fuzhou cuisine and Min Nan cuisine. The most prestigious dish is Fotiaoqiang (literally \"Buddha jumps over the wall\"), a complex dish making use of many ingredients, including shark fin, sea cucumber, abalone and Shaoxing wine (a type of Chinese alcoholic beverage).\nMany well-known teas originate from Fujian, including oolong, Wuyi Yancha, Lapsang souchong and Fuzhou jasmine tea. Indeed, the tea processing techniques for three major classes tea, namely, oolong, white tea and black tea were all developed in the province. Fujian tea ceremony is an elaborate way of preparing and serving tea. In fact, the English word \"tea\" is borrowed from Hokkien of the Min Nan languages. (Mandarin and Cantonese pronounce the word ch\u00e1.)\nFuzhou bodiless lacquer ware, a noted type of lacquer ware, is noted for using a body of clay and/or plaster to form its shape; the body later removed. Fuzhou is also known for Shoushan stone carvings.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nFujian is home to a number of tourist attractions, including four UNESCO World Heritage Sites, one of the highest in China.\nIn the capital of Fuzhou is the Yongquan Temple, a Buddhist temple built during the Tang dynasty.\nThe Wuyi Mountains was the first location in Fujian to be listed by UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 1999. They are a mountain range in the prefecture of Nanping and contains the highest peak in Fujian, Mount Huanggang. It is famous as a natural landscape garden and a summer resort in China.\nThe Fujian Tulou are Chinese rural dwellings unique to the Hakka in southwest Fujian. They were listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 2008.\nGulangyu Island, Xiamen, is notable for its beaches, winding lanes and rich architecture. The island is on China's list of National Scenic Spots and is classified as a 5A tourist attraction by the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA). It was listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Site in 2017. Also in Xiamen is the South Putuo Temple.\nThe Guanghua Temple is a Buddhist temple in Putian. It was built in the penultimate year of the Southern Chen Dynasty. Located in the northern half of the mouth of Meizhou Bay, it is about 1.8 nautical miles from the mainland and faces the Strait of Taiwan to the southeast. Covering an area of six square miles, the island is swathed in luxuriant green foliage. The coastline is indented with over 12 miles of beach area. Another buddhist temple, Nanshan Temple is located in Zhangzhou.\nAround Meizhou Islands is the Matsu pilgrimage.\nThe Kaiyuan Temple, is a Buddhist temple in West Street, Quanzhou, the largest in Fujian province with an area of 78,000 square metres (840,000 square feet). Although it is known as a both a Hindu and Buddhist temple, on account of added Tamil-Hindu influences, the main statue in the most important hall is that of Vairocana Buddha, the main Buddha according to Huayan Buddhism.\nMount Taimu is a mountain and a scenic resort in Fuding. It offers a grand view of mountain and sea, and is famous for its natural scenery including granite caves, odd-shaped stones, steep cliffs, clear streams, cascading waterfalls, and cultural attractions such as ancient temples and cliff Inscriptions.\nThe Danxia landform in Taining was listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 2010. It is a unique type of petrographic geomorphology found in China. Danxia landform is formed from red-coloured sandstones and conglomerates of largely Cretaceous age. The landforms look very much like karst topography that forms in areas underlain by limestones, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called \"pseudo-karst\" landforms. They were formed by endogenous forces (including uplift) and exogenous forces (including weathering and erosion).\n\n\n== Notable individuals ==\nThe province and its diaspora abroad also has a tradition of educational achievement and has produced many important scholars, statesmen and other notable people since the time of the Song dynasty, such as:\n\nCai Jing (1047\u20131126), government official and calligrapher who lived during the Northern Song dynasty\nLi Gang (1083\u20131140), a politician and general serving during the transition from the Northern Song to the Southern Song dynasty\nZhu Xi (1130\u20131200), Confucian philosopher\nHuang Senping (14th\u201315th century), royal son-in-law of Sultan Muhammad Shah of Brunei\nZhang Jing (1492\u20131555), Ming dynasty politician and general\nYu Dayou (1503\u20131579), Ming dynasty general and martial artist\nHuang Daozhou (1585\u20131646), Ming dynasty politician, calligrapher and scholar\nIngen (1592\u20131673), well known Buddhist monk, poet and calligrapher who lived during Ming Dynasty\nHong Chengchou (1593\u20131665), Ming dynasty official\nShi Lang (1621\u20131696), Qing dynasty admiral\nKoxinga (1624\u20131662), Ming dynasty general who expelled the Dutch from Taiwan\nLin Zexu (1785\u20131850), Qing dynasty scholar and official\nZhan Shi Chai (1840s\u20131893), entertainer as \"Chang the Chinese giant\"\nHuang Naishang  (1849\u20131924), scholar, revolutionary, discovered the town of Sibu in Sarawak, east Malaysia in 1901\nLin Shu (1852\u20131924), translator\nYan Fu (1854\u20131921), scholar and translator\nSa Zhenbing (1859\u20131952), high-ranking naval officer of Mongolian origin\nZheng Xiaoxu (1860\u20131938), statesman, diplomat and calligrapher\nLin Changmin(zh:\u6797\u9577\u6c11) (1876\u20141925), a high-rank governor in the Beiyang Government\nLin Juemin (1887\u20131911), one of 72 Revolutionary Martyrs at Huanghuagang, Guangzhou\nLin Yutang (1894\u20131976), writer\nZheng Zhenduo (1898\u20131958), literary historian\nOng Schan Tchow (Chinese: \u7fc1\u5360\u79cb) (1900\u20131945), artist well known for the painting of the \u201cBook of Chrysanthemums\u201d\nJos\u00e9 Rizal (1861\u20131896), National Hero of the Philippines whose lineage is from Fujian\nBing Xin (1900\u20131999), writer\nLin Huiyin (1904\u20131955), architect and writer\nTsai Chi-Kun (1912\u20132004), \"father of the Taiwan Symphony\"\nGo Seigen (1914\u20132014), pseudonym of Go champion W\u00fa Q\u012bngyu\u00e1n\nLiem Sioe Liong (1916\u20132012), a Chinese-born Indonesian businessman of Fuqing origin, founder of Salim Group\nChih-Tang Sah (born 1932), well-known electronics engineer of Mongolian origin\nLiu Yudong (born 1970), professional basketball player\nShi Zhiyong (born 1980), professional weightlifter\nLin Dan (born 1983), professional badminton player\nJeremy Lin (born 1988), professional basketball player\nWang Zhelin (born 1994), professional basketball player\n\n\n== Sports ==\nFujian includes professional sports teams in both the Chinese Basketball Association and the Chinese League One.\nThe representative of the province in the Chinese Basketball Association are the Fujian Sturgeons, who are based in Jinjiang, Quanzhou.

The chip has multiple audio input interfaces, and greater energy efficiency, featuring an embedded VAD (Voice Activation Detection).\n\n\n==== RV1108 ====\nThe announcement of RV1108 indicated Rockchip's moves to AI/computer vision territory.\nWith CEVA DSP embedded, RV1108 powers smart cameras including 360\u00b0 Video Camera, IPC, Drone, Car Camcoder, Sport DV, VR, etc. It also has been deployed for new retail and intelligent marketing applications with integrated algorithms.\n\n\n=== Early Products ===\nRK26xx series - Released 2006.\nRK27xx series - Rockchip was first known for their RK27xx series that was very efficient at MP3/MP4 decoding and was integrated in many low-cost personal media player (PMP) products.\nRK28xx series\nThe RK2806 was targeted at PMPs.\nThe RK2808A is an ARM926EJ-S derivative. Along with the ARM core a DSP coprocessor is included. The native clock speed is 560 MHz. ARM rates the performance of the ARM926EJ-S at 1.1 DMIPS/MHz the performance of the Rockchip 2808 when executing ARM instructions is therefore 660 DMIPS roughly 26% the speed of Apple's A4 processor. The DSP coprocessor can support the real-time decoding of 720p video files at bitrates of up to 2.5 Mbit/s. This chip was the core of many Android and Windows Mobile-based mobile internet devices..\nThe RK2816 was targeted at PMP devices, and MIDs. It has the same specifications as the RK2806 but also includes HDMI output, Android support, and up to 720p hardware video acceleration.\nRK29xx series\nThe Rockchip RK291x is a family of SoCs based on the ARM Cortex-A8 CPU core. They were presented for the first time at CES 2011. The RK292x are single core SoCs based on ARM Cortex-A9 and were first introduced in 2012.\nThe RK2918 was the first chip to decode Google WebM VP8 in hardware. It uses a dynamically configurable companion core to process various codecs. It encodes and decodes H.264 at 1080p, and can decode many standard video formats including Xvid, H.263, AVS, MPEG4, RV, and WMV. It includes a Vivante GC800 GPU that is compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenVG. The RK2918 is compatible with Android Froyo  (2.2), Gingerbread (2.3), HoneyComb (3.x) and Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0). Unofficial support for Ubuntu and other Linux flavours exists. As of 2013, it was targeted at E-readers.The RK2906 is basically a cost-reduced version of the RK2918, also targeted at E-readers as of 2013.The Rockchip RK2926 and RK2928 feature a single core ARM Cortex A9 running at a speed up to 1.0 GHz. It replaces the Vivante GC800 GPU of the older RK291x series with an ARM Mali-400 GPU. As of 2013, the RK2926 was targeted at tablets, while the RK2928 was targeted at tablets and Android TV dongles and boxes.The RK3066 is a high performance dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 mobile processor similar to the Samsung Exynos 4 Dual Core chip. In terms of performance, the RK3066 is between the Samsung Exynos 4210 and the Samsung Exynos 4212. As of 2013, it was targeted at tablets and Android TV dongles and boxes. It has been a popular choice for both tablets and other devices since 2012.\nThe RK3068 is a version of the RK3066 specifically targeted at Android TV dongles and boxes. Its package is much smaller than the RK3066.The RK3028 is a low-cost dual-core ARM Cortex-A9-based processor clocked at 1.0 GHz with ARM Mali-400 GPU. It is pin-compatible with the RK2928. It is used in a few kids tablets and low-cost Android HDMI TV dongles.The RK3026 is an updated ultra-low-end dual-core ARM Cortex-A9-based tablet processor clocked at 1.0 GHz with ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU. Manufactured at 40 nm, it is pin-compatible with the RK2926. It features 1080p H.264 video encoding and 1080p decoding in multiple formats. Supporting Android 4.4, it has been adopted for low-end tablets in 2014.\nThe RK3036 is a low-cost dual-core ARM Cortex-A7-based processor released in Q4 2014 for smart set-top boxes with support for H.265 video decoding.\n\n\n=== RK31xx series ===\nThe RK3188 was the first product in the RK31xx series, announced for production in the 2nd quarter of 2013. The RK3188 features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 clocked up to 1.6 GHz frequency. It is targeted at tablets and Android TV dongles and boxes,  and has been a popular choice for both tablets and other devices requiring good performance.\n\n28 nm HKMG process at GlobalFoundries\nQuad-core ARM Cortex-A9, up to 1.6 GHz\n512 KB L2 cache\nMali-400 MP4 GPU, up to 600 MHz (typically 533 MHz) supporting OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0, Open G 1.1\nHigh performance dedicated 2D processor\nDDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR2 support\nDual-panel display up to 2048x1536 resolutionThe RK3188T is a lower-clocked version of the RK3188, with the CPU cores running at a maximum speed of 1.4 GHz instead of 1.6 GHz. The Mali-400MP4 GPU is also clocked at a lower speed. As of early 2014, many devices advertised as using a RK3188 with a maximum clock speed of 1.6 GHz actually have a RK3188T with clock speed limited to 1.4 GHz. Operating system ROMs specifically made for the RK3188 may not work correctly with a RK3188T.\nThe RK3168, first shown in April 2013, is a dual-core Cortex A9-based CPU, also manufactured using the 28 nm process.  It is targeted at low-end tablets. The chip has seen only limited use as of May 2014.\nThe RK3126 is an entry-level tablet processor introduced in Q4 2014. Manufactured using a 40 nm process, it features a quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU up to 1.3 GHz and a Mali-400 MP2 GPU.

It targets more fully featured tablets and set-top boxes.\n\n\n=== RK32xx series ===\nRockchip has announced the RK3288 for production in the second quarter of 2014. Recent information suggests that the chip uses a quad-core ARM Cortex-A17 CPU, although technically ARM Cortex-A12, which as of October 1, 2014, ARM has decided to also refer to as Cortex-A17 because the latest production version of Cortex-A12 performs at a similar performance level as Cortex-A17.\n28 nm HKMG process.\nQuad-core ARM Cortex-A17, up to 1.8 GHz\nQuad-core ARM Mali-T760 MP4 (also incorrectly called Mali-T764) GPU clocked at 600 MHz supporting OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0/3.0/3.1, OpenCL 1.1, Renderscript, Direct3D 11.1\nHigh performance dedicated 2D processor\n1080P video encoding for H.264 and VP8, MVC\n4K H.264 and 10 bits H.265 video decode, 1080p multi-video decode\nSupports 4Kx2K H.265 resolution\nDual-channel DDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR2, LPDDR3\nUp to 3840x2160 display output, HDMI 2.0\n\n\n==== Inconsistent information about CPU cores used in RK3288 ====\nEarly reports including Rockchip first suggested in summer 2013 that the RK3288 was originally designed using a quad-core ARM Cortex-A12 configuration. Rockchip's primary foundry partner GlobalFoundries announced a partnership with ARM to optimize the ARM Cortex-A12 for their 28 nm-SLP process.  This is the same process used for earlier Rockchip chips such as the RK3188, and matches the choice of Cortex-A12 cores in the design of the RK3288.\nIn January 2014, official marketing materials listed the CPU cores as ARM Cortex-A17. At the CES electronics show in January 2014, someone apparently corrected the CPU specification as being ARM Cortex-A12 instead of Cortex-A17 on one of the panels of their show booth. However, since then, official specifications from Rockchip's website and marketing materials as well specifications used by device manufacturers have continued to describe the CPU as a quad-core ARM Cortex-A17.\nRecent testing of early RK3288-based TV boxes (August/September 2014) provided evidence that the RK3288 technically contains Cortex-A12 cores, since the \"ARM 0xc0d\" CPU archtitecture reported by CPU-Z for Android is the reference for Cortex-A12, while the original Cortex-A17 is referred to as \"ARM 0xc0e\".However, on the ARM community website, ARM clarified the situation on October 1, 2014, saying that Cortex-A12, for which Rockchip is one of the few known customers, will be called Cortex-A17 from now on, and that all references to Cortex-A12 have been removed from ARM's website. ARM explained that the latest production revision of Cortex-A12 now performs close to the level of Cortex-A17 because the improvements of the Cortex-A17 now also have been applied to the latest version of Cortex-A12. In this way, Rockchip now gets the official blessing from ARM for listing the cores inside the RK3288 as Cortex-A17.\nThe first Android TV stick based on RK3288 was launched in November 2014 (\"ZERO Devices Z5C Thinko\").\n\n\n=== RK33xx series ===\n\n\n==== RK3368 ====\nRockchip announced the first member of the RK33xx family at the CES show in January 2015. The RK3368 is a SoC targeting tablets and media boxes featuring a 64-bit octa-core Cortex-A53 CPU and an OpenGL ES 3.1-class GPU.\n64bits Octa-Core Cortex-A53, up to 1.5 GHz\nHigh-performance PowerVR SGX6110 GPU with support for OpenGL 3.1 and OpenGL ES 3.0\n4Kx2K H.264/H.265 real-time video playback\nHDMI 2.0 with 4Kx2K @ 60 fps display output\n\n\n==== RK3399 aka OP1 ====\nThe RK3399 aka OP1 announced by ARM at Mobile World Congress in February 2016, features six 64 bit CPUs, including 2 Cortex-A72 and 4 Cortex-A53. The RK3399 is used for the development of the open source Panfrost driver for ARM Mali GPU Midguard series. \u00b7 RK3399Pro is a version including a 2.4 TOPS NPU.Consumer devices include:\n\nAsus Chromebook Flip C101PA-DB02\nAsus Chromebook Tablet CT100\nSamsung Chromebook Plus\nPinebook ProSBC include:\n\n96Boards RK1808\nFirefly RK3399\nKhadas Edge\nLenovo Leez LP710\nNanoPi M4B\nRock Pi 4\nRock Pi N10\nPine64 RockPro64\nPine64 RockPro64-AI,\nOrange Pi 4\nToybrick RK3399Pro\nZidoo M9SOM:\n\nBeiQi RK3399Pro AIoT (Compatible 96boards)\nBoardcon PICO3399 SO-DIMM\nGeniatech SOM3399 RK3399 (Compatible 96boards)\n\n\n=== RK35xx series ===\n\n\n==== RK3566 ====\nThe RK3566 is expected to be available in Q2 2020\nCPU \u2013 Quad-core Arm Cortex-A55 @ 1.8 GHz\nGPU \u2013 Arm Mali-G52 2EE\nNPU \u2013 0.5 TOPS with support for INT8/ INT16\nMulti-Media\n8M ISP 2.0 with 3F HDR(Line-based/Frame-based/DCG)\nSupport MIPI-CSI2,4-lane\n1080p60 H.265, H.264 encoding\n4K H.264/H.265/VP9 60fps video decoder\nDVP interface with BT.656/BT.1120\nMemory \u2013 32-bit DDR3L/LPDDR3/DDR4/LPDDR4/LPDDR4X\nStorage \u2013 eMMC 4.51, NAND Flash, SFC NOR flash, SATA 3.0, SD card via SDIO\nDisplay\nSupport Dual Display\nMIPI-DSI/RGB interface\nLVDS/eDP/DP\nHDMI 2.0\nAudio \u2013 2x 8-ch I2S, 2x 2-ch I2S, PDM, TDM, SPDIF\nNetworking \u2013  2x RGMII interfaces (Gigabit Ethernet) with TSO (TCP segmentation offload ) network acceleration\nUSB \u2013 USB 2.0 OTG and USB 2.0 host; USB3.0 HOST\nOther peripherals\nPCIe\n3x SDIO 3.0 interface for Wi-Fi and SD card\n6x I2C, 10x UART, 4x SPI, 8x PWM, 2xCAN interface\n\n\n==== RK3588 ====\nThe RK3588 succeeds the RK3399Pro as flagship SoC.

To offer free downloads of SoC hardware documents and software development resources as well as third-party development kits info. The chipsets available are RK3399, RK3288, RK3328 and RK3036.\n\n\n== Markets and competition ==\nIn the market for SoCs for tablets, Rockchip faces competition with Allwinner Technology, MediaTek, Intel, Actions Semiconductor, Spreadtrum, Leadcore Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Broadcom, VIA Technologies and Amlogic.After establishing a position early in the developing Chinese tablet SoC market, in 2012 it faced a challenge by Allwinner. In 2012, Rockchip shipped 10.5 million tablet processors, compared to 27.5 million for Allwinner.\nHowever, for Q3 2013, Rockchip was forecast to ship 6 million tablet-use application processors in China, compared to 7 million for Allwinner who mainly shipped single-core products.\nRockchip was reported to be the number one supplier of tablet-use application processors in China in Q4 2013, Q1 2014 and Q2 2014.Chinese SoC suppliers that do not have cellular baseband technology are at a disadvantage compared to companies such as MediaTek that also supply the smartphone market as white-box tablet makers increasingly add phone or cellular data functionality to their products.Intel Corporation made investments into the tablet processor market, and was heavily subsidizing its entry into the low-cost tablet market as of 2014.\n\n\n=== Cooperation with Intel ===\nIn May 2014, Intel announced an agreement with Rockchip to jointly deliver an Intel-branded mobile SoC platform based on Intel's Atom processor and 3G modem technology. Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will deliver an Intel-branded mobile SoC platform. The quad-core platform will be based on an Intel Atom processor core integrated with Intel's 3G modem technology, and is expected to be available in the first half of 2015. Both Intel and Rockchip will sell the new part to OEMs and ODMs, primarily into each company's existing customer base.As of October 2014, Rockchip was already offering Intel's XMM 6321, for low-end smartphones. It has two chips:  a dual-core application processor (either with Intel processor cores or ARM Cortex-A5 cores) with integrated modem (XG632) and an integrated RF chip (AG620) that originates from the cellular chip division of Infineon Technologies (which Intel acquired some time ago). The application processor may also originate from Infineon or Intel. Rockchip has not earlier targeted the smartphone space in a material way.\n\n\n== List of Rockchip SoC ==\n\n\n=== ARMv7-A processors ===\n\n\n=== ARMv8-A processors ===\n\n\n=== Tablet processors with integrated modem ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Rockchip products\nRockchip RK3288\nChromebook\nList of applications of ARM cores\nARM Cortex-A53\nAllwinner Technology\nAmlogic\nActions Semiconductor\nLeadcore Technology\nMediaTek\nNufront\nSpreadtrum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRockchip Wiki Linux SDK\nGithub Rockchip-linux Website\nFuzhou Rockchip Electronics Company website\nRockchip Korea Company website \nRockchip Korea Company website \nRK3288 SoC specification, 22 February 2014\nRK3368 SoC specification, 19 April 2015",

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

In 1995, the Fuzhou Municipal Government decided to build Baiyi Electronic Information City, which covers 1.2 square kilometres (0.46 sq mi) in the zone, making it the lead electronic industrial zone in Fuzhou. The Administrative Commission of Mawei High-tech Park was set up in the zone in 1999. It covers an area of 5.6 square kilometres (2.2 sq mi), and is in the area between Gushan Channel and Mawei Channel, Jiangbin Road and Fuma Road.\nFuzhou Science and Technology ParkThe Fuzhou Science and Technology Park was established in 1988 and was approved to be a national-level zone by the State Council in 1991. The planned area is 5.5 square kilometres (2.1 sq mi) and is divided into 3 parts: the Mawei portion, the Cangshan portion, and the Hongshan portion. The main industries are electronics, information technology, and biotechnology. The zone is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) away from the China National Highway 316 and 41 kilometres (25 mi) away from the Fuzhou Changle International Airport.\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment AreaThe Fuzhou Taiwan Merchants Development Zone was approved to be established in May 1989 by the State Council.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built. It is located close to Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Fuzhou Port.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built. It is located close to Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Fuzhou Port. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, trading and distribution, automobile production/assembly, medical equipment and supplies, shipping/warehousing/logistics and heavy industry.\nFuzhou Export Processing ZoneThe Fuzhou Export Processing Zone was founded on June 3, 2005, with the approval of the State Council and enjoys all the preferential policies. It is located inside the Chang'an Investment Zone of the Fuzhou Economic and Technical Development Zone (FETDZ) with a planned land area of 1.14 square kilometres (0.44 sq mi).\nFuzhou Free Trade ZoneThe Fuzhou Free Trade Zone was established in 1992 by the State Council, with a planning area of 1.8 square kilometres (0.69 sq mi). Industries encouraged in the free trade zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, heavy industry, instruments & industrial equipment production, shipping/warehousing/logistics, telecommunications equipment, trading, and distribution.\nFuzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development ZoneThe Fuzhou High-tech Development Zone was set up in 1988 and approved by the State Council in March 1991. In 1995, the Fuzhou Municipal Government decided to build Baiyi Electronic Information City, which covers 1.2 square kilometres (0.46 sq mi) in the zone, making it the lead electronic industrial zone in Fuzhou. The Administrative Commission of Mawei High-tech Park was set up in the zone in 1999. It covers an area of 5.6 square kilometres (2.2 sq mi), and is in the area between Gushan Channel and Mawei Channel, Jiangbin Road and Fuma Road.\nFuzhou Science and Technology ParkThe Fuzhou Science and Technology Park was established in 1988 and was approved to be a national-level zone by the State Council in 1991. The planned area is 5.5 square kilometres (2.1 sq mi) and is divided into 3 parts: the Mawei portion, the Cangshan portion, and the Hongshan portion. The main industries are electronics, information technology, and biotechnology. The zone is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) away from the China National Highway 316 and 41 kilometres (25 mi) away from the Fuzhou Changle International Airport.\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment AreaThe Fuzhou Taiwan Merchants Development Zone was approved to be established in May 1989 by the State Council. The zone is located in the Fuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. The zone is a commercial base for Taiwan-related development. The current area is 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). The main industries are IT, metallurgy, food processing, and textiles.

Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built. It is located close to Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Fuzhou Port. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, trading and distribution, automobile production/assembly, medical equipment and supplies, shipping/warehousing/logistics and heavy industry.\nFuzhou Export Processing ZoneThe Fuzhou Export Processing Zone was founded on June 3, 2005, with the approval of the State Council and enjoys all the preferential policies. It is located inside the Chang'an Investment Zone of the Fuzhou Economic and Technical Development Zone (FETDZ) with a planned land area of 1.14 square kilometres (0.44 sq mi).\nFuzhou Free Trade ZoneThe Fuzhou Free Trade Zone was established in 1992 by the State Council, with a planning area of 1.8 square kilometres (0.69 sq mi). Industries encouraged in the free trade zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, heavy industry, instruments & industrial equipment production, shipping/warehousing/logistics, telecommunications equipment, trading, and distribution.\nFuzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development ZoneThe Fuzhou High-tech Development Zone was set up in 1988 and approved by the State Council in March 1991. In 1995, the Fuzhou Municipal Government decided to build Baiyi Electronic Information City, which covers 1.2 square kilometres (0.46 sq mi) in the zone, making it the lead electronic industrial zone in Fuzhou. The Administrative Commission of Mawei High-tech Park was set up in the zone in 1999. It covers an area of 5.6 square kilometres (2.2 sq mi), and is in the area between Gushan Channel and Mawei Channel, Jiangbin Road and Fuma Road.\nFuzhou Science and Technology ParkThe Fuzhou Science and Technology Park was established in 1988 and was approved to be a national-level zone by the State Council in 1991. The planned area is 5.5 square kilometres (2.1 sq mi) and is divided into 3 parts: the Mawei portion, the Cangshan portion, and the Hongshan portion. The main industries are electronics, information technology, and biotechnology. The zone is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) away from the China National Highway 316 and 41 kilometres (25 mi) away from the Fuzhou Changle International Airport.\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment AreaThe Fuzhou Taiwan Merchants Development Zone was approved to be established in May 1989 by the State Council. The zone is located in the Fuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. The zone is a commercial base for Taiwan-related development. The current area is 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). The main industries are IT, metallurgy, food processing, and textiles.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built. It is located close to Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Fuzhou Port. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, trading and distribution, automobile production/assembly, medical equipment and supplies, shipping/warehousing/logistics and heavy industry.\nFuzhou Export Processing ZoneThe Fuzhou Export Processing Zone was founded on June 3, 2005, with the approval of the State Council and enjoys all the preferential policies. It is located inside the Chang'an Investment Zone of the Fuzhou Economic and Technical Development Zone (FETDZ) with a planned land area of 1.14 square kilometres (0.44 sq mi).\nFuzhou Free Trade ZoneThe Fuzhou Free Trade Zone was established in 1992 by the State Council, with a planning area of 1.8 square kilometres (0.69 sq mi). Industries encouraged in the free trade zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, heavy industry, instruments & industrial equipment production, shipping/warehousing/logistics, telecommunications equipment, trading, and distribution.\nFuzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development ZoneThe Fuzhou High-tech Development Zone was set up in 1988 and approved by the State Council in March 1991. In 1995, the Fuzhou Municipal Government decided to build Baiyi Electronic Information City, which covers 1.2 square kilometres (0.46 sq mi) in the zone, making it the lead electronic industrial zone in Fuzhou. The Administrative Commission of Mawei High-tech Park was set up in the zone in 1999. It covers an area of 5.6 square kilometres (2.2 sq mi), and is in the area between Gushan Channel and Mawei Channel, Jiangbin Road and Fuma Road.\nFuzhou Science and Technology ParkThe Fuzhou Science and Technology Park was established in 1988 and was approved to be a national-level zone by the State Council in 1991. The planned area is 5.5 square kilometres (2.1 sq mi) and is divided into 3 parts: the Mawei portion, the Cangshan portion, and the Hongshan portion. The main industries are electronics, information technology, and biotechnology. The zone is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) away from the China National Highway 316 and 41 kilometres (25 mi) away from the Fuzhou Changle International Airport.\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment AreaThe Fuzhou Taiwan Merchants Development Zone was approved to be established in May 1989 by the State Council. The zone is located in the Fuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. The zone is a commercial base for Taiwan-related development. The current area is 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). The main industries are IT, metallurgy, food processing, and textiles.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

        "wiki": "Multiple ethnic groups populate China, the area claimed by both the People's Republic of China (China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan).\nThe Han (\u6c49) people are the largest ethnic group in mainland China. In 2010, 91.51% of the population were classified as Han (~1.2 billion). Besides the Han Chinese majority, 55 other ethnic (minority) groups are categorized in present China, numbering approximately 105 million people (8%), mostly concentrated in the bordering northwest, north, northeast, south and southwest but with some in central interior areas.\nThe major minority ethnic groups in China are Zhuang (16.9 million), Hui (10.5 million), Manchu (10.3 million), Uyghur (10 million), Miao (9.4 million), Yi (8.7 million), Tujia (8.3 million), Tibetan (6.2 million), Mongol (5.9 million), Dong (2.8 million), Buyei (2.8 million), Yao (2.7 million), Bai (1.9 million), Korean (1.8 million), Hani (1.6 million), Li (1.4 million), Kazakh (1.4 million) and Dai (1.2 million). At least 126,000 people from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China. There are also undistinguished ethnic groups, for example: Chuanqing people (\u7a7f\u9752\u4eba).\n\n\n== Ethnic groups recognized by the People's Republic of China ==\n\nThe following are the 56 ethnic groups (listed by population) officially recognized by the People's Republic of China (39 in 1954; 54 by 1964; with the most recent addition the Jino people in 1979).\nAGB 3304\uff0d91 \"Names of ethnicities of China in romanization with codes\";BThe population only includes mainland China and Taiwan;CFor ethnic groups officially recognised in 1964 or earlier, this is the year of first inclusion in the national census, which were in 1954 and 1964;1Also included are the Chuanqing;2Also includes Utsuls of Hainan, descended from Cham refugees;3A subset of which is also known as Hmong (Thus, Hmong peoples worldwide are NOT only Miao);4including Amdowa and Khampa, as well as roughly half of Pumi speakers, the remainder of whom are classified as a separate Pumi ethnicity;5Also known as Kam;6Also included are the Sangkong;7This category includes several different Tai-speaking groups historically referred to as Bai-yi [in fact, the Dai nationalities are actually speakers of Shan languages varieties -for example : Tai Lue and Tai Nuea peoples are actually Shan peoples subgroups]. Although that, the speakers of Bumang are also included in this Dai nationality.  ;8Also included are the Mosuo;9Also included are the Qago (\u6728\u4f6c\u4eba);10Known as Kachin in Myanmar;11Also included are the Then;12Actually not Tajik people but Pamiri people;13The same group as Vietnamese or Kinh people in Sino-Vietnamese;14Known as Palaung in Myanmar;15The same group as Nanai on the Russian side of the border;16A collective name for all Taiwanese aborigine groups in Taiwan.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.

The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built.

It is located inside the Chang'an Investment Zone of the Fuzhou Economic and Technical Development Zone (FETDZ) with a planned land area of 1.14 square kilometres (0.44 sq mi).\nFuzhou Free Trade ZoneThe Fuzhou Free Trade Zone was established in 1992 by the State Council, with a planning area of 1.8 square kilometres (0.69 sq mi). Industries encouraged in the free trade zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, heavy industry, instruments & industrial equipment production, shipping/warehousing/logistics, telecommunications equipment, trading, and distribution.\nFuzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development ZoneThe Fuzhou High-tech Development Zone was set up in 1988 and approved by the State Council in March 1991. In 1995, the Fuzhou Municipal Government decided to build Baiyi Electronic Information City, which covers 1.2 square kilometres (0.46 sq mi) in the zone, making it the lead electronic industrial zone in Fuzhou. The Administrative Commission of Mawei High-tech Park was set up in the zone in 1999. It covers an area of 5.6 square kilometres (2.2 sq mi), and is in the area between Gushan Channel and Mawei Channel, Jiangbin Road and Fuma Road.\nFuzhou Science and Technology ParkThe Fuzhou Science and Technology Park was established in 1988 and was approved to be a national-level zone by the State Council in 1991. The planned area is 5.5 square kilometres (2.1 sq mi) and is divided into 3 parts: the Mawei portion, the Cangshan portion, and the Hongshan portion. The main industries are electronics, information technology, and biotechnology. The zone is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) away from the China National Highway 316 and 41 kilometres (25 mi) away from the Fuzhou Changle International Airport.\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment AreaThe Fuzhou Taiwan Merchants Development Zone was approved to be established in May 1989 by the State Council.

These positions might have been used to protect the Haitan Strait, which was thought of as a favorable staging area for amphibious operations against the Matsu Islands.The site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List in 2001, under Haitan Scenic Spots, in the Mixed category (Cultural & Natural).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAdministratively, the island is part of Pingtan County, which includes several smaller islands and part of the nearby mainland. Most of the county's towns, including its seat of government at Tancheng, are on the island. Large areas of the island's coast have undergone land reclamation, along with major building and infrastructure projects.\nPingtan is separated from mainland China by the Haitan Strait. Most of the nearby mainland is the county-level city of Fuqing, administered as part of the prefecture-level city of Fuzhou. \nPingtan is separated from Taiwan Island by the Taiwan Strait. Following the completion of its bridge to the mainland in 2010, Pingtan may be considered the closest part of the Chinese \"mainland\" to Taiwan Island.\nUnder current international agreement, the island's southernmost extremity forms the boundary between the East and South China Seas. In the still-unapproved draft of the new edition of the IHO's Limits of Oceans and Seas, Cape Xiang\u2014the northernmost extremity of the island\u2014forms the boundary between the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, with the South China Sea having its northern boundary moved to the south end of the strait.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe island relies on tourism and anticipates that foreign investment will spur economic growth. The first major bridge to cross the Haitan Strait was completed in November 2010, connecting the island to Fuqing on the mainland. Spanning 4,976 meters, it cost 1.4 billion RMB (about US$200 million) to build.An 88.5-km-long Fuzhou-Pingtan Railway (the Fuping Railway,  \u798f\u5e73\u94c1\u8def), connecting \nFuzhou to Pingtan Island, via Changle and a series of bridges, is under construction. The project was approved in November 2012. It was expected that the work would start by the end of the year, and would take about five and a half years.In early 2012, it was announced that a large cloud computing center would be built in Pingtan.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nA 430,000-square-foot (40,000 m2) museum, the Pingtan Art Museum, is currently under construction in the island. The museum, designed by the Chinese-American firm MAD Studio on an artificial island, is scheduled for completion in 2016.\n\n\n== Maps ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of islands of Fujian\nNiushan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nUNESCO World Heritage Centre: tentative Haitan Scenic Spots World Heritage Site",

        "wiki": "Fujian (\u798f\u5efa; alternately romanized as Fukien or Hokkien Province) is a province on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Fujian is bordered by Zhejiang to the north, Jiangxi to the west, Guangdong to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the east. Its capital is Fuzhou, while its largest city by population is Xiamen, both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province. The name Fujian originated from the combination of the city names of Fuzhou and nearby Jianzhou (present-day Nanping) during the Tang dynasty.\nWhile its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. Historically the dialects of the language group Min Chinese were most commonly spoken within the province, including the Hokkien dialects of southeastern Fujian. This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province's name (\u95fd). Hakka Chinese is also spoken, by the Hakka people in Fujian. Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with Mandarin Chinese. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines speak Southern Min (or Hokkien).\nAs a result of the Chinese Civil War, Historical Fujian is now divided between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan), and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administrative divisions. The majority of the territory of historical Fujian (the mainland territory and a few islands) currently make up the Fujian province of the PRC. The Fujian province of the ROC constitutes to two counties (Kinmen and Lienchiang), which consist of three offshore archipelagos namely the Kinmen Islands, the Matsu Islands and the Wuqiu Islands.\nWith a population of 39 million, Fujian ranks 17th in population among Chinese provinces. Its GDP is CN\u00a53.58 trillion, ranking 10th in GDP. Along with its coastal neighbours Zhejiang and Guangdong, Fujian's GDP per capita is above the national average, at CN\u00a592,830. It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric Fujian ===\nRecent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the Neolithic Age by the middle of the 6th millennium BC. From the Keqiutou site (7450\u20135590 BP), an early Neolithic site in Pingtan Island located about 70 kilometres (43 mi) southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, shells, bones, jades, and ceramics (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with spinning wheels, which is definitive evidence of weaving.\nThe Tanshishan (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71) site (5500\u20134000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and Chalcolithic Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun (\u9ec3\u571f\u5d19) site (ca.1325 BC), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the Bronze Age in character.\nTianlong Jiao (2013) notes that the Neolithic appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.\nThere were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal Zhejiang.\nKeqiutou culture (\u58f3\u4e18\u5934\u6587\u5316; c. 6000\u20135500 BP, or c. 4050\u20133550 BC)\nTanshishan culture (\u6619\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316; c. 5000\u20134300 BP, or c. 3050\u20132350 BC)\nDamaoshan culture (\u5927\u5e3d\u5c71\u6587\u5316; c. 5000\u20134300 BP)\nHuangguashan culture (\u9ec4\u74dc\u5c71\u6587\u5316; c. 4300\u20133500 BP, or c. 2350\u20131550 BC)There were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures. These are the Niubishan culture (\u725b\u9f3b\u5c71\u6587\u5316) from 5000\u20134000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture (\u846b\u82a6\u5c71\u6587\u5316) from 2050 to 1550 BC.\n\n\n=== Minyue kingdom ===\n\nFujian was also where the kingdom of Minyue was located. The word \"M\u01d0nyu\u00e8\" was derived by combining \"M\u01d0n\" (simplified Chinese: \u95fd; traditional Chinese: \u95a9; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: b\u00e2n), which is perhaps an ethnic name (simplified Chinese: \u86ee; traditional Chinese: \u883b; pinyin: m\u00e1n; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: b\u00e2n), and \"Yu\u00e8\", after the State of Yue, a Spring and Autumn period kingdom in Zhejiang to the north. This is because the royal family of Yu\u00e8 fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the State of Chu in 306 BC. M\u01d0n is also the name of the main river in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.\n\n\n=== Qin dynasty ===\nLi Si, the famous prime minister of Qin, deposed the king of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery. Minyue was a de facto kingdom until one of the emperors of the Qin dynasty, the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.\n\n\n=== Han dynasty ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the Qin dynasty's fall, civil war broke out between two warlords, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the Han dynasty. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue's status as a tributary independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in Fuzhou as well as a few locations in the Wuyi Mountains, which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern Guangdong, eastern Jiangxi, and southern Zhejiang.After Wuzhu's death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the Han dynasty as it expanded southward. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a military campaign against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.\nFujian was part of the much larger Yang Province (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (\u6b77\u967d; present-day He County, Anhui).\nThe Han dynasty collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the Three Kingdoms era. Sun Quan, the founder of the Kingdom of Wu, spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.\n\n\n=== Jin era ===\nThe first wave of immigration of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the Western Jin dynasty collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in central China: Lin (\u6797), Huang (\u9ec4), Chen (\u9648), Zheng (\u90d1), Zhan (\u8a79), Qiu (\u90b1, He (\u4f55, and Hu (\u80e1. The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian.Nevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the \"barbarian\" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two commanderies and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.\nDuring the Southern and Northern Dynasties era, the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang (Western Liang), and Chen) reigned south of the Yangtze River, including Fujian.\n\n\n=== Sui and Tang dynasties ===\n\nDuring the Sui and Tang eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian. The area did not become Sinicized until this time.During the Sui dynasty, Fujian was again part of Yang Province.\nDuring the Tang, Fujian was part of the larger Jiangnan East Circuit, whose capital was at Suzhou. Modern-day Fujian was composed of around 5 prefectures and 25 counties.\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian's culture and economy. Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to northern part of Fujian.\n\n\n=== Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms ===\nAs the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by General Wang, who set up an independent Kingdom of Min with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon absorbed by Southern Tang, another southern kingdom.Parts of northern Fujian were conquered by the Wuyue Kingdom to the north as well, including the Min capital Fuzhou.\nQuanzhou city was blooming into a seaport under the reign of the Min Kingdom and was the largest seaport in the world. For a long period of time its population was also greater than Fuzhou.Qingyuan Jiedushi was a military/governance office created in 949 by Southern Tang's second emperor Li Jing for the warlord Liu Congxiao, who nominally submitted to him but controlled Quan (\u6cc9\u5dde, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) and Zhang (\u6f33\u5dde, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures in de facto independence from the Southern Tang state.  (Zhang Prefecture was, at times during the circuit's existence, also known as Nan Prefecture (\u5357\u5dde).)  Starting in 960, in addition to being nominally submissive to Southern Tang, Qingyuan Circuit was also nominally submissive to Song, which had itself become Southern Tang's nominal overlord.\n\nAfter Liu's death, the circuit was briefly ruled by his biological nephew/adoptive son Liu Shaozi, who was then overthrown by the officers Zhang Hansi and Chen Hongjin.  Zhang then ruled the circuit briefly, before Chen deposed him and took over.  In 978, with Song's determination to unify Chinese lands in full order, Chen decided that he could not stay de facto independent, and offered the control of the circuit to Song's Emperor Taizong, ending Qingyuan Circuit as a de facto independent entity.\n\n\n=== Song dynasty ===\nThe area was reorganized into the Fujian Circuit in 985, which was the first time the name \"Fujian\" was used for an administrative region.Fujian or Guangxi was the origin of the ethnic Chinese Tran who migrated to Vietnam along with a large number of other Chinese, during the Vietnamese Ly dynasty, where they served as officials. Distinctly Chinese last names are found in the Tran and Ly dynasty Imperial exam records. Ethnic Chinese are recorded in Tran and Ly dynasty records of officials. Clothing, food, and language were all Chinese dominated in Van Don where the Tran had moved after leaving their home province of Fujian. The Chinese language could still be spoken by the Tran in Vietnam. The side of Vietnam that borders the ocean was colonized by Chinese migrants from Fujian. This included the Tran among them who settled in the capital's southeastern area. The Red River Delta was subjected to migration of people from different provinces all over China through Fujian's major city port. The Tran and Van Don port arose as a result of this interaction. Fujian and Guangdong Chinese moved to the Van Don coastal port during Ly Anh Tong's rule to engage in commerce. The usurpation of the Ly occurred after they married with the fishing Fujianese Tran family.In 1172 Fujian was attacked by Pi-she-ye pirates from Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Yuan dynasty ===\nAfter the establishment of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, Fujian became part of Jiangzhe province, whose capital was at Hangzhou. From 1357-1366 Muslims in Quanzhou rebelled in the Ispah Rebellion, advancing northward and even capturing Putian and Fuzhou before the rebellion was crushed by the Yuan. Afterwards, Quanzhou city lost foreign interest of trading and its formerly welcoming international image as the foreigners were all massacred or deported.\nYuan dynasty General Chen Youding, who had put down the Ispah Rebellion, continued to rule over the Fujian area even after the outbreak of the Red Turban Rebellion. Forces loyal to eventual Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang (Hongwu Emperor) defeated Chen in 1367.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty ===\nAfter the establishment of the Ming dynasty, Fujian became a province, with capital at Fuzhou. In the early Ming era, Quanzhou was the staging area and supply depot of Zheng He's naval expeditions. Further development was severely hampered by the sea trade ban, and the area was superseded by nearby ports of Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai despite the lifting of the ban in 1550. Large-scale piracy by Wokou was eventually wiped out by Chinese military and Japanese authority of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.An account of Ming dynasty Fujian was written by No In \u9c81\u8ba4.The Pisheya appear in Quanzhou Ming era records.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nThe late Ming and early Qing dynasty symbolized an era of large influx of refugees and another 20 years of sea trade ban under the Kangxi Emperor, a measure intended to counter the refuge Ming government of Koxinga in the island of Taiwan.\nThe sea ban implented by the Qing forced many people to evacuate the coast in order to deprive Koxinga's Ming loyalists of resources. This has led to the myth that it was because Manchus were \"afraid of water\".\nIncoming refugees did not translate into a major labor force, owing to their re-migration into prosperous regions of Guangdong. In 1683, the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan in the Battle of Penghu and annexed it into the Fujian province, as Taiwan Prefecture. Settlement of Taiwan by Han Chinese followed. Today, most Taiwanese are descendants of Hokkien people from Southern Fujian. Fujian arrived at its present extent after Taiwan was developed into an independent province (Fujian-Taiwan-Province) starting in 1885. Just ten years later, the Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan via the Treaty of Shimonoseki after losing the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nThe Xinhai revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty brought the province into the rule of the Republic of China.\nFujian briefly gained independence from China again under the Fujian People's Government until it was recontrolled by Republic of China.\nIt came under Japanese sea blockade during World War II.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nFujian's slow development in its early days has proved a blessing for the province's ecology; today, the province has the highest forest coverage rate and the most diverse biosphere in China whereas central China suffers from severe overpopulation and displays severe signs of soil erosion, with frequent droughts and floods due to lack of forest coverage.Development has been accompanied by a large influx of population from the overpopulated areas in the north and west, and much of the farmland and forest, as well as cultural heritage sites such as the temples of king Wuzhu, have given way to ubiquitous high-rise buildings. Fujian faces challenges at all levels to sustain development while at the same time preserving Fujian's natural and cultural heritage.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe province is mostly mountainous and is traditionally said to be \"eight parts mountain, one part water, and one part farmland\" (\u516b\u5c71\u4e00\u6c34\u4e00\u5206\u7530). The northwest is higher in altitude, with the Wuyi Mountains forming the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. It is the most forested provincial-level administrative region in China, with a 62.96% forest coverage rate in 2009. Fujian's highest point is Mount Huanggang in the Wuyi Mountains, with an altitude of 2,157 metres (1.340 mi).\nFujian faces East China Sea to the east, South China Sea to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the southeast. The coastline is rugged and has many bays and islands. Major islands include Quemoy (also known as Kinmen) (controlled by the Republic of China), Haitan Island, and Nanri Island. Meizhou Island occupies a central place in the cult of the goddess Matsu, the patron deity of Chinese sailors.\nThe Min River and its tributaries cut through much of northern and central Fujian. Other rivers include the Jin and the Jiulong. Due to its uneven topography, Fujian has many cliffs and rapids.\nFujian is separated from Taiwan by the 180 kilometres (110 mi)-wide Taiwan Strait. Some of the small islands in the Taiwan Strait are also part of the province. The islands of Quemoy and Matsu are under the administration of the Republic of China.\nFujian contains several faults, the result of collision between the Asiatic Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The Changle-Naoao and Longan-Jinjiang fault zones in this area have annual displacement rates of 3\u20135 mm. They could cause major earthquakes in the future.Fujian has a subtropical climate, with mild winters. In January, the coastal regions average around 7\u201310 \u00b0C (45\u201350 \u00b0F) while the hills average 6\u20138 \u00b0C (43\u201346 \u00b0F). In the summer, temperatures are high, and the province is threatened by typhoons coming in from the Pacific. Average annual precipitation is 1,400\u20132,000 millimetres (55\u201379 in).\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nAs of 2012, there are 54,876 kilometres (34,098 miles) of highways in Fujian, including 3,500 kilometres (2,200 miles) of expressways. The top infrastructure projects in recent years have been the Zhangzhou-Zhaoan Expressway (US$624 million) and the Sanmingshi-Fuzhou expressway (US$1.40 billion). The 12th Five-Year Plan, covering the period from 2011 to 2015, aims to double the length of the province's expressways to 5,500 kilometres (3,400 mi).\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nDue to Fujian's mountainous terrain and traditional reliance on maritime transportation, railways came to the province comparatively late. The first rail links to neighboring Jiangxi, Guangdong and Zhejiang Province, opened respectively, in 1959, 2000 and 2009.  As of October 2013, Fujian has four rail links with Jiangxi to the northwest: the Yingtan\u2013Xiamen Railway (opened 1957), the Hengfeng\u2013Nanping Railway (1998), Ganzhou\u2013Longyan Railway (2005) and the high-speed Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway (2013).  Fujian's lone rail link to Guangdong to the west, the Zhangping\u2013Longchuan Railway (2000), will be joined with the high-speed Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen Railway (Xiashen Line) in late 2013.  The Xiashen Line forms the southern-most section of China's Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen sections of this corridor entered operation in 2009 and links Fujian with Zhejiang with trains running at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph).\nWithin Fujian, coastal and interior cities are linked by the Nanping\u2013Fuzhou (1959), Zhangping\u2013Quanzhou\u2013Xiaocuo (2007) and Longyan\u2013Xiamen Railways, (2012).  To attract Taiwanese investment, the province intends to increase its rail length by 50 percent to 2,500 km (1,553 mi).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe major airports are Fuzhou Changle International Airport, Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport, Quanzhou Jinjiang International Airport, Nanping Wuyishan Airport, Longyan Guanzhishan Airport and Sanming Shaxian Airport. Xiamen is capable of handling 15.75 million passengers as of 2011. Fuzhou is capable of handling 6.5 million passengers annually with a cargo capacity of more than 200,000 tons. The airport offers direct links to 45 destinations including international routes to Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe People's Republic of China controls most of the province and divides it into nine prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city):\n\nAll of the prefecture-level cities except Nanping, Sanming, and Longyan are found along the coast.\nThese nine prefecture-level cities are subdivided into 85 county-level divisions (28 districts, 13 county-level cities, and 44 counties). Those are in turn divided into 1,107 township-level divisions (605 towns, 328 townships, 18 ethnic townships, and 156 subdistricts).\nThe People's Republic of China claims five of the six townships of Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan) as a county of the prefecture-level city of Quanzhou.The PRC claims Wuqiu Township, Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan) as part of Xiuyu District of the prefecture-level city of Putian.\nFinally, the PRC claims Matsu Islands (Lienchiang County), Republic of China (Taiwan) as a township of its Lianjiang County, which is part of the prefecture-level city of Fuzhou.\nTogether, these three groups of islands make up the Republic of China's Fujian Province.\n\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nList of the Secretaries of the CPC Fujian Committee\n\nZhang Dingcheng (\u5f20\u9f0e\u4e1e): June 1949 \u2013 October 1954\nYe Fei (\u53f6\u98de): October 1954 \u2013 June 1958\nJiang Yizhen (\u6c5f\u4e00\u771f): acting 1958\u20131970\nHan Xianchu (\u97e9\u5148\u695a): April 1971 \u2013 December 1973\nLiao Zhigao (\u5ed6\u5fd7\u9ad8): December 1974 \u2013 February 1982\nXiang Nan (\u9879\u5357): February 1982 \u2013 March 1986\nChen Guangyi (\u9648\u5149\u6bc5): March 1986 \u2013 December 1993\nJia Qinglin (\u8d3e\u5e86\u6797): December 1993 \u2013 October 1996\nChen Mingyi (\u9648\u660e\u4e49): October 1996 \u2013 December 2000\u3000\nSong Defu (\u5b8b\u5fb7\u798f): December 2000 \u2013 February 2004\nLu Zhangong (\u5362\u5c55\u5de5): February 2004 \u2013 November 2009\nSun Chunlan (\u5b59\u6625\u5170): November 2009 \u2013 December 2012\nYou Quan (\u5c24\u6743): December 2012 \u2013 October 2017\nYu Weiguo (\u4e8e\u4f1f\u56fd): October 2017 \u2013 presentList of Governors\n\nZhang Dingcheng (\u5f20\u9f0e\u4e1e): August 1949 \u2013 October 1954 \u3000\nYe Fei (\u53f6\u98de): October 1954 \u2013 January 1959\nJiang Yizhen (\u6c5f\u4e00\u771f): October 1959 \u2013 December 1962\nWen Jinshui (\u9b4f\u91d1\u6c34): December 1962 \u2013 August 1968\u3000\nHan Xianchu (\u97e9\u5148\u695a): August 1968 \u2013 December 1973\nLiao Zhigao (\u5ed6\u5fd7\u9ad8): November 1974-December 1979\nMa Xingyuan (\u9a6c\u5174\u5143): December 1979 \u2013 January 1983\nHu Ping (\u80e1\u5e73): January 1983 \u2013 September 1987\nWang Zhaoguo (\u738b\u5146\u56fd): September 1987 \u2013 November 1990\nJia Qinglin (\u8d3e\u5e86\u6797): November 1990 \u2013 April 1994\nChen Mingyi (\u9648\u660e\u4e49): April 1994 \u2013 October 1996\nHe Guoqiang (\u8d3a\u56fd\u5f3a): October 1996 \u2013 August 1999\nXi Jinping (\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73): August 1999 \u2013 October 2002\nLu Zhangong (\u5362\u5c55\u5de5): October 2002 \u2013 December 2004\nHuang Xiaojing (\u9ec4\u5c0f\u6676): December 2004 \u2013 April 2011\nSu Shulin (\u82cf\u6811\u6797): April 2011 \u2013 November 2015\nYu Weiguo (\u4e8e\u4f1f\u56fd): November 2015 \u2013 January 2018\nTang Dengjie (\u5510\u767b\u6770): January 2018 \u2013 present\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFujian is one of the more affluent provinces with many industries spanning tea production, clothing and sports manufacturers such as Anta, 361 Degrees, Xtep, Peak Sport Products and Septwolves. Many foreign firms have operations in Fujian. They include Boeing, Dell, GE, Kodak, Nokia, Siemens, Swire, TDK and Panasonic.\nIn terms of agricultural land, Fujian is hilly and farmland is sparse. Rice is the main crop, supplemented by sweet potatoes and wheat and barley. Cash crops include sugar cane and rapeseed. Fujian leads the provinces of China in longan production, and is also a major producer of lychees and tea. Seafood is another important product, with shellfish production especially prominent.\nBecause of the geographic location with Taiwan, Fujian has been considered the battlefield frontline in a potential war between mainland China and Taiwan. Hence, it received much less investment from Chinese central government and developed much slower than the rest of China before 1978. Since 1978, when China opened to the world, Fujian has received significant investment from overseas Fujianese around the world, Taiwanese and foreign investment. Today, although Fujian is one of the wealthier provinces of China, its GDP per capita is only about the average of China's coastal administrative divisions.See also List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita\nMinnan Golden Triangle which includes Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou accounts for 40 percent of the GDP of Fujian province.\nFujian province will be the major economic beneficiary of the opening up of direct transport with Taiwan which commenced on December 15, 2008. This includes direct flights from Taiwan to major Fujian cities such as Xiamen and Fuzhou. In addition, ports in Xiamen, Quanzhou and Fuzhou will upgrade their port infrastructure for increased economic trade with Taiwan.Fujian is the host of China International Fair for Investment and Trade annually. It is held in Xiamen to promote foreign investment for all of China.\nIn 2011, Fujian's nominal GDP was 1.74 trillion yuan (US$276.3 billion), a rise of 13 percent from the previous year. Its GDP per capita was 46,802 yuan (US$7,246 (9th)).By 2015 Fujian expects to have at least 50 enterprises that have over 10 billion RMB in annual revenues.  The government also expects 55 percent of GDP growth to come from the industrial sector.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\n\nDongshan Economic and Technology Development Zone\nFuzhou Economic & Technical Development Zone\nFuzhou Free Trade Zone\nFuzhou Hi-Tech Park\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment Area\nJimei Taiwan Merchant Investment Area\nMeizhou Island National Tourist Holiday Resort\nWuyi Mountain National Tourist Holiday Resort\nXiamen Export Processing Zone\nXiamen Free Trade Zone\nXiamen Haicang Economic and Technological Development Zone\nXiamen Torch New & Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (Chinese version)\nXinglin Taiwan Merchant Investment Area\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 1832, the province was described as having an estimated \"population of fourteen millions.\"Han Chinese make up 98% of the population. Various Fujianese peoples (Min-speaking groups) make up the largest subgroups of Han Chinese in Fujian. This includes the Hoklo people, Fuzhounese people, Teochew people and Putian people.\nHakka, a Han Chinese people with its own distinct identity, live in the southwestern parts of the province bordering Guangdong. Hui'an, also a Han branch with their distinct culture and fashion, populate Fujian's southeast coastline near Chongwu in Hui'an County.  The She, scattered over mountainous regions in the north, is the largest minority ethnic group of the province.Many ethnic Chinese around the world, especially in Southeast Asia, trace their ancestries to the Fujianese branches of Hoklo people and Teochew people. Descendants of Southern Min speaking emigrants make up the predominant majority ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. While Eastern Min speaking people, especially Fuzhounese people, is one of the major sources of China immigrants in the United States, especially since the 1990s.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Fujian are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 31.31% of the population believes and is involved in Chinese ancestral religion, while 3.5% of the population identifies as Christian. The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; 65.19% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects, and small minorities of Muslims.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBecause of its mountainous nature and the numerous waves of migration from north and central China in the course of history, Fujian is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse places in all ethnic Chinese areas of China. Local dialects can become unintelligible within 10 kilometres (6.2 mi), and the regional cultures and ethnic composition can be completely different from each other as well. This is reflected in the expression that \"if you drive five miles in Fujian the culture changes, and if you drive ten miles, the language does\". Most varieties spoken in Fujian are assigned to a broad Min category. Early classifications, such as those of Li Fang-Kuei in 1937 and Yuan Jiahua in 1960, divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups. More recent classifications subdivide Min into\nSouthern Min, including the Amoy dialect and Taiwanese\nPu-Xian, spoken in central coastal areas\nEastern Min (the former Northern group), including the Fuzhou dialect\nNorthern Min, spoken in inland northern areas\nCentral Min, spoken in the west of the province\nShao-Jiang, spoken in the northwest(The seventh subdivision of Min, Qiong Wen, is not spoken in Fujian.) Hakka, another subdivision of spoken Chinese, is spoken around Longyan by the Hakka people who live there.\nAs is true of other provinces, the official language in Fujian is Mandarin, which is used for communication between people of different localities, although native Fujian peoples still converse in their native languages and dialects respectively.\nSeveral regions of Fujian have their own form of Chinese opera. Min opera is popular around Fuzhou; Gaojiaxi around Jinjiang and Quanzhou; Xiangju around Zhangzhou; Fujian Nanqu throughout the south, and Puxianxi around Putian and Xianyou County.\n\nFujian cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood, is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine. It is composed of traditions from various regions, including Fuzhou cuisine and Min Nan cuisine. The most prestigious dish is Fotiaoqiang (literally \"Buddha jumps over the wall\"), a complex dish making use of many ingredients, including shark fin, sea cucumber, abalone and Shaoxing wine (a type of Chinese alcoholic beverage).\nMany well-known teas originate from Fujian, including oolong, Wuyi Yancha, Lapsang souchong and Fuzhou jasmine tea. Indeed, the tea processing techniques for three major classes tea, namely, oolong, white tea and black tea were all developed in the province. Fujian tea ceremony is an elaborate way of preparing and serving tea. In fact, the English word \"tea\" is borrowed from Hokkien of the Min Nan languages. (Mandarin and Cantonese pronounce the word ch\u00e1.)\nFuzhou bodiless lacquer ware, a noted type of lacquer ware, is noted for using a body of clay and/or plaster to form its shape; the body later removed. Fuzhou is also known for Shoushan stone carvings.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nFujian is home to a number of tourist attractions, including four UNESCO World Heritage Sites, one of the highest in China.\nIn the capital of Fuzhou is the Yongquan Temple, a Buddhist temple built during the Tang dynasty.\nThe Wuyi Mountains was the first location in Fujian to be listed by UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 1999. They are a mountain range in the prefecture of Nanping and contains the highest peak in Fujian, Mount Huanggang. It is famous as a natural landscape garden and a summer resort in China.\nThe Fujian Tulou are Chinese rural dwellings unique to the Hakka in southwest Fujian. They were listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 2008.\nGulangyu Island, Xiamen, is notable for its beaches, winding lanes and rich architecture. The island is on China's list of National Scenic Spots and is classified as a 5A tourist attraction by the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA). It was listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Site in 2017. Also in Xiamen is the South Putuo Temple.\nThe Guanghua Temple is a Buddhist temple in Putian. It was built in the penultimate year of the Southern Chen Dynasty. Located in the northern half of the mouth of Meizhou Bay, it is about 1.8 nautical miles from the mainland and faces the Strait of Taiwan to the southeast. Covering an area of six square miles, the island is swathed in luxuriant green foliage. The coastline is indented with over 12 miles of beach area. Another buddhist temple, Nanshan Temple is located in Zhangzhou.\nAround Meizhou Islands is the Matsu pilgrimage.\nThe Kaiyuan Temple, is a Buddhist temple in West Street, Quanzhou, the largest in Fujian province with an area of 78,000 square metres (840,000 square feet). Although it is known as a both a Hindu and Buddhist temple, on account of added Tamil-Hindu influences, the main statue in the most important hall is that of Vairocana Buddha, the main Buddha according to Huayan Buddhism.\nMount Taimu is a mountain and a scenic resort in Fuding. It offers a grand view of mountain and sea, and is famous for its natural scenery including granite caves, odd-shaped stones, steep cliffs, clear streams, cascading waterfalls, and cultural attractions such as ancient temples and cliff Inscriptions.\nThe Danxia landform in Taining was listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 2010. It is a unique type of petrographic geomorphology found in China. Danxia landform is formed from red-coloured sandstones and conglomerates of largely Cretaceous age. The landforms look very much like karst topography that forms in areas underlain by limestones, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called \"pseudo-karst\" landforms. They were formed by endogenous forces (including uplift) and exogenous forces (including weathering and erosion).\n\n\n== Notable individuals ==\nThe province and its diaspora abroad also has a tradition of educational achievement and has produced many important scholars, statesmen and other notable people since the time of the Song dynasty, such as:\n\nCai Jing (1047\u20131126), government official and calligrapher who lived during the Northern Song dynasty\nLi Gang (1083\u20131140), a politician and general serving during the transition from the Northern Song to the Southern Song dynasty\nZhu Xi (1130\u20131200), Confucian philosopher\nHuang Senping (14th\u201315th century), royal son-in-law of Sultan Muhammad Shah of Brunei\nZhang Jing (1492\u20131555), Ming dynasty politician and general\nYu Dayou (1503\u20131579), Ming dynasty general and martial artist\nHuang Daozhou (1585\u20131646), Ming dynasty politician, calligrapher and scholar\nIngen (1592\u20131673), well known Buddhist monk, poet and calligrapher who lived during Ming Dynasty\nHong Chengchou (1593\u20131665), Ming dynasty official\nShi Lang (1621\u20131696), Qing dynasty admiral\nKoxinga (1624\u20131662), Ming dynasty general who expelled the Dutch from Taiwan\nLin Zexu (1785\u20131850), Qing dynasty scholar and official\nZhan Shi Chai (1840s\u20131893), entertainer as \"Chang the Chinese giant\"\nHuang Naishang  (1849\u20131924), scholar, revolutionary, discovered the town of Sibu in Sarawak, east Malaysia in 1901\nLin Shu (1852\u20131924), translator\nYan Fu (1854\u20131921), scholar and translator\nSa Zhenbing (1859\u20131952), high-ranking naval officer of Mongolian origin\nZheng Xiaoxu (1860\u20131938), statesman, diplomat and calligrapher\nLin Changmin(zh:\u6797\u9577\u6c11) (1876\u20141925), a high-rank governor in the Beiyang Government\nLin Juemin (1887\u20131911), one of 72 Revolutionary Martyrs at Huanghuagang, Guangzhou\nLin Yutang (1894\u20131976), writer\nZheng Zhenduo (1898\u20131958), literary historian\nOng Schan Tchow (Chinese: \u7fc1\u5360\u79cb) (1900\u20131945), artist well known for the painting of the \u201cBook of Chrysanthemums\u201d\nJos\u00e9 Rizal (1861\u20131896), National Hero of the Philippines whose lineage is from Fujian\nBing Xin (1900\u20131999), writer\nLin Huiyin (1904\u20131955), architect and writer\nTsai Chi-Kun (1912\u20132004), \"father of the Taiwan Symphony\"\nGo Seigen (1914\u20132014), pseudonym of Go champion W\u00fa Q\u012bngyu\u00e1n\nLiem Sioe Liong (1916\u20132012), a Chinese-born Indonesian businessman of Fuqing origin, founder of Salim Group\nChih-Tang Sah (born 1932), well-known electronics engineer of Mongolian origin\nLiu Yudong (born 1970), professional basketball player\nShi Zhiyong (born 1980), professional weightlifter\nLin Dan (born 1983), professional badminton player\nJeremy Lin (born 1988), professional basketball player\nWang Zhelin (born 1994), professional basketball player\n\n\n== Sports ==\nFujian includes professional sports teams in both the Chinese Basketball Association and the Chinese League One.\nThe representative of the province in the Chinese Basketball Association are the Fujian Sturgeons, who are based in Jinjiang, Quanzhou.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built. It is located close to Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Fuzhou Port. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, trading and distribution, automobile production/assembly, medical equipment and supplies, shipping/warehousing/logistics and heavy industry.\nFuzhou Export Processing ZoneThe Fuzhou Export Processing Zone was founded on June 3, 2005, with the approval of the State Council and enjoys all the preferential policies. It is located inside the Chang'an Investment Zone of the Fuzhou Economic and Technical Development Zone (FETDZ) with a planned land area of 1.14 square kilometres (0.44 sq mi).\nFuzhou Free Trade ZoneThe Fuzhou Free Trade Zone was established in 1992 by the State Council, with a planning area of 1.8 square kilometres (0.69 sq mi). Industries encouraged in the free trade zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, heavy industry, instruments & industrial equipment production, shipping/warehousing/logistics, telecommunications equipment, trading, and distribution.\nFuzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development ZoneThe Fuzhou High-tech Development Zone was set up in 1988 and approved by the State Council in March 1991. In 1995, the Fuzhou Municipal Government decided to build Baiyi Electronic Information City, which covers 1.2 square kilometres (0.46 sq mi) in the zone, making it the lead electronic industrial zone in Fuzhou. The Administrative Commission of Mawei High-tech Park was set up in the zone in 1999. It covers an area of 5.6 square kilometres (2.2 sq mi), and is in the area between Gushan Channel and Mawei Channel, Jiangbin Road and Fuma Road.\nFuzhou Science and Technology ParkThe Fuzhou Science and Technology Park was established in 1988 and was approved to be a national-level zone by the State Council in 1991. The planned area is 5.5 square kilometres (2.1 sq mi) and is divided into 3 parts: the Mawei portion, the Cangshan portion, and the Hongshan portion. The main industries are electronics, information technology, and biotechnology. The zone is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) away from the China National Highway 316 and 41 kilometres (25 mi) away from the Fuzhou Changle International Airport.\nFuzhou Taiwan Merchant Investment AreaThe Fuzhou Taiwan Merchants Development Zone was approved to be established in May 1989 by the State Council. The zone is located in the Fuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. The zone is a commercial base for Taiwan-related development. The current area is 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). The main industries are IT, metallurgy, food processing, and textiles. The zone is 11.5 kilometres (7.1 mi) away from the 316 National Highway and 52 kilometres (32 mi) away from Fuzhou Changle International Airport.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n\n\n=== Historical / cultural ===\nSanfang Qixiang (\u4e09\u574a\u4e03\u5df7) \"Three Lanes and Seven Alleys\" is a cluster of ancient residential buildings dating from the late Jin dynasty now features a pedestrian zone with shops along the street.

        "wiki": "Fuzhou, alternately romanized as Foochow, is the capital and one of the largest cities in Fujian province, China. Along with the many counties of Ningde, those of Fuzhou are considered to constitute the Mindong (lit. Eastern Fujian) linguistic and cultural area.\nFuzhou lies on the north (left) bank of the estuary of Fujian's largest river, the Min River. All along its northern border lies Ningde, and Ningde's Gutian County lies upriver. Its population was 7,115,370 inhabitants as of the 2010 census, of whom 4,408,076 inhabitants are urban representing around 61.95%, while rural population is at 2,707,294 representing around 38.05%. In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution.\nFuzhou is listed as No. 20 in China\nIntegrated City Index 2016's total ranking, a study conducted by National Development and Reform Commission.\n\n\n== Names ==\nFuzhou in Chinese is \"\u6709\u798f\u4e4b\u5dde\" (y\u01d2uf\u00fazh\u012bzh\u014du), meaning \"a city with good luck.\" The Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou's name came from Mount Futo, a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain's name was then combined with -zhou, meaning \"settlement\" or \"prefecture,\" in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as Ye (Chinese: \u51b6), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city's name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname Rongcheng (Chinese: \u6995\u57ce; Foochow Romanized: \u1e72\u0300ng-si\u00e0ng), lit.: 'The Banyan City'.\nIn older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, F\u016btsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC) ===\n\nThe remains of two Neolithic cultures\u2014the Huqiutou Culture (\u864e\u4e18\u982d\u6587\u5316), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshi Mountain Culture (\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316), from around 3000 BC\u2014have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475\u2013221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (\u95a9\u8d8a), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min watershed near Wuyishan City.\n\n\n=== Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC\u2013AD 206) ===\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into \"Commanderies\" (Chinese: \u90e1; pinyin: j\u00f9n)\u2014roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture\u2014and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (\u95a9\u4e2d\u90e1). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (\u7121\u8af8; Old Chinese: Matya) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (\u51b6; Old Chinese: Lya; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.\nIn 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the Han\u2013Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.\n\n\n=== Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200\u2013618) ===\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area began to shift to the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).\n\n\n=== Tang to the ten kingdoms era (618\u2013960) ===\nIn 725, the city was formally renamed \"Fuzhou\". Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.\nFuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by the citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.\n\n\n=== Song era (960\u20131279) ===\nFuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song Dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations zh:\u72b6\u5143), a large number for a small city in the country during that dynasty.\nThe Hualin Temple (\u83ef\u6797\u5bfa, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls \u2013 more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.\nMarco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as Fugiu. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.\nAccording to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\nBetween 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.\nThe Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644-1912) ===\nIn 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China's failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou's Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained H\u00fc King Eng.On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nOn November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.\n\n\n==== Revolutionary Republic ====\nOn November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Army set up the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.\n\n\n==== Japanese occupation ====\nWith the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass the Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats Fu-Ning, Chen-Ning and Suming defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship Chu-Tai berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy's Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (date unknown), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941\u20131944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941\u20131944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942. and the British scientist Dr Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.\nIn The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War 2, the Japanese intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of the Japanese re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until the surrender of Japan and its armed forces in China in September 1945.\nFollowing the restitution of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nFuzhou was occupied by People's Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949.In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People's Liberation Army.Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nFuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian Monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 10.9 \u00b0C (51.6 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 19.84 \u00b0C (67.7 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.9 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 25 January 2016 to 41.7 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2003.\nSnow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: H\u00f3k-chi\u0103ng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Di\u00f2ng-l\u014f\u0324h) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of \"5 districts and 8 counties\" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.\nThe city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe City of Banyans is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast\n\n\n=== Language and art ===\nBesides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhou dialect (\u798f\u5dde\u8a71), the prestige form of Eastern Min.\nMin opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou dialect is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as \"Making Seal\", \"The Purple Jade Hairpin\" and \"Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi\".\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.\nApart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.\nThe origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel Journey to the West was issued in Ming dynasty.\nAs the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d).\n\n\n=== Local cuisine ===\n\nFuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as xianwei (simplified Chinese: \u9c9c\u5473; traditional Chinese: \u9bae\u5473; pinyin: xi\u0101nw\u00e8i), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine (\u798f\u5efa\u8001\u9152).\nFuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks.  Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (\u9b5a\u4e38), meat-pastry dumplings (\u6241\u8089\u71d5), rice scroll soup (\u9f0e\u908a\u7cca), gong pian (\u5149\u9905; a kind of mildly savoury pastry), and pork floss (\u8089\u9b06).  Many of these street food dishes have a long history; for example, rice scroll soup became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty.  As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S..  For example, one is able to find gong pian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York's Chinatown.\nFuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays.  For example, red and white rice cakes (\u5e74\u7cd5) are served over Chinese New Year, stuffed yuanxiao (\u5143\u5bb5) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi (\u7cbd\u5b50) during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.\n\n\n=== Special crafts ===\nBodiless lacquerware (\u812b\u80ce\u6f06\u5668), paper umbrellas and horn combs (\u89d2\u68b3) are the \"Three Treasures\" of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures (\u8edf\u6728\u756b) and Shoushan stone sculptures (\u58fd\u5c71\u77f3\u96d5) are called \"Three Superexcellences\" of Fuzhou.\n\n\n== Media ==\nFuzhou Evening News (\u798f\u5dde\u665a\u62a5), Strait News (\u6d77\u5ce1\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5) and Southeast Express (\u4e1c\u5357\u5feb\u62a5) are the three most primary newspapers in the city. Fuzhou Daily (\u798f\u5dde\u65e5\u62a5) is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Communist Party of China. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing & Distributing Group also headquarter here.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nFuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian.  The Wenzhou\u2013Fuzhou and Fuzhou\u2013Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). \nThe Hefei\u2013Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph).\nThe Nanping\u2013Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway provide rail access inland.  The latter line can carry trains at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph).  The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nFuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province, has two metro lines in operation, the first line opened linking the south of the city and the north above the Min River, and five lines under construction.\n\nLine 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou Railway Station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.\nLine 2 runs in the east\u2013west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin'an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.\n\n\n=== Seaport ===\n\nPassenger liners regularly sail between ROC's Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland's closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== History of Fuzhou port ====\nIn 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China's first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854\u20131921).\nThe yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country's disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940\u201345.\nSince 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIndustry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China's \"open\" cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.\nIts GDP was \u00a575,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.\nFuzhou is undoubtedly the province's political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou's GDP amounted to \u00a5228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou's exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city's trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) downstream.In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to \u00a5113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to \u00a533,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Zones ===\nFuzhou Economic & Technological Development ZoneThe Fuzhou Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in January 1985 by State Council, with a total planning area of 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) and now has 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) built. It is located close to Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Fuzhou Port.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Fuzhou Changle International Airport (IATA: FOC, ICAO: ZSFZ) is an international airport serving Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, China.  The airport was inaugurated on June 23, 1997, after being approved to start constructing in 1992.  The current handling capacity is approximately 6.5 million people annually.\nThe airport is located near the shore of the Taiwan Strait in Zhanggang Subdistrict, Changle, about 50 km (31 mi) east of Fuzhou's city center.\nIn 2017, Fuzhou Airport handled 12,469,235 passengers and was 29th busiest in China by total passenger traffic. In 2016 the airport was the 23rd busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic and the 28th busiest airport by traffic movements.\n\n\n== History ==\nChangle Airport was built to replace the old Fuzhou Yixu Airport (\u798f\u5dde\u4e49\u5e8f\u673a\u573a), a dual-use military and civil airport located in Cangshan District, and prepared for the base of the direct flights to Taiwan across the straits. The airport was designed by Singaporean RSP Architects Planners & Engineers Pte Ltd. The government of Fujian province hoped that the new airport could reach the standard of Singapore Changi Airport, but they soon realized it was too big, and shrank the scale of the airport. However, the scale of the airport was still much bigger than the norm that central government approved. Changle Airport was opened in 1997. Due to the lack of Passenger flow, the airport had a great deficit in early years of operation. In 2003, the management of the airport was taken over by Xiamen International Airport Group, and began profiting from 2005.\nIn February 2017, Xiamen Airlines operated Changle's first direct route to North America, with a Boeing 787-9 service to New York\u2013JFK airport. On the 11th December 2018, a second intercontinental route to Paris was  launched.\n\n\n=== Future expansion ===\nIn September 2019, the National Development and Reform Commission  approved for airport phase two expansion project. The project includes the following construction works:\n\nConstruction of a 3600m x 60m second runway and relevant taxiway.\nConstruction of a 255,000m2 second terminal.\nConstruction of 60 new aircraft stands, eight cargo aircraft stands and relevant supporting facilities.\nConstruction of second air traffic control tower and new 9000m2 air traffic management centre.\nReconstruction of existing air traffic control tower and air traffic management centre.The airport targets 36 million passengers and 450,000 tonnes cargo per year by 2030 upon project completion.\n\n\n== Location ==\nFuzhou Changle International Airport is located at 25\u00b056\u00b4 north latitude and 119\u00b039\u00b4 east longitude. It is surrounded by the sea on three sides. The surrounding area of the airport is flat, but it extends southwest and northeast, surrounded by mountains.\n\n\n== Traffic ==\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\nThere is a taxi waiting at the exit of the arrival hall. The city's unified price starts at 10 yuan / 3 kilometers, and 2 yuan per kilometer thereafter.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nThe airport passenger terminal has a number of fixed shuttle routes to Fuzhou City and surrounding areas, opening hours from 4:30-22:30.\n\n\n=== Highway ===\nThere are many expressways that can directly reach Changle International Airport, such as Shenhai Expressway, Fuyin Expressway, and Airport Expressway.\n\n\n=== Subway ===\nAccording to the newly released intercity railway construction plan for the west coast of Fujian Province, the Fuzhou-Changle Airport Intercity Railway (F1/3) will be directly connected to the airport, and will be passed by Metro Line 6 near the airport.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nFuzhou Changle International Airport has a subtropical maritime climate, with the northeast monsoon prevailing in the winter half year and the southwest monsoon in the summer half year. There will be continuous rainy weather in spring. Due to typhoon and subtropical high pressure, there are often strong winds and heavy rains in summer. There will be continuously sunny weather in winter.\nIn addition to the southerly winds in the south of July, Changle Airport is dominated by the northerly winds in the other 11 months, and there are mountain hills in the west of the Changle Plain.Typical climate characteristics of Changle Airport are: (1) , cloudy, low cloud base; (2) abundant rainfall, large number of rainy days; (3) fast wind speed, large number of windy days, and the annual average wind speed is 4.5 m/s (4) the airport has less thunderstorms, but the airport airspace has frequent thunderstorms (5)well marked sea-land breeze effect (6) humid air, the annual average relative humidity is 75%.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Delays ==\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\nIn 2017, the total throughput of Changle Airport ranked 28 in China, carrying passengers up to 12,469,235 throughout the year.\nIn the latest airport punctuality rate ranking in October 2018, Changle Airport ranked 16, which is 83.19%, with an average delay of 23 minutes. Delays of more than 60 minutes are rare, only 2.54%.\n\n\n=== Causes ===\n\n\n==== Thunderstorm ====\nAviation and weather are closely connected. Thunderstorms are currently recognized as one of the most important weather phenomena that seriously affect the safety of airport and efficiency of flights. When flying in thunderstorms area, passengers and crew may encounter dangerous weather such as wind shear, bumps, hail, downburst, etc.\nIn recent years, Fuzhou Changle International Airport has experienced a rapid growth for flight delays and return flight due to thunderstorms. In 2016, the number of flights affected by thunderstorms at Changle Airport was 729, taking up 38.4% of the total number of flights affected by the weather. The annual average thunderstorm of Fuzhou Changle International Airport is 27.3d which is considerably frequent and has a greater impact on flight. Thunderstorms vary greatly from year to year, and thunderstorms may occur throughout the year. As the temperature rises, thunderstorms frequency begin to increase.\nThe main activity period of thunderstorms at Fuzhou Airport is from March to September. Thunderstorms appear most frequent in summer, with an average number of days of 13.5 days, accounting for 49.5 percent of the total number of thunderstorms in the year.\nCompared to other months of the year, the thunderstorms in June showed the highest number, with an average of 5.1d.

This is because the eastern part of the airport is the ocean, the west is the mountainous area, and the convection over the mountains is stronger than the ocean.\n\n\n==== Visibility ====\nThe average visibility in the first half of the year is less than 1000 meters. The number of days is significantly higher than that in the second half, accounting for 83% of the whole year. The visibility of the airport has obvious seasonal differences, showing the worst visibility in spring.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airports in China\nList of the busiest airports in China\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Adelaide Botanic Garden is a 51-hectare (130-acre) public garden at the north-east corner of the Adelaide city centre, in the Adelaide Park Lands. It encompasses a fenced garden on North Terrace (between the old Royal Adelaide Hospital site and the National Wine Centre) and behind it the Botanic Park (adjacent to the Adelaide Zoo). Work was begun on the site in 1855, with its official opening to the public on 4 October 1857.\nThe Adelaide Botanic Garden and adjacent State Herbarium of South Australia, together with the Wittunga and Mt Lofty Botanic Gardens, are administered by the Board of the Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium, a State Government statutory authority.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nFrom the first official survey carried out for the map of Adelaide, Colonel William Light intended for the planned city to have a \"botanical garden\". To this end, he designated a naturally occurring ait that had formed in the course of the River Torrens, in what is now the West Parklands. However attempts to establish a garden were abandoned owing to frequent flooding of the area. After second attempt had failed, the northern bank of the Torrens, opposite the present location of the Adelaide Zoo, was considered, and it was here in 1839 that John Bailey, an experienced gardener, made a third attempt, but no funding was offered.The South Australian Agricultural and Horticultural Society (formed 1842) and other groups continued to press for the creation of a public garden. The public were aware of the economic and scientific benefits of such a garden, already seen elsewhere in the British Empire. In 1854 the present site was recommended to the government by the Society and George William Francis (who had begun appealing to the Governor Sir Henry Young soon after his arrival in 1849 to establish the garden), and Francis was appointed superintendent of the garden in 1855.In January 1855 the Legislative Council finally approved the site. The land was held sacred by the Kaurna people as the red kangaroo dreaming (Tarndanyangga), but at that time it was being used as paddocks for police horses. Francis was responsible for establishing the perimeter, solving the flooding problems and landscaping North Terrace to blend well with the entrance to the garden. In October 1855 he presented his first progress report, including a plan of Regent\u2019s Park in London as an example of circular garden design that he thought could be adapted for Adelaide.Francis and his family moved into the superintendent's cottage in 1856, and the Garden was opened to the public on 4 October 1857. In 1860 the Botanic Garden Act was enacted, which established the Board of Governors, with Francis as Director. The site at that time included the present Botanic Garden, Botanic Park and Adelaide Zoo.A pagoda was built in 1863, and Francis established the first herbarium and botanical library in Adelaide in 1864, a rustic temple modelled on the Museum of Economic Botany at Kew Gardens in England, with the design imitating the Parthenon in Athens. Francis gave lectures in the lecture room there each Tuesday.Hakea francisiana, an Australian shrub that grows to 4 metres (13 ft), is named after him.After his retirement shortly before his death in 1865, Francis was succeeded by botanist Dr Moritz Richard Schomburgk, brother to the German naturalist Robert Hermann Schomburgk. He was a major advocate for the establishment of forest reserves in the increasingly denuded South Australian countryside.Schomburgk's successor, Dr M. W. Holtze I.S.O., did much to make the gardens more attractive to the general public.\n\n\n== Historic buildings ==\n\n\n=== Palm House ===\n\nThe Palm, or Tropical, House is a Victorian-era glasshouse located to the west of the main lake. It was designed by the German architect Gustav Runge (1822-1900) and imported from Bremen, Germany in 1875. It was opened in 1877 and was restored in 1995 and 2018. It is the second-oldest glasshouse in Australia, and the only known one of German manufacture from that period left in the world, all others having been destroyed during World War II. Originally housing tropical flora, due to corrosion problems, since the early 1990s it has held a collection of Malagasy arid flora.\n\n\n=== Santos Museum of Economic Botany ===\nThe Museum of Economic Botany is dedicated to the collection and interpretation of \"useful\" plants. It was established by Schomburgk in 1879. Described as \"the last purpose-built colonial museum in the world\", it is located within the gardens a short distance to the west of the Goodman Building. Built in Greek Revival style and opened in May 1881, the building and its interior was extensively restored during 2008\u201309. The restoration works were assisted by a grant from the Government of Australia for $1.125 million and sponsorship by South Australian oil and gas company, Santos. The sponsorship arrangement also included naming rights and a commitment to ongoing support of the museum's exhibition program. Much of the collection originally on display in 1881 was reinstated, including a collection of papier mache and stucco replicas of various fruits and fungi. A space for temporary exhibitions within the museum was created by Khai Liew Design. Displays of Aboriginal artefacts, a subject neglected by the original museum, were prepared in collaboration with the South Australian Museum.The museum is notable for the completeness of its preservation. The building, its interior decoration, showcases, collections and even many labels have survived from as early as 1865. The museum is on the Register of State Heritage Items, the Register of the City of Adelaide Heritage Items, and has been classified by the National Trust of Australia.\n\n\n=== Goodman Building and State Herbarium ===\nThe administrative headquarters of the Botanic Garden are located in the historic Goodman building, at the Hackney Road entrance on the eastern side of the gardens. This was built in 1909 as the headquarters of the Municipal Tramways Trust, and named for its longtime Chief Engineer and General Manager W. G. T. Goodman. The adjacent Tram Barn A has been converted to hold the State Herbarium.\n\n\n== Displays ==\n\nAmong other scientific and educational displays of native and international horticulture, the gardens hold one of the earliest propagated specimens of the Wollemi Pine tree, which was discovered as recently as 1994.\n\n\n=== Bicentennial Conservatory ===\n\nAs part of Adelaide's celebration of the Australian Bicentenary, the conservatory was constructed in 1987 and opened in late 1989. The building was designed by local architect Guy Maron and has won awards for its design, engineering and landscaping. It is 100 metres (328 ft) long, 47 metres (154 ft) wide and 27 metres (89 ft) high making it the largest single span conservatory in the southern hemisphere.\nThe conservatory originally housed at-risk or endangered tropical rainforest plants from northern Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and south Pacific Islands. However, in early 2012, a controversial decision was announced to remove tropical plants from the conservatory due to rising power costs. In April 2012, the entry fee to the conservatory was abolished, despite rising energy costs and budget cuts resulting in the building no longer being heated.\n\n\n=== Rose garden ===\nBegun in 1996, the National Rose Trial Garden is the first garden of its kind in Australia where roses are tested for their suitability for Australian climates. The garden is a joint venture between the Botanic Gardens of Adelaide, the National Rose Trial Society of Australia and the rose industry. It has been built on part of the former Municipal Tramways Trust Hackney Depot. Roses are planted in groups such as, noisette roses, bourbon roses, tea roses, ramblers, and perpetual roses. A trial is conducted over two growing seasons and all plants are treated equally with regard to horticultural practices. The roses are judged by a panel of 10 experienced rosarians who examine them and allocate points over the two growing seasons. The results are announced publicly at the end of the trial and the best performing roses receive an award.While in Adelaide in 2004, Sir Cliff Richard planted a rose named 'Sir Cliff Richard' in the Rose Garden surrounded by a small group of fans and rose enthusiasts. Sales of the rose support the Bone Growth Foundation.\n\n\n== First Creek Wetlands ==\nIn order to reduce the garden's reliance on potable water from the River Murray, a new wetlands system was constructed south of the Bicentennial Conservatory to hold stormwater diverted from First Creek. The wetlands form part of an aquifer storage and recovery system which is expected to have a usable capacity of 100 megalitres (22,000,000 imp gal) per year, enough to water the entire Botanic Garden. The project was launched in March 2011 and was opened in November 2013.One significant purpose of the wetlands is to educate the public on the importance of wetlands, and to showcase plants which may never otherwise have been encountered by visitors. The area accommodates about 20,000 plants, including many Australian natives. The 2.6-hectare (6.4-acre) site also features a trail of interpretive signage, tiered garden beds showcasing aquatic plants and three large ponds with reed-beds which support a diverse range of native wildlife.\n\n\n== Governance and funding ==\nThe Botanic Gardens of South Australia, which include Adelaide, Wittunga and Mount Lofty Botanic Gardens, and also the State Herbarium of South Australia, are administered by the Board of the Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium, a State Government statutory authority, based on the Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium Act 1978 and Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium Regulations 2007.Dr Lucy Sutherland was appointed as the Director in 2016.The gardens receives funding from the Government of South Australia, supplemented by sponsorship and community donations administered by the Adelaide Botanic Gardens Foundation. Funds are raised for the purposes of \"scientific research, education, acquisition and maintenance of living collections and for the long-term financial security of the Gardens.\" The Adelaide Botanic Gardens Foundation is the trustee of the not-for-profit Adelaide Botanic Gardens Foundation Fund.\n\n\n=== Sponsorship ===\nAs of 2019, the garden received support from \"program partners\" Santos and Electranet, an NFP and a private sponsor. There were also a number of supporting partners\".\n\n\n== Research publication ==\nThe State Herbarium of South Australia publishes an open-access, peer-reviewed scientific journal on behalf of the Board of the Botanic Gardens and State Herbarium, Swainsona (2017-, Volume 30-). This was previously published as Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens (1976-2016, Volumes 1-29). The journal has a focus on Australasian taxa.\n\n\n== New expansions ==\nThe demolition of a couple of non-heritage buildings in the old Royal Adelaide Hospital site has meant that parts of the garden need to be blocked for safety reasons. This land may be given back to the Botanic Gardens.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBotanic Park, Adelaide\nList of Adelaide parks and gardens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBotanic Gardens of South Australia Retrieved 29 June 2017.\nFriends of the Botanic Gardens of Adelaide Retrieved 12 September 2012\nAdelaide Botanic Garden annual reports\nJournal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens - homepage\nJournal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens - listing at JSTOR",

        "wiki": "The Adelaide Park Lands are the figure-eight of land spanning both banks of the River Torrens between Hackney and Thebarton and separating the City of Adelaide from the surrounding suburbia of greater Metropolitan Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. They were laid out by Colonel William Light in his design for the city, and originally consisted of 2,300 acres (930 ha) \"exclusive of 32 acres (13 ha) for a public cemetery\". One copy of Light's plan shows areas for a cemetery and a Post and Telegraph Store on West Tce, a small Government Domain and Barracks on the central part of North Tce, a hospital on East Tce, a Botanical Garden on the River Torrens west of North Adelaide, and a school and a storehouse southwest of North Adelaide.Over the years there has been constant encroachment on the park lands by the state government and others. Soon after their declaration in 1837, 370 acres (150 ha) \"were lost to 'Government Reserves'\". In 1902, The Herald noted that a total area of 489 acres (198 ha) had been taken from park lands. In 2018, the loss is about 230 hectares (570 acres).The part of the Park Lands not in the 'Government Reserves' have been managed and maintained by the Adelaide City Council since 1852, and since February 2007, the Adelaide Park Lands Authority has advised council and government.On 7 November 2008 the Federal Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, announced that the Adelaide Park Lands had been entered in the Australian National Heritage List as \"an enduring treasure for the people of South Australia and the nation as a whole\". In fact, large areas of the Adelaide Park Lands along the north side of the complete length of North Tce, and along the north side of Port Road from West Tce to the Thebarton Police Barracks, (in Parks 11, 12, 26 and 27), and also the rail reserves, (in Parks 25, 26 and 27), were excluded from the \"Adelaide Park Lands and City Layout National Heritage Place\" listing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAdelaide is a planned city, and the Adelaide Park Lands are an integral part of Colonel William Light's 1837 plan. Light chose a site spanning the River Torrens (known as Yatala by the local people), and planned the city to fit the topography of the landscape, \"on rising ground\".\nThe Emigration Regulations appearing in the South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register published in London on 18 June 1836 instructed that the site of the first town be divided into 1,000 sections of an acre each.In early 1837, William Light proposed to the Resident Commissioner James Hurtle Fisher that the figure-eight of open space, which Light later referred to as \"Adelaide Park\", be reserved as \"Park grounds\". Light drew up a plan that included 700 acres (2.8 km2) south of the River Torrens and 342 acres (1.38 km2) north of the river. In addition, he included 38 acres (0.15 km2) of city squares: Hindmarsh, Hurtle, Light, Whitmore and Wellington Squares (each comprising six acres), Victoria Square (eight acres), four one-acre Public Reserves (with frontages to Victoria Square), and 2,300 acres (9.3 km2) for the Park Lands.Adelaide's characteristic geometrical grid pattern is not unique: apart from earlier precedents going back to ancient Greece, it follows part of a series of rules created by Spanish planners for their colonial cities, known as the \"Law of the Indies\". They included the grid pattern with a main thoroughfare, centred around a main square. There are many historical precedents for five squares, including Philadelphia in America, designed in 1682 by surveyor Thomas Holme. There are however no records showing that Light deliberately copied any cities or rules for planning.In 1838 the Colonization Commissioners for South Australia authorised South Australia's Resident Commissioner to purchase the Adelaide Park Lands, and these instructions were carried out in South Australia in 1839.By 1839 the Park Lands were threatened by extensive timber cutting, rubbish dumping, brick-making, quarrying, squatting, and grazing. To check this, a body of special constables was instituted on 9 October 1839 by George Gawler and Superintendent Henry Inman. Inman appointed Nick Boys Bull (c.1800-1846), formerly a police sub-inspector, as Keeper of the Park Lands.  Bull led an initial team of six park rangers, most being convalescent migrants thrown on government support.  This dropped to two by 1840, then back to four by June 1841.  Pay and rations were provided by the police department.Since 1852, the areas of the Park Lands placed in the custodianship of the municipal corporation have been managed and maintained by the Adelaide City Council. Public use of the Park Lands was controlled by a ranger who patrolled the parks, regulating sporting and recreational activities in the parks and supervising the depasturing of stock grazing there.The Park Lands saw development during the 19th Century, for example the Adelaide Botanic Garden, hospital, South Australian Institute, Adelaide Oval, Victoria Park Racecourse. Extensive felling of trees, quarrying and dumping of rubbish continued, which combined to give the Park Lands an unsightly appearance. In the late 19th century John Ednie Brown, the government's Conservator of Forests, was commissioned by the City Council to prepare a blueprint for the beautification of the Park Lands. Brown presented his Report in 1880, but it was not acted upon until the turn of the 20th century when A.W. Pelzer became the City Gardener. Major progress was made in planting and landscaping the Park Lands during his tenure (1899\u20131932) and further improvements such as creation of new gardens and boating lakes were carried under the authority of W.C.D. Veale, the Town Clerk (1947\u20131965).In July 2007 the city centre and parklands were granted National Heritage Listing status. The first remarks on the assessor's report were: \"The Adelaide Park Lands and City Layout is a significant example of early colonial planning which has retained key elements of its historical layout for over one hundred and seventy years. The 1837 Adelaide Plan attributed to Colonel William Light and the establishment of Adelaide marks a significant turning point in the settlement of Australia.\"\n\n\n== Park Lands today ==\nIn the 2010s, about 25% of the Park Lands are the location of government, public and cultural buildings. Of the remaining approximately 700 hectares, many parts have been sculpted into planned gardens and playing fields. Some of the remainder is remnant or regenerated Adelaide Plains grasslands or grassy woodlands, of which 230 hectares have been designated and developed by the city council as areas for native fauna and flora. Developments in the early 2000s focused on maintenance and upgrading of recreational facilities, and removal of remnant grasslands and open grassy woodlands, particularly through urbanisation and the Greening of Adelaide tree planting and replacement programs.In the early 2000s there were proposals to redevelop Park16 (Victoria Park), with the construction of a grandstand to cater for the Clipsal 500 and horse racing events. Due to lobbying by local resident groups, the Adelaide Park Lands Preservation Association, the media and many residents of greater Adelaide, this plan was eventually rejected by the Adelaide City Council and subsequently no longer pursued by the South Australian Government.\nIn December 2006 the state government passed the Adelaide Park Lands Act 2005, which established the Adelaide Park Lands Authority and a series of statutory protections for the Park Lands.  At the time the Act was proclaimed, Premier Mike Rann announced that a major return of alienated Park Lands would be made at the western edge of the city. The area to be returned lies between Railway Terrace, Port Road and the railway lines.In 2011 Rann unveiled the plans for the return to Park Lands of 5.5 hectares of land at the west end of Park 25, occupied since 1879 by the Thebarton Water Depot. The land, which was treeless grasslands prior to European settlement, was developed and landscaped with more than 23,000 trees and shrubs as an 'urban forest'. It features indigenous species including native pine. In 2017\u20132018, land at the east end of Park 25 has been used by the South Australian Cricket Association for the development of the Karen Rolton Oval and associated facilities including car parking.\n\n\n== Parks ==\n\nAlthough it is a single park, for management purposes the Adelaide City Council has used the last two digits of survey sections as labels to identify smaller areas within the Adelaide Park Lands. In some, but not all, cases, roadways crossing over the Park Lands coincide with the survey section boundaries that gave rise to council's numbering (from \"Park 1\" to \"Park 29\"). The numbering, which starts in the North Park Lands (at the Adelaide Golf Links), and increases clockwise around the perimeter, was applied in September 1882.Some of the parks are more commonly known by a commemorative name (e.g. Rymill Park), but others, such as Park 10, are still known mostly by their number. \n\n\n=== Dual naming ===\nSince the Adelaide City Council drew up a Reconciliation Vision Statement in 1997, they committed to a dual naming project, working with Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi, a Kaurna language project run in collaboration with Kaurna advisors. The dual naming covers the city centre and North Adelaide, including the six public squares and Adelaide park lands. Erection of signs in each of the parks was completed on 30 June 2004, with some of the spellings being revised in the 2010s. Also at that time, the numbered parks that still had no English name were assigned one.Victoria Square, in the centre of Adelaide city, is now also known as Tarntanyangga. All 29 Parks around the city have been assigned a Kaurna name, and the River Torrens is now also named Karrawirra Parri. The renaming of 39 sites was finalised and endorsed by the council in 2012. The full list of square and park names, along with meanings and pronunciations, is available on the Council website.\n\n\n=== Park 1: Possum Park / Pirltawardli ===\n\nKaurna Park Name & translation: Pirltawardli \"possum place\" (Pirltawardli/Piltawodli - \"pilta\" = possum, and \"wodli\" = house or home.) 76 hectares. The name of the site has in the past been spelt Pilta-wodli or Piltawodlingga (in KWP\u2019s New Spelling 2010, Pirltawardli and Pirltawardlingga).Of an irregular shape, Possum Park / Pirltawardli wraps around the western end of North Adelaide in a vaguely crescent or banana shape. The southern and western boundaries are provided by War Memorial Drive, with Park 27 (which includes Bonython Park on the other side. The eastern boundary, from south to north, is formed by Montefiore Rd, the western end of North Adelaide (i.e. Strangways Terrace, Mills Tce and Barton Tce West) and Jeffcott Rd. The northern boundary is formed by Park Tce. It Contains the Adelaide Golf Links.\n\n\n==== Kaurna and missionary history ====\nThe history of Park 1 is bound up with that of Park 27 and Bonython Park, after a succession of Protectors of Aborigines first set up a \"Native Location\", of which elements moved between the north and south sides of the River Torrens.Bromley\u2019s Camp, the first of these, was established in April 1837 on the south side of the river by Captain Walter Bromley, the second interim Protector. He initially pitched his tent in the vicinity of the old Adelaide Gaol, on land on or near the present Bonython Park (also known as the \"Aborigines Location\" and later as the \"Old Location\").\nAfter a few weeks, Bromley moved camp to the north side of the river at the request of the Kaurna people, to the site known as Piltawodli (later revised to Pirltawardli), meaning \"possum place\" and also known as the \"Aboriginal Location\".  It was probably a campsite used by the Kaurna, and may have had some importance for ceremonies. This site is now within the area of the Par 3 golf course adjoining the North Adelaide Golf Links, and is marked by a memorial plaque at the carpark by the weir, erected on 26 May 2000.In October 1838 two German missionaries, Christian Teichelmann and Clamor Sch\u00fcrmann (and later Samuel Klose) arrived, setting themselves first up at the \"Old Location\" on the southern side, studying the Kaurna language and teaching in that language. This was the first mission in South Australia. In December 1839 Sch\u00fcrmann opened a school, supported by Governor George Gawler, which taught only in the Kaurna language, teaching the children to read and write in their language.In 1839 the school was moved across to the north side of the river to Pirtawardli. In August 1840, Klose took over the running of the school. The second interim Protector (1837\u20131839), William Wyatt was also involved in the running of the school and was a frequent visitor to Pirtawardli.However the whole site, including the school, was dismantled in July 1845, on the orders of Governor George Grey, who thought it best to take the children away from their parents, and a new \"Native School\" run by the government, which taught only in English, was established near what is now Kintore Avenue. (The Native School closed in 1851, with the remaining children taken to Poonindie Mission at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula).A few people continued to camp near the house of Klose, the only remaining missionary, at Pirltawardli. In 1846 the government build some brick sheds in part of this area, and also across the river behind the new Adelaide Gaol. One was for the \"Murray tribe\", who had moved to the area, and a smaller number of sheds for what was left of the \"Adelaide tribe\".\n\n\n==== Significance of Pirltawardli ====\nPirltawardli is still of great significance to Kaurna people, as well as non-Indigenous South Australians. Nearly all of the recorded language and early written records of Kaurna culture stem from this place, documented by the missionaries, who also shared their views on race relations in the new colony. The linguistic work of Teichelmann and Sch\u00fcrmann there had far-reaching effects, influencing later missionaries to teach in local languages, aiding the work of linguists, and laying the foundations for the 21st-century language revival of the Kaurna and also indirectly helping in the revival of other languages, after other missionaries and linguists had followed their example with other local languages.\n\n\n==== Records ====\nApart from the missionaries, other Europeans such as William Wyatt, William Williams, William Cawthorne and Matthew Moorhouse wrote about the \"Adelaide Tribe\" in their memoirs.William Williams was keeper of the Colonial Store at nearby Tininyawardli ( or Tinninyawodli), which was just south of where Strangways Terrace was built. He published a list of 377 Kaurna words, published in the Southern Australian on 15 May 1839 and republished in the South Australian Colonist in the following year.William Cawthorne, a frequent visitor and close friend of Kadlitpina (\"Captain Jack\"), loved the Kaurna Palti \"corroboree\" and their material culture, and was responsible for recording many names of artefacts. His Rough Notes on the Manners and Customs of the Natives, written in 1844, was published in the 1925-26 Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (SA Branch).Moorhouse, Protector from 1839 until 1857, lived at Piltawodli and worked closely with the missionaries. There is only one remaining page of his diary, containing several Kaurna songlines not recorded elsewhere, but much information has been gleaned from his reports and official correspondence.\n\n\n=== Park 2: Denise Norton Park / Pardipardinyilla ===\nPardipardinyilla 'swimming place' 17 hectaresDenise Norton was the first South Australian to represent Australia at the Olympic or Commonwealth Games \u2013 in the sport of swimming.Approximately square, the park is bounded by Fitzroy Tce (to the north), Prospect Rd (to the east), Barton Tce West (to the south) and Jeffcott Rd (to the west).\nThe Park provides a range of formal and informal facilities for cricket, swimming, tennis and family picnics. The north-west corner of the Park contains the Adelaide Aquatic Centre, picnic facilities and the Bush Magic playground. The remainder of the Park includes sporting facilities, open space and vegetation (designed and semi-natural landscapes).\n\nThe Adelaide Swimming Centre was relocated to this Park in 1968/9 to replace the old City Baths on the current site of the Festival Centre. It was renovated, enclosed and renamed Adelaide Aquatic Centre in 1985. It was renovated again in 1998.\nThe Bush Magic Play Park was designed in 1988, and is important as a precedent for the contemporary generation of play spaces around the Park Lands and metropolitan Adelaide. It was the first play park in SA to incorporate wheelchair access.\nSporting facilities, which are currently held under an annual licence to Blackfriars Priory School, include change rooms, five playing fields and four tennis courts. The licence covers an area of approximately 35% of the Park. The school has first right of use of these areas on weekday afternoons after school, and on Saturday mornings.\n\n\n=== Park 3: Yam Daisy Park / Kantarilla ===\nKantarilla 'kandara root place' 3.3 hectaresA small triangle bounded by Prospect Rd (west), Fitzroy Tce (north) and Main North Rd (east).\nContains open park.\n\n\n=== Park 4: Reservoir Park / Kangatilla ===\nKangatilla 'kangatta berry place' 9.4 hectaresApproximately pentagonal, bounded by O'Connell St (west), Main North Rd (north-west), Lefevre Rd (north-east and east) and Barton Tce East (south).\nContains open and wooded park, with SA Water facilities at the western end. The former Fitzroy Croquet Club was located in the northern corner of the Park, and there were two ovals in the middle of the Park. The main structure of the SA Water facilities is a State Heritage-listed earth-covered reservoir, dating from the 1870s, that stores and supplies water to Adelaide. Associated with this are a two-storey red brick pumping station, a small brick pumping station \"heavily painted in Brunswick green\", and an electricity sub-station.\n\n\n=== Park 5: Bragg Park / Ngampa Yarta ===\nNgampa Yarta 'ngampa root ground' In the late 1800s, Nobel Prize winners and University of Adelaide academics Sir William Henry Bragg and his son, Sir William Lawrence Bragg, lived nearby.Of irregular shape, the park is bounded by Robe Terrace (NE), Medindie Road (SE), Lefevre Road (W) and Main North Road (NW).\nContains two small ovals, surrounded by wooded park. There is also a Tree Planting Memorial, erected in 1982 by the North Adelaide Society, to recognise the community tree planting efforts in the locality.\n\n\n=== Park 6: Lefevre Park / Nantu Wama ===\nNantu Wama 'horse plain' or 'male grey kangaroo plain' One of Lefevre Park's borders is Lefevre Terrace; Sir J G Shaw-Lefevre (1797\u20131879), a British barrister, Whig politician and civil servant, was one of South Australia\u2019s colonisation commissioners.Roughly trapezoidal, the park is bounded by Robe Terrace (NNE), Kingston Terrace (SE), Lefevre Terrace (WSW) and Medindie Road (NW).\nContains open park, mainly used for horse agistment. There are three main paddocks, four feeding yards, five horse troughs, and a number of sandpits for the horses to roll in. There is a limit of 20 horses, and those licensed pay a weekly fee. (In 2005, the fee was $19.50 per week.) According to the adelaideparklands.com.au website, \"100,000 kg of horse manure is deposited by the resident horses on this park each year\".The open areas are surrounded by woodland. There is a playground on the western boundary (Lefevre Tce), one of the three Glover Playgrounds originally built in 1920, which also contains BBQ facilities and wide lawn spaces. The eastern third contains assorted playing fields, changing rooms, tennis courts and netball courts. Wilderness School holds a licence for eight tennis courts (also marked for netball), one cricket oval, two cricket practice nets, and three hockey/softball ovals. In 2005, there was also a green-painted brick structure with a flat roof, erected in the late 1960s, which \"appears to have an undefined purpose and use\".\n\n\n=== Park 7: The Olive Groves / Kuntingga ===\nKuntingga 'kunti root place' (Park 7)\n\n\n=== Park 8: The Olive Groves / Parngutilla ===\nParngutilla 'barngutta root place' (Park 8)Parks 7 and 8 are small and elongated parks, with a combined area of 4.7 hectares, separating the east end of lower North Adelaide from Gilberton, and contain heritage listed olive groves. They act effectively as an enlarged median strip, with the major ring route of Park Terrace (southbound) and Mann Road (northbound) traversing the perimeter of both parks.These parks were one of the first sites for the (European settlers) plantings of olives, and are the only section of the Park Lands that have kept the same use since the Council took over formal care of the Park Lands in the 1860s. The olive plantation is listed as a State Heritage Place.\n\n\n=== Park 9: Bundey's Paddock / Tidlangga ===\nTidlangga 'tidla root place' William Bundey (1826\u20131889) was the Mayor of Adelaide 1883-1886.A triangular shape, bounded by Mackinnon Parade (NE), Bundeys Road (S) and Hackney Road (W).\nContains assorted playing fields and changing rooms. An oval is licensed to Prince Alfred College on Saturday afternoons and Thursday evenings. In the past, contained a number of grass and bitumen tennis courts which have fallen into dis-repair and been removed.\n\n\n=== Park 10: Bulrush Park / Warnpangga ===\n\nWarnpangga 'bullrush root place' 19 hectaresBounded by War Memorial Drive, Bundey's Road, MacKinnon Road, MacKinnon Parade, Finnis and Frome Road.\nThe Park is dominated by a number of sporting ovals and associated facilities licensed to the University of Adelaide, including a tennis pavilion, a grandstand, and changing rooms.\nThe Park also contains:\n\nThe Adelaide Archery Club rooms, in the north eastern corner of the Park.\nThe University Loop, a well used 2.2 km (1.4 mi) gravel running track, which encircles part of the Park.\nThe Adelaide City Council Organic Recycling Depot/Nursery, (approx 1.6 hectares), comprising: an Office Building, 3 sheds, 6 glass houses, a shade house, and 6 propagating plant frames.\nThe Lower North Adelaide Soldiers\u2019 Memorial Garden, located in the north of the Park.\nA number of sculptures, located in 1994 on the edge of the River Torrens.\nA small playground\n\n\n=== Park 11: Mistletoe Park / Tainmuntilla ===\nTainmuntilla 'mistletoe place'A quite large piece of land bounded by the River Torrens (north), Hackney Rd (east), North Terrace (south),  and Frome Rd (west).

In 1987 a public meeting was held, which resulted in the formation of the Adelaide Parklands Preservation Association Inc, (APPA), which later corrected its name to Adelaide Park Lands Preservation Association Inc. Examples of such pressure and erosion are listed on APPA's \"Hot Topics\" page.An example of one such source of controversy is the Victoria Park racecourse and associated areas south-east of the city centre which have been used for motor racing events for short periods of each year. In 2008 these parts of the park lands were targeted for development, incurring opposition from members of the community. The proposed plans included construction of a permanent corporate facility to provide hospitality and spectator facilities to select groups at events such as the Adelaide 500 motor racing event.\nOn 30 August 2007 veteran Adelaide heritage consultant and conservation architect Ron Danvers said it was \"a myth\" that Adelaide's founding fathers created the parklands (sic) exclusively for open space, and that it was \"self-evident\" that Colonel William Light's 1837 plan of Adelaide envisaged development of facilities beyond the CBD. In a submission to the Adelaide City Council, Mr Danvers said the state Government's $55 million plan for a grandstand at Victoria Park for horse and motor racing was \"completely consistent with the founding principles for the city\". \"Under Light's direction, the intention to locate public facilities outside of the main street grid is beyond question\", he said in a report commissioned by developers KBR.Subsequently, numerous counter-arguments demonstrated the fallacies in those points of view, and the proposal was dropped.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Adelaide parks and gardens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Adelaide Park Lands Act 2005\".

          "A very average zoo, with not a lot happening. Some nice enclosures, but wasn't the most maintained zoo I've ever seen. We really only came to see the Panda's, and they do not disappoint!",
          "We love the Adelaide zoo, the fact that we can see animals that would be extinct if the zoo didn\u2019t have them, is marvellous. The keepers are the best and the volunteers are so helpful. Definitely a great day out after corona virus",
          "Beautiful compact zoo. The pandas are amazing. The kids farm animal enclosure is great for kids hands on experience.",
          "Despite arriving quite late in the day, we got there in time to see the tiger feed which was exceptional! The zoo is well kept and has lots of space. Loved walking through the chickens in the animal farm and seeing into the animal hospital. Overall lovely zoo visit and we got",
          "What a delight it was to spend the day here! Clean and tidy in every corner , animals engaging and so many helpful staff wandering. Kids loved the playground and interactive children's area. One of the better zoos we have visited.",
          "Certainly, the Adelaide Zoo does have attributes, as peaceful paths meander a garden with animals you won't see downtown exist with a low-energy effort. Wanting to see native wildlife, the zoo barely covered my desires. A few kangas lazily wandered their pen; the wombats were",
          "The animals were sleek and really well cared for. The staff were deservedly proud of the animals in their care. The Lions are particularly healthy and the Male is a bit of a ham presenting his best side. A must-see if in Adelaide and easy to get to on the Hop on Hop off bus",
          "Big zoo with lots to see. Well explained notices. Great for kids. Spent a good 2 hours there but could have stayed all day.",
          "A lovely day out , as it was 30 degrees there is plenty of very welcome shade. It is a pretty zoo and mostly the animals have plenty of space to move around. I was a bit disappointed that the giraffe enclosure was pretty sparse and basic. Having said that though the rest of the",
          "This zoo is amazing as its been around for many years with the backing of many famous animal people. It is the only place in Australia to see Pandas from China. It's a small city zoo so it has lots of very special places to visit. It's one of the nicest Zoos I have had the",
          "Went on the weekend with my husband. Beautiful day out. Love walking around the grounds. The birds are my favourite. Food is reasonably priced so we had lunch from the kiosk. Worth a visit to watch the upgrades complete.",
          "Best to go on Friday when hippo enclosure has been cleaned so you can see them underwater. Poor Brutus may not be with us much longer as he is 55 this year. Management need to have a better communicated plan for the future as big animals move to Monato. Should speak to the staff",
          "As with most Zoos, animals did not have enough room. Hippo looked distraught and Pandas were trying so hard to get out of their indoor enclosures, it was heartbreaking. Cafe was nice and best Fish and Chips ever!",
          "What a great little zoo! I\u2019d heard that compared to its earlier days I\u2019d be disappointed with the lack of animals but honestly I was pleasantly surprised at how many animals there were. The pandas and the lions were my favourite but the hippo, tiger, giraffe they\u2019re all worth a",
          "They are the only pandas in the Southern hemisphere. The zoo is very manageable. Sadly most of the animals didn't want to come out and say hello. We did get to see their darling colony of meerkats. They also have a pygmy hippo as well as a full sized on which was a gift from",
          "Fabulous experience! We did so much walking, love it plus Brutus! Would like to see perhaps more water stations to refill water bottles.",
          "My husband and I had a great day checking out the Adelaide Zoo on Saturday. The map was very useful and we think we got to check out all the areas of the zoo. I loved seeing Wang Wang (panda) in his enclosure along with my mum's favourite animal, the meerkats. We had an",
          "Enjoyed a nice visit to the Zoo,the Zoo has an extensive rage of animals,presented in a very relaxed and very clean environment.We have seen a few Zoo,s and would say this one is up with the best of them.Very well set out and quite animal friendly,a nice place to visit.",
          "Very little to see . Penguins were the highlight.If you are in need of some food and drinks be warned that the kiosks tend to close early.Very poor choices",
          "Lovely well maintained zoo walking at your own pace.lots to see plenty of shade.well situated zoo where you can get the bus or tram or you can walk from Rundle street.",
          "Great zoo with loads to see. The giant pandas were amazing to see. The bird show was very good as well, lots of knowledge from the keepers. Really good value for money.",
          "Very nice zoo. Large range of animals, endemic or not. Birds are fun to see in their aviary. We spend only 3 hours as it was closing time. 5 hours should have been better.",
          "I visited the Zoo on the 25th January and did the Panda and Friends tour, where we got to see the Red Panda's and the Giant Panda's being fed breakfast before the crowds arrived and then a guided tour before being able to enjoy the Zoo on our own. Seeing the Red Panda's closer",
          "We recently visited the zoo and even though it is well stocjed with animals found it extremely pricy. You would have thought that the council would subsidy it.",
          "Was a amazing day with my Partner, Aunt and Cousin as always the zoo was interesting and many animals to see I always thoroughly enjoy going to the zoo. 10/10 recommend",
          "The tour was excellent, and included vastly more than we expected. We not only saw the panda's before the zoo opened, but our guide took us around the whole zoo and taught us heaps. Grabbed some pics on the way. Highly recommended.",
          "This zoo was amazing. Even in the rain it didnt stop us there was so much to see and do and so much shelter from the trees. Lovely family day out. Was amazing to see 2 pandas. Have been to heaps of zoos and only now hVe finally seen a panda. Was amazing.",
          "A fun day with quality grounds and lots of things to do for adults and kids alike. The zoo Keeper experience is a great experience and i highly recommend it.",
          "OMG - school holidays and they offer a great value program for primary aged students. My 10 year old twins loved it. Visited the zoo while I had a parents day out!!! WIN - WIN Drop off is 9am with pick up at 4pm. This was the best - thank you.",
          "We loved the experience of the well cared animals, with some great habitats for the animals. We won't forget to mention the famous Panda's we had a few photo moments.",
          "This zoo is in the most stunning setting. It is sat in the beautiful Adelaide Parklands only a short walk from the CBD. It is one of, if not the oldest zoos in Australia and the mature grounds are quite simply stunning. Even if you weren't interested in the amazing wildlife",
          "A great zoo located next to the botanical gardens, very spacious and clean. A really good variety of animals pandas and the hippos are a highlights. Some enclosures are a little dated however all the animals look very well cared for. Lots of shows available to see as well",
          "Our second visit to the zoo and it proved just as good as the first. Long lines for food was the only letdown. The lines to get in were huge, but once inside you didn't feel like there was thousands if people Lovely gardens with a really fantastic array of animals... pandas were",
          "Great zoo, heaps to see, interactive and lots of animal shows. Seeing the panda's was a highlight. It was one of the quietest zoo's which i enjoyed, not sure whether the time of year or hot weather impacted this. We enjoyed lunch at Wisteria Cafe within the zoo, nice food.",
          "Everyone involved with the panda experience was fantastic. Seeing behind the scenes, feeding Wang Wang and seeing them both up close was surreal. Worth every cent.",
          "Seeing the zoo from the eyes of my granddaughter was excellent. The excitement of the General birds flying around the zoo to pandas eating bamboo. We had a great day out and the staff were helpful and friendly.",
          "Struggled to find car parking within the area to begin with. Very much like other zoo's. A lot of empty habitats and sleeping animals (to be expected on a warm day). Over all we did enjoy our visit. Great to see water bubblers around for free access to water.",
          "The zoo is well set out, great eating place, not that expensive, animals were out and about you could see them, even though it was a Hot day, got to see the Pandas,the only animal they don\u2019t have is elephants, Good walking paths ,We had Great day..",
          "I would absolutely recommend this incredible experience. There were four of us and we all loved it. The 15 minute meerkat encounter was very well organised and surpassed my expectations. The meerkats were adorable and jumped from lap to lap to eat the fruit on our aprons ( which",
          "I was impressed by the layout, with something to see at every step of the way! Whiled away HOURS without even realising it, this zoo kept us entertained the whole day!",
          "Our bad experience at the zoo began when purchasing tickets. My husband presented his ID Card in order to obtain a senior entrance ticket. We were told, that only Australian senior cards get a discount. That wasn\u2019t a good start. Although the zoo is set in beautiful gardens, it",
          "First time I have visited and I was very impressed. I have become skeptical over time about animals in zoos. It was a lovely set up, i was lucky to go on a quiet day just before Christmas and really got to enjoy watching the animals more than I get to when I visit a zoo",
          "We're from Melbourne, so the benchmark for zoos is pretty high. This little zoo in Adelaide is in a gorgeous location. It's not overly big, but certainly packs a punch as far as quality and quantity goes. We arrived just before 11, so headed straight around to the panda",
          "The zoo is very easy to walk around! All exhibits are very well presented. Love watching the monkeys run overhead.",
          "Excellent cosy family friendly zoo. We got to see the pandas Wang Wang and FuNi - who are just the cutest little bears as well as the beautiful red pandas. There is a beautiful Giraffe there too and a cute pen of Wallabies and Kangaroos - as well as some beautiful birds and cute",
          "We visited the zoo on our road trip to Adelaide. We are a family of two adults and two teens. My eldest could not wait to see the pandas, this is the main reason we went. It was an ok zoo, compared to others we have been too in NSW, QLD and ACT, it was quite average. It is",
          "Lots of different animals from native Australian to African. Petting zoo with goats, deers and quokkas. Aviaries where you can go in to the birds. A small building on the history of the zoo. Reptile house, nocturnal animal house (which was excellent, never seen a bat that close",
          "My visit to Adelaide zoo broke my heart, every enclosure was extremely back dated, therefore every animal suffered. Majority of animals traced back and forth clearly experiencing zoocosis. I would expect a zoo with such bad morals and practices in a third world country not",
          "We visited the zoo on a fairly hot day in Adelaide. Despite the heat, many animals were active and visible. We very much enjoyed our visit. One of the most interesting things was watching the lions and tigers be fed. the keeper accessed the lioness' enclosure not five feet",
          "It was a real privilege to be on this tour with Rob as our guide. There were only the two of us and one other person so we were very fortunate to have such an intimate tour. We started with a brief introduction to the zoo then moved on to the Bamboo Forest where we met the",
          "this tour was great. first of all seeing the red pandas get fed and talking to the keepers and then seeing the two giant pandas. This tour is limited to ten people and operates before the zoo is open to the public so you have plenty of time to just watch the pandas eating and",
          "What have we done ? This was my tragic reflection as I walked away from the beautiful Cassowary bird. I guess if you want your children to understand the full impact of global capitalism then a visit to the Zoo is a fine education.",
          "We did the panda and friends tour with Rob and even my cynical husband enjoyed it! Of course the pandas are a highlight-but Robs\u2019s knowledge and enthusiasm for all the animals was outstanding. Please come and support the zoo and all the important work it does.",
          "We visited on a Tuesday. The zoo was easy to access by tram and we chose to take a trip through the Botanic Garden on our way in. The zoo was not busy at all which was wonderful as we got to see everything on our wish list. The staff were all very helpful and knowledgeable, and",
          "I have 3 children and they are free to get in buy it still cost us $74 then to hire a car is $15. I would be happy to pay that but when they have taken away some animals and hardly have any keepers doing shows you don't get much for your money. The only reason I have 3 stars",
          "We visited Adelaide Zoo ( a visit from Sydney) and booked in advance to do the Meerkat experience and Lion experience ($40 each for 15 mins and includes professional photos) On the day we also booked the Penguin experience and we were the only two for each. Maggie the",
          "Very nice place to visit .....the zoo size is a good size, you can explore the whole place in two hours if you like and more if you want to see the shows. The voulnteers are so helpful and full of knowledge and you can tell that they love what they are doing. If you in Adelaide",
          "The highlight has to be the Pandas. Best seen early during opening hours and revisit to hear the gamekeeper speak of them at 11am.",
          "Love the zoo. Lots.to look at and they try to update and keep the exhibits looking new and fresh. Gift shop and food kiosk are good.",
          "This is the best zoo we have been to and we have been to alot of zoo's in our time and all around the world , you get to see alot of healthy and amazing animals and you get real close up , just an amazing day out",
          "We visited the zoo during school term so didn\u2019t have to fight any crowds which was great. Plenty of the usual animals in really great gardens with good size enclosures. Main cafe at the entrance was open (reasonably priced food for a tourist attraction) but isn\u2019t huge snd would",
          "I always enjoy coming to the Zoo plenty of animals to see. I like seeing the otters and the meerkats as they\u2019re always high energy.",
          "Lions obviously know when they are going to get fed so they are scrabbling at cage to get food and growling which was quite dramatic. Got to see two pandas which is great as few zoos have pandas these days outside China.",
          "Most fun I can remember having at a zoo...well laid out , clean and it's worth the trip simply for the pandas. We walked from Adelaide Central railway station and through the Botanical gardens which added to the enjoyment of the whole day.",
          "Very few animals actually out in the enclosures, most were kept inside their pens. Pandas behind highly reflective glass which is fine if that protects them but the glass was reflecting a TV screen behind and that was pretty much all you could see. Certainly not the best zoo I",
          "What an amazing experience. A full 8 hours experiencing many areas not normally accessed by the public, up close with so many species, a keeper as your own personal guide, lunch provided, certificate and gift at the end and most importantly hands on animal encounters. I expect",
          "Such a lovely place! Small enough to walk all around and kids don't tire. Brilliant day out for everyone.",
          "This zoo houses two pandas which make the visit worthwhile alone. Very well presented though we thought the spaces provided for the various animals was too small. It is worth a visit to see the birds of Australia.....fantastic",
          "Gteat place to take the kids ( has playground & petting area) & is laid out on flat ground. Pandas were a great attraction",
          "Set in magically planted meandering grounds with the pandas taking the headlines, the zoo is full of enchantments & surprises around every corner. Many animals like monkeys given delightfully free rein in trees & overhead wire-netting tunnel-paths. Free flight bird display over",
          "This is an interesting zoo to visit. Plenty Australia animals and others from around the world, including two giant pandas. There are plenty of places to sit in the shade and have something to eat or drink. It\u2019s very walkable from the CBD. I would definitely recommend if you are",
          "We are Life Members of the Zoo, but in retirement we find our visits are becoming less frequent. This week we parked near the Hackney Bridge and walked along the Linear Park to the Zoo. The approach to the Zoo has been very nicely landscaped, and it was good to go inside",
          "Great zoo. All flat walking. The Pandas are so cute and amazing. Wheelie walker and wheelchair friendly.",
          "Went to the zoo, mainly to see Pandas and Quokka. It is not very far from CBD, next to Botanical Garden. When we got there, both pandas were awake and eating . And Panda info session was really good and informative. Then saw the little Quokka with the zookeeper in one of the",
          "Only Zoo in Australia to have Pandas and you won\u2019t be disappointed. The male is a real character and he was quite active when we were there. Current feeding time for them in the morning is 11am, I think there may be another one as they can eat a lot more Bamboo in 1 day than I",
          "The place is in the city center .Many osoum animals well taking care . feeding and exhibitions over the day and very close to amazing butanical garden . Great day to start with the zoo than walk back to the City center trough the garden . An amazing fun day .",
          "Clean, interesting and well worth a visit. Most animals are well presented and the facilities adequate.",
          "It was a fabulous experience holding & feeding a koala. The zoo was beautiful with lovely flowers & trees",
          "loved the adelaide zoo and all the animals and loved coming to see the pandas as the were a highlight",
          "I gave to say that this is greenest zoo I have ever been to. Trees everywhere and everything was immaculate. Great day out.",
          "It was great to be able to walk from my hotel to visit the Adelaide Zoo. It's not the biggest zoo I've ever been to but I actually enjoyed that because it meant that I could visit every part of it. I absolutely loved seeing the pandas and there is an amazing collection of birds",
          "Lots for everyone. Visit the Pandas and the Meerkats and the petting zoo (watch out for the goat) great exhibits and plenty to see and do. The volunteers and the zoo keeping staff are helpful and friendly",
          "It's so good we became members on our first visit. Just over $100 each so you only need to visit a few times to make it worth it. Not too big so it won't take you all day but plenty to see as well - we were lucky enough to catch a panda up a tree and it was adorable climbing",
          "Adelaide Zoo is well laid out and features a variety of different zones and animals. The enclosures are beautiful and thoughtfully designed to reflect the natural habitat of each animal. Standouts for us include all the walkthrough aviaries.",
          "We visited the zoo in October. It is quite small less than 8 hectares. It is well set out and the new children\u2019s section looks great. The pandas were wonderful to see. Unfortunately many enclosures were empty. Some of the enclosures looked too small for the animals housed there",
          "Went for a visit to Adelaide Zoo on a Saturday afternoon and found it pleasant. Number of animals has diminished since Monarto has opened - shows how long since we have visited ! Nice landscaping and greenery but expensive entry cost and F & B. Seemed a number of enclosures were",
          "Being from Sydney, it\u2019s hard to rival Taronga zoo, typically making our visits to zoos underwhelming. That wasn\u2019t the case with Adelaide Zoo. A fantastic array of animals, in enclosures that engage the visitor and make the animals feel incredibly close. An easy stroll and",
          "Welcome by the friendly staff at the entrance. The kids likes the coloring booklet. There was plenty of animals and zoo keeper talks. The pandas are so cute!",
          "Adelaide Zoo is a must do when in Adelaide or even if you live in Adelaide and have a few spare hours to spend a relaxing wander on a morning or afternoon. When was the last time you went to the Zoo? Oh &don\u2019t forget Monarto Safari Park which is less than 1 hour up the freeway",
          "We tagged this on to the end of a day exploring the city, and we were not disappointed. The zoo is easily walkable and the exhibits are very engaging. Even with the construction, there was plenty to see and do. I\u2019d definitely recommend visiting.",
          "Went with my 7yo daughter. We both loved it. The pandas were a huge hit! Loved that it wasn't too big that you don't get to see everything in one visit. Lunch at the cafe was very nice as well. Beautiful paths and gardens to look and walk along as well.",
          "We went to both zoo\u2019s, the Monarto open range zoo was fabulous! Well set out with lots of stations with toilets and amenities and a free bus service with commontary which was very enjoyable Interesting animals which are well cared for Adelaide zoo was fabulous as well.",
          "Loved the zoo, most of the animals were out and loving the attention of the people. Great variety of animals and a great day out for all the family.",
          "It's been a while since we've been to the Adelaide Zoo and geez it's looking awesome. A lot of changes for the better, awesome gardens, lots of open plan animal enclosures and some exciting things happening. Keep up the good work.....",
          "I managed to book into several animal experiences/encounters including the lions and I had an awesome experience at the zoo. It is a small zoo and the staff are fantastic. It does look a bit old but I can recommend visiting the Adelaide Zoo especially for people that do not like",
          "did not think this was a good zoo animals were not easy to see and some runs were wanting, but we did get agood sandwich and coffee there",
          "Not to badly priced for entry. Lots to see . Disappointed I didn\u2019t get to see giraffe and most of the animals were asleep. Loved interacting with animals that you could. Within walking distance from city.",
          "Thought we'd give the Adelaide Zoo another visit to see if anything had improved. Sadly it appeared to be even worse than our last visit. There are now even less animals to see and a lot of empty enclosures. The childrens zoo was the biggest joke, we entered the area only to",
          "We had a glorious sunny day to see the zoo but found it left us wanting. The exhibits by and large are old and tired and in many cases in very poor condition. The range of animals on display was very limited and the information provided was minimal. I felt particularly sad for",
          "Having been to many zoos around the world we would have to rate Adelaide Zoo one of the best. The animals didn't appear stressed with their tidy, clean surroundings. Friendly staff and volunteers. Visit the Pandas about 9.45am and you will see them having breakfast. After that",
          "very nice day out. great seeing the pandas. just a shame that on a sunday the cafe near the rotunda was closed. would have been really nice to have been able to get some hot food or a hot drink while the rain storm passed over.",
          "We are season members and have been for the last 4 years - with small kids it is a real nice treat to be able to go even for just an hour or two. The children\u2019s play area is excellent . The only complaint i have is that for a kids venue, i believe there should be better",
          "The staff and many volunteers added to the visit. It was a cold morning the day we were there but stayed about 4 hours and as the sun warmed everyone up they became more active and entertaining. Animals looked healthy. Many school children were visiting and it was encouraging to",
          "The zoo was so beautiful, I love everything , but holding the koala bear in my arms was the best experience \ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98\ud83e\udd98",
          "We had a fantastic tour named Panda and friends. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and showed us so much and explained behind the scenes stories of the animals and the zoo. The tour is not cheap but well worth it! Be aware that the Adelaide Zoo has no government funding so",
          "Never thought I would visit the zoo once my children grew up. But of course there are grandkids. What a great zoo, the animals all had great space and the pandas, so happy that the kids got to see them. We will be back for another visit for sure. When the next grandkids come to",
          "My wife wanted to see the Pandas, so we were always going to come to Adelaide and visit the zoo. Then we found on their website that they offer the opportunity to go behind the scenes and be a keeper for a day. That was something too good to refuse. What this turned into was",
          "Recently visited with my husband! We had such a beautiful day! Although it was cold and raining so bring a jacket and umbrella as there's not many places to hide unless you bunk in with the snakes or under the rotunda. Other than that we got to play for ages with the Quokkas.",
          "We'd been wanting to go here every time in Adelaide but never had the time.This time we did & it is fabulous.It's a must for all members of a family to go to or a couple like us.It's an easy walk around the beautiful grounds & the staff are very friendly & helpful.Seeing the",
          "I don't love zoos..they make me sad... this zoo certainly tries in a number of good ways..there are many local animals.. and they have tried to create more animal friendly spaces for the animals. But, it felt 'tired'.. and a zoo...",
          "Brilliant range of animals to view, all of which had ample space and suitable enrichment items and activities available to them. Staff were very lovely from entry, to retail, through to the zookeepers. I must say the staff at the pandas were extremely helpful and it was",
          "The pandas were the highlight of the zoo. As I went in on a weekday where bad weather was forecast, the zoo was very quiet and I was able to have some good chats with the staff at some of the enclosures regarding the animals. I spent a good hour with the giant pandas and red",
          "Loved the pandas \u2764\ufe0f Nice zoo, not very Big, but Nice place to spend a couple of hours - it was Nice and clean, and the animals looked healty",
          "Did the Lemur feeding experience at Adelaide Zoo. Awesome experience. Highly recommend this to visitors. Only 3 people at a time do the feeding and there is a photographer on hand. The staff are great and very informative. Loved the pics and had a great up close experience.",
          "Hadn\u2019t been to the zoo in a few years. Very impressed with the renovations and additional family friendly spaces such as the playground. Would like to see some more large enclosures for the animals to have room to move.",
          "Another lovely day having a visit to the zoo. Love to see our favourite Brutus the Hippo and this time the birds were particularly interesting. Fair bit of structural work underway which should see some improvements. Sadly a few animals have died lately and it will be",
          "On the weekend my family visited the Adelaide zoo for a 1st birthday celebration. Although we had a lovely day out, the highlight was to be seeing animals at the zoo, however, we were rather blown away at the fact that there is barely any animals left in our zoo. Could not",
          "bring a packed lunch, plenty of places to sit and eat i think its a little run down make sure you check out the monkeys at feeding time they put on a good show",
          "Adelaide Zoo is a good way to see Australian wildlife and other animals, although animal sanctuaries are better but quite a drive from the cities. It is a relatively an old zoo, enclosures could be bigger, but I believe that improvements are being planned. Most of the animals",
          "What a wonderful experience to visit a zoo essentially in the beautiful Adelaide city area. The place is so clean and well maintained, a credit to the team. If you love birds, this place is for you. They have an amazing collection and we were thrilled to see so many living",
          "This is a great zoo with passionate keepers. Not as big as zoos like Taronga but is definitely worth visiting. It is the only zoo with Giant Pandas. We visited first thing and the crowds were not that big and the pandas were very active. In the later morning they can often be",
          "The zoo is not as good as it used to be. There was no sign of the tigers (not sure if there are still meant to be tigers?, the baboons were off limits for some reason, the orangutans were allowed to stay inside due to the weather, and the pandas looked asleep/dead without any",
          "Whenever we visit a major City we try to include a visit to a City's Zoo on our itinerary. Small, even by Australian standards, our visit to Adelaide Zoo was truly delightful. The Zoo's layout made it easy to navigate and the placement of undercover viewing platforms helped us",
          "We have been in country for more than a week and we needed to see kangaroos - we were not disappointed - we found them in the first 20 minutes - what a pleasure. Early in afternoon and they were very sleepy - darn - but we saw them. The rest of the zoo was great and laid out",
          "Wonderful ! Bamboo forest visit: it worths ! We could see the two pandas and other animals before zoo was open to the general public",
          "Mum and adult daughter from Melbourne. We did the panda and friends tour and enjoyed it very much. Our guide Rob was friendly and informative. He had interesting facts about the animals and stories about animal adventures and misadventures over the years. Although the zoo is",
          "An early wakeup was so worth it to see the pandas in action searching for their breakfast and seeing them up close eating their bamboo! We were lucky enough to see both Wang Wang and Fu Ni climb trees, Fu Ni even went all the way up and sat there, I've attached a pic to show!",
          "Aust. 2nd oldest zoo. & operated on a non-profit basis. Open 9.30-5pm every day. It is home to white cheeked gibbons & notable Pandas Funi & Wang Wang. 8 hectares & 2,500 animals & native mammals, birds, reptiles & fish. There's 2 cafes & magnificent landscaping, plus a natures",
          "We came here after googling that it was run by a conservation organisation which lead me to assume it would be more open range for the animals rather than tiny cages designed purely for gawking. I know it was naive as all it would have taken was another quick Google search to",
          "The Adelaide Zoo has always been a fun trip out, I took my partner there for a day and he really enjoyed it. Well set out and lots of animals, a nice little zoo in the heart of the CBD",
          "The information provided was very good and Wang Wang did all the right things for a photo opportunity.",
          "Adelaide zoo is not huge, but for their size they have a lot of the animals you probably want to see. They are the only place in Australia (perhaps the southern hemisphere?) where you can see giant pandas. We found the signposts were not always clear, but the zoo is small enough",
          "Visited the zoo last Friday with our little one. Parked on War Memorial Drive, which is only a short walk to the zoo entrance. Spent a couple hours looking at the animals and birds. Easy access around the zoo with a pram. Baby change rooms available. The grounds, animal and bird",
          "Great to see the Pandas and all of the other smaller animals. A little disappointing that larger animals are no longer at the Zoo.",
          "Toddler's first visit to a zoo was exciting. Children's area was a thrill. Seeing the live animals that \"go\" with the sounds and picture books was an experience. Timing was a little loose with actual event schedules. Missed one event due to being delayed for maintenance, with",
          "We went on a weekday, despite the rain we really enjoyed it. Lots of schools on excursions and a few of the cafe's/kiosks were not open, I suspect because it was the middle of the week and not very busy. We went primarily to see the Pandas which did not disappoint, there are a",
          "We have been to a lot of zoos and this one was pretty good. Loved the panda bears, the hippo and the lions. The place is kept very clean and tidy. The staff were very helpful. It is an easy walk around, so perfect for all the family.",
          "While we did not take part in any of the activities. My Granddaughter and I had a great day out. She is especially interested in Birds and loved the Hyacinth Macaw. We enjoyed viewing the Rhinoceros the Monkeys running around in the overhead cage and she enjoyed seeing the",
          "We visited to see the Pandas and were very impressed with the enclosure. They were wonderful to see and we returned to their enclosure 3 times until we got to see them very active and moving around. Gorgeous. Apart from a few other enclosures and public areas the zoo looks very",
          "Ok. So Adelaide Zoo is not the largest like Sydney and Melbourne but it makes a great day out for the family or just a single person who wants to take up close pics of the majority of animals and birds...and yes koalas and roos are also very close,so even the little ones get a",
          "I went to see the pandas. Arrived early and they were eating. Best time to see them. Then wandered around the rest of the Zoo. Small but well set out. I walked there along the river. Cost $37 to get in.",
          "If it wasn\u2019t for the pandas I think I would go to Monarto zoo instead. It was expensive to enter....",
          "My main purpose was to see the pandas, great exhibit, informative volunteers & lots of space for everyone. The rest of the zoo\u2019s exhibits suffer because it would appear a lot of the budget goes to the big drawcard, the pandas. I felt the other animals don\u2019t have large enough",
          "Even though the Adelaide zoo is quite small compare to other zoos around the world it has been modernised and updated with style . We had a lovely day out looking at the animals and spending time with our teenager . A peaceful environment clean and modern.",
          "The zoo is a great place to visit as usual. Mixed feelings with lions paving the same route over and over and I think they need to spend more on the reptile area. At $37 per adult it can get pricy quickly and oh the weather is not great and there are no animals out, it does seem",
          "Not really just for the Meerkats... the Pandas are incredible as well as all the animals. We had a close encounter with a lyre bird too which was my highlight! Be careful of the goat in the petting enclosure. It eats everything! The giraffes were also great.",
          "This zoo was great. We saw - up close, koalas, kangaroos, Pandas, a tiger, hippo and beautiful birds and monkeys. The gibbons were extremely loud but not nearly as loud as the hundreds on primary and high school kids there on school trips.",
          "I am a Zoo Member so can visit the Zoo and Monarto as many tmes as I like in the year. I can stay 1/2 hr or all day. I love it. It is very green and I think our Animals all have amazing sites.",
          "We went to see the Panda's and were not disappointed at all. Spent about an hour just watching them.",
          "We caught the free connector bus from Adelaide city to a stop right outside the Zoo. The zoo itself was like a little oasis in the city with lots of trees, greenery and shade. The enclosures are small but that gives you an excellent view of the animals who all seem to be",
          "This zoo is a pleasure to wander through. With the 2 Panda's being the highlight , however there are plenty of other beautiful animals. Plan to spend half a day to really enjoy all it has to offer.",
          "Even though it was a cool and showery day, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves wandering around observing the animals at play. Enjoyed a coffee and a bite to eat before wandering around. Unfortunately we missed the various animal feeding times as did not get there until 11.30am.",
          "I recently visited Adelaide zoo and absolutely loved it. I was staying in the city and the zoo is a nice easy walk. I stumbled across a zoo tour which happened to be departing at that exact moment. I ended up doing all six parts of the tour which was extremely interesting and",
          "My 10 year old grandson loved it it was a great way to let him learn about working with animals he loved learning about the animals had all his questions answered and they gave him useful information on how to get started in a career of working with animals all the staff were",
          "The Panda and Friends tour was amazing and worth every cent. We were very lucky to be the only 2 on the tour, having the advantage to see the animals every in the morning and before any other visitors was great. The giant Pandas were beautiful and fantastic as were a number of",
          "The animals were all really tired after the heatwave. There isn't many food options inside so be sure to take a picnic and make a day of it!",
          "This Zoo is smaller compared to Monato, South Australia\u2019s most biggest zoo. It contains general species of animal \ud83e\udd92 from alligators \ud83d\udc0a to Sweet Chinese Pandas \ud83d\udc3c your sure to have a blast there. With Guided Tours Every One Hour they are packed with an awesome crew ready to help",
          "I spent the whole day wondering in the park, there is so much to see !! Pandas are definitely the stars but do not neglect the rest. The kid zoo with goats and chickens was entertaining as well. All the team members that we met where friendly and helpful. Do not forget the",
          "We spent Friday morning at the zoo and it was so worth seeing the pandas!! Get there early so you don\u2019t line up to see the animals especially the pandas!!",
          "The visit was during the school holidays and many young children were enjoying the animals they could see. Definitely a very good activity for parents who want to give their children an enjoyable learning experience.",
          "Spent a lovely Sunday here, The zoo is a bit tired, but is still a pleasant way to spend the day. Lots of animals to see. The Pandas are especially good to see, if at 1st your viewing isn't all that good, come back again and they should be active.",
          "This was an excellent outing. The parking was easy to find and the sun was shining but it was not too hot to walk around. The Zoo itself is very well set out and it was easy to walk around to view all the exhibits. The 'occupants' of the Zoo were well looked after and",
          "This was an amazing experience and a privilege to be so close and able to feed them. The Keepers have the best job in the world and were wonderful. We are so lucky to have these beautiful Panda's in Australia. We stayed at the Meriton on Frome which is 15 mins down hill to the",
          "The grounds are amazing but I thought the enclosures look tired and in need of an update. It is quite expensive but understand the need for costing is due to the need for money to help keep the Zoo running.",
          "Our planned whirlwind trip to the Zoo (to give ourselves time to view Adelaide\u2019s other attractions) turned into a whole day wandering between the various animals. You could sit and watch the Panda\u2019s for 2-3 hours alone!!! Then you have the Quokka\u2019s, Orangutan, bird show, Lion &",

          "Privileged to see Australia's only pandas and oldest hippopotamus! The keepers talks well worth it. Stunning grounds and hopefully the master plan includes ground expansion for the various cats who tend to pace. The Storm Boy pelican was also being very mischievous and well",

          "A pretty good zoo with a good range of animals,well set out with good walking paths between animals. The apes and monkeys are worth a visit. Best animals to see are the Pandas, if they are sleeping or just relaxing come back later and they could be active and playful as this is",
          "Adelaide Zoo is a great, if a small zoo located in the botanic gardens. Lots of volunteers to explain about the animals, flat walking paths and cages that allow you to get close enough to see the animals! Great for Families",

          "A memorable day out! Loved all the exhibits - especially the hippo! All animals looked happy and joyful, except the lions. The poor lions are way overdue for a new enclosure! They looked sad and bored.However, all in all, another great day at Adelaide Zoo!",
          "The pandas were a highlight. A great adventure park for the kids to play in. Friendly and informative staff. The only downside was that some enclosures had had their animals removed but overall we had a ball",
          "We had a wonderful day at Adelaide zoo. The staff were all friendly and informative. We met a volunteer keeper called Brian who chatted with us and was helpful and gave us lots of information about their cute panda bears. This is a lovely place to visit if you have young",
          "As were in Adelaide as part of our overseas trip we thought we would take a look at the zoo. Well at nearly $80 to get in I was expecting a lot better. Didn\u2019t see any tigers, orangutans or giraffes not sure why plenty of small animals to children interested I suppose. We left",
          "Without them, the experience wouldn\u2019t have been as pleasant. Thanks to Jill, Robyn & Shaun for bringing us around the zoo and sharing interesting facts about them. The blind echidna was particularly adorable.",

          "We went on a Sunday. The women\u2019s AFL final was on. Finally got a park. A really good zoo. Well done. thank you.",
          "Very well kept zoo. Can see most of the animals up close. Especially enjoyed seeing the crocs and panda. Worth a days visit.",
          "On a recent visit to town my daughter and I visited on an overcast Sunday. A small in area zoo very close to central Adelaide. A lot of very interesting animals and displays. Well worth the money and we did enjoy the zoo overall and particularly the primates. I did feel a little",
          "The Adelaide Zoo is a great way to spend half a day, or even a whole day with children. There is a large playground near the kiosk which has a good menu. Good spot to go after looking at the animals, to tire the little ones out for the trip home.",
          "What a horrible place for a zoo the pathways were shocking with tree stumps everywhere. The most animals we saw were birds and plenty of them. Just a sad place to call a zoo",
          "The zoo has lots of exhibits for its size. You can easily walk around most of the zoo in two hours or less. The facility is very clean and easy to navigate. We were there in a weekday and it was very quiet which made for easy viewing at every exhibit. The zoo is an easy walk",
          "You can spend hours here, lots of animals and a nice zoo. Make sure you check out the panadas. Also watch out for anything that is on the day you visit.",
          "I went to the zoo purely to see the Giant Pandas. They did not disapoint, they were awesome. There were many other great aniamls to see as well. Time slipped away from us so we did miss out on some animals, but it was a lovely day out.",
          "Adelaide Zoo isn\u2019t big. It\u2019s quite easy to see everything. The pandas were doing their favourite thing, sleeping! The monkeys were great fun to watch. The zoo certainly reinforces our responsibility to look after our environment. Good day out, especially with kids.",
          "Hadnt been to the zoo for years! Was surprised how good it was. Several upgrades happening so was a couple of detours. But overall good. Food was nice and not badly priced. Shop was cute. Nice staff. Bats in the gardens outside was a bonus!",
          "Had a family day outing and was very disappointed with most exhibits and small selection of animals on display.As for the pandas.. well , better hope they are awake and moving otherwise they are a complete waste of time.Better to leave them in their natural habitat.After our",
          "We were in Adelaide for WOMAD and spent the afternoon before at the zoo. The Pandas were stunning and their enclosure spacious. Wherever we wandered the staff and volunteers were extraordinarily nice and helpful and very informatative. They were all exceptional. Some of the",
          "Very spacious zoo with knowledgable and friendly staff. I partook in the koala encounter and it was life changing to say the least. It\u2019s very clean and spacious.",
          "This was definitely the highlight of my trip to Adelaide. The zoo is very well maintained and staffed compared to others in major cities within Australia (without naming). The animals were quite sleepy as the day was extremely hot however the enclosures allowed enough sight to",
          "Always a good way to help overcome jet lag , keeps you interested and moving , a good collection of world animals and indigenous animals. the aviary and pandas are the stand out visits for me.",
          "The last zoo Id been to was pretty boring (and expensive!) so I found Adelaide zoo fascinating! I mean they got hippos, pandas, sea lions, lions, orangutans, gigantic pelicans and monkeys! And bones of deceased giraffe and elephant was quite interesting to look at. I had a",
          "Very clean and well presented place. Close interaction with the animals. It's amazing to have the opportunity to see the Pandas in person. There are meerkats in several places, they are definitely eye catching, funny, and sociable. Lovely place.",
          "Well plotted and planned zoo with animals, birds, reptiles placed in natural, tho small, habitats. Visit first thing in the morning or late afternoon as most of the critters are inactive in the heat of the day. The zoo keepers and volunteer guides are knowledgeable and eager to",
          "The Adelaide Zoo is great for very young children as it is small and has enough to keep them interested for about an hour. The playground is also lots of fun. However, without young kids, I would give it a miss. Yes there are the new giant pandas, giraffes and look but otherwise",
          "We went to the Zoo on Australia Day. It was really hard to find animals out and about. After our visit we got given some pointers from friends - go early in the morning - research feeding times - avoid Hot days This will help you paying alot of money to see empty cages. **",
          "What a fantastic zoo. Beautiful manicured, lush & inviting to all animals. Even the Hippo\u2019s looked contented. The Panda experience was very special, and very informative by the volunteers.",
          "Visited the zoo for the first time in years especially looking forward to seeing pandas. Was struck my the fact that the Adelaide zoo is now for small animals with all the large animals at Monato. Had a great day but more for children than adults. Pandas were sleeping so didn\u2019t",
          "I took my Grandson for a quick visit to the zoo which he enjoyed. I was saddened that some of the animals of my childhood visits to this zoo no longer exist however there are new additions like the pandas and they\u2019re adorable. I think the zoo is a must-do experience for all",
          "I have visited Adelaide Zoo on numerous occasions. Each time I visit there are more empty enclosures. So many animals have either died and not replaced or moved on to Monarto. The price is exorbitant for what you get. If it was a little cheaper more families would visit and",
          "Went here when Schools had all gone back, so it was really quiet. We were greeted by friendly staff and we were impressed by the clean environment. The range of animals is great and we were amazed to see a Hippo near the entrance. My one year old son loved the Pandas.",
          "An absolutely beautiful zoo, with th a wonderful variety of animals to see in nice enclosures. The panda bears are as mesmerising as I hoped they would be and the meerkats truly captivating. Well laid out, easy walking paths and a good choice of places to eat, all reasonably",
          "I remember how the zoo was back in the 70s and 80s.....not fancy but had plenty of exotic and big animals. Now, a lot of the enclosures are sitting empty or have been replaced by cafes and playgrounds. Pandas were great, so too the bird show on the grass. The whole place looks",
          "The staff were helpful and cheerful panda was extremely friendly to watch feeding around the enclosure.",
          "Second visit for us as a family. Looking a little secondhand and could do with a freshen up. Many of the enclosures where empty and interactive displays not operational. The App is basically of little value, don\u2019t waste your time. However pleasantly surprised by the quality and",
          "We went to the Zoo with my husbands work a special night time opening. It was great fun. It's a beautiful zoo, easy to get around. Staff were great. Awesome for little kids. Lots there to look at. Most of the animals were around. Even heard the lyrebird do its thing!!",
          "zoo is pleasant enough but the major attraction, being the pandas was disappointing.the zoo seems to lack funding, pathways are worn and instead od say timber, sheets of plywood and tacked on almost as an afterthought.",
          "I have been to the zoo a number of times but this was the first 'experience' I had done. Whilst the guide was very knowledgeable and there were no other visitors in the zoo except for those of us on this experience it all felt a bit lame. The giant pandas sat eating their",
          "Cute animals and lots to see. Friendly employees and love the layout of the zoo. Separate place for the kids to play and cafes to eat in or on a bench watching the residents enjoy their day. I visit yearly and maybe more, fun experience each time- never bored.",
          "This zoo is nice and well set out although some of the animal enclosures seemed worryingly small. The Pandas were the highlight without a doubt and they didn't disappoint. The monkeys have a trick that you need to be wary of - there is an elevated walkway by the enclosure and at",
          "Spent a good few hours wandering around Adelaide Zoo on Monday 11th February. Was lucky enough to see Wang Wang wandering about his enclosure and listen to the Panda talk by the young lady zoo keeper, she was very passionate about the topic and happily stayed behind afterwards",
          "Had a brilliant day out at the Zoo. Make sure you get a map in order to see everything as the park does cover a large area and you won\u2019t want to miss anything. My favourite was the area where you can go and see baby kangaroos and goats. You can get up close and personal. We",
          "Lovely gardens and great enclosures a really easy zoo to walk around and a nice day out Be nice to see some empty enclosures have animals in them",
          "Love seeing the beautiful animals, easy to get around, friendly staff, lovely for children. Nice spots to have a little picnic.",
          "Got to see lots of animals! The panda bear was awesome to see...they think/hope the female may be pregnant. The tiger and lions were active. Saw a lyrebird that was not happy with people in its space...so amazing to see and hear it. Layout of zoo was great and done very",
          "Just spent a number of hours at Adelaide Zoo. Really nice, compact and flat location with easy access for prams etc. Staff were very informative and exhibits all looked to be well cared for. The Zoo is very conveniently located to the CBD and represents a very pleasant day out",
          "We went on a 6 Day cruise to Adelaide, and I was quite impressed by such friendly people lovely clean town , took a taxi from the train Station to the Zoo what a fantastic zoo saw one of the panda\u2019s and they had life size robotic dinosaurs etc, such a lovely relaxing zoo not too",
          "We had a lovely day at the Adelaide zoo. Very pram friendly too. Easy to get around. The cafe was good, with lots of kids options. Great day out.",
          "This is a well kept and pretty zoo to wander around. It is very central and easy to get to right next door to The Botanical Gardens and Botanic Park. If you live in Adelaide and intend to visit the zoo frequently, as I do, (I go often with my grandsons), then it is definitely",
          "I love going to this zoo I'm a member and attend many times through the year. It maybe smaller than some but I enjoy the grounds and many animals. My favourite are the meerkats can sit for hours watching them. I now use a mobility scooter which is accessible to most areas. If",
          "Really nice fairly simple zoo. Well presented and staff friendly. Very much enjoyed 1/2 day here before jumping on a cruise in the late afternoon.",
          "Decided to go to the Adelaide Zoo after not going since a young kid. Was a fun day. $36 entry for an adult isn't exactly on the cheap side these days. Concession is a bit cheaper. Food also on the expensive side but that's normal it seems for these types of attractions. Didn't",
          "Easy walk from centre of Adelaide. Good range of animals, but we were mainly interested in indigenous Australian mammals and of course the Pandas. Both were lying down, but we could get an idea of their size. Koalas were of course asleep in the trees.",
          "We went at opening and straight to the pandas. One was out and was playing. It was great to see Wang Wang (?) playing and running around. The volunteer lady at the enclosure was amazing with a wealth of panda information, and she clearly had a passion for the zoo. We learnt so",
          "This behind the scenes tour is one of the best tours of this kind that we have ever done. Our guide Rob was brilliant and the ability to be able to walk around the zoo before it opened to the public and more importantly see the pandas (and their friends) while they are being fed",
          "its very outdated kids should be free when adult pays gift shop is overpriced with stuff from china, food expensive best to pack a lunch and drink",
          "Really hot day, so a lot of animals hiding, seems great setup, but confusing direction walking around, tried app, easier to ask staff where I was, great older lady , chatted about animals, think volunteers, great idea. Cafe nice food and friendly every where with staff at the",
          "Had a great day with the 2 little boys at the zoo. So much to do and with the dinosaurs there as well, they had a blast. Got the kids lunch boxes which were really good value",
          "Plenty of shade and not too big so comfortable and easy to make way around with young ones. Pandas are fascinating to learn about and the interesting animals and sections made for a great day. Only one cafe accessible on a reasonably busy day - would be good to have access at",
          "A lovely walk from the City Centre. Small enough that you can see everything easily in a day with young kids. We used passes we\u2019d bought at Melbourne Zoo so great value too. The day we visited was v busy as school hols but they\u2019d upped catering to accommodate.",
          "Spent the day wandering around. Was clean, well maintained. Not too many big animals left. Dinosaur experience was on at the time we were there which was well done and wonderful for the kids. We were there for feeding times of the lions and tigers Staff were helpful and friendly",
          "I was really impressed with the Adelaide Zoo. The grounds and enclosures are all beautifully thought through. Good food offering at the entrance and a great selection of animals to see. But perhaps the best thing was the attitude of the volunteers. They just seems o appear",
          "Adelaide Zoo is walking distance from the city and is adjacent to the botanical gardens. Melbourne Zoo members get free entry. This zoo has a good range of animals and the walking paths are well laid out. Most animals can be seen from various vantage points. I really enjoyed",
          "A great way to spend a few hours although can be somewhat expensive. Definitely worth it to see some fantastic animals and make sure to get a Golden North ice cream to eat while you're there!",
          "I love the zoo - I'm a bit biased having been a life member for the last 15 years, but it's really worth a visit with the family. There are some lovely experiences like the Macaws flying across the lawn at lunchtime and the feeding times for the animals. The pandas are good too",
          "Good day out don\u2019t need all day to look around fairly easy to get around very close to city walked from our hotel and walked to Dundalk mall afterwards possibly not the most organised layout but still enjoyed the visit and would recommend to anyone with spare time looking for",
          "We went early to secure a close parking spot and before the heat kicked in Plenty of variety to see and volunteer guides when we were unsure where to go next The highlight was the south East Asian walk thru aviary The food at the cafe catered for our special needs We said",
          "We visited the zoo on a Saturday and were a little concerned when we arrived to find a long line but thankfully it moved quickly and the zoo did not feel crowded when you walked around. The zoo is not large but we spent most of the day there. The pandas were the big hit for our",
          "My Japanese friend was impressed by the spacious Panda\u2019s enclosure. She and her grandson enjoyed watching them, as there were not too many visitors on Monday morning.",
          "Small zoo in comparison to others in Australia, but enjoyable nonetheless. I was surprised at this zoo having very well maintained exhibits, such as the panda exhibit, which was large and open, including an indoor area. Speaking of such, this is the only Australian zoo housing",
          "We went there especially to see the Pandas only to be told by the volunteers that we had to be quiet and not stand to close because they\u2019re tired after mating season. Waste of time and money. Food so expensive too. Thank god they had meerkats.",
          "Block out at least half a day for this - bring a water bottle, a hat and some sunscreen, and take plenty of time at each enclosure. The absolute highlight though, is that you get to pet quokkas - the adorable, always-smiling little guys are so friendly they will run right up to",
          "It was a big day but our 3 year old had lots of fun! Some of the animal enclosures were under construction so we didn\u2019t see a few exhibits but over all it was a fun day lots of memories made! We ate at one of the cafes it was very pricey but was nice.",
          "Lovely zoo, at the moment they have colossal creatures, really big insects, kids loved the displays.Really enjoyed the bird flight. We took a picnic lunch, stayed for the whole day. Take your time to really see the different animals.",
          "I've been to Adelaide Zoo numerous times, even holding a yearly pass at one time, and it's always a place I'm happy to visit. The zoo itself is not too large so you can easily see many of the main attractions within a couple of hours. There are numerous animals from all over",
          "Visited the Zoo on New Years Day with our daughter and young children. The cost of entry is out of the reach of the average family. $72 for two adults, one 11 year old with a 25% off voucher. Our 2 yo was free. That\u2019s a lot of food you could put on the table. Seniors discount",
          "Adelaide Zoo was everything we expected. The animals were well looked after and the keepers and volunteer staff were very friendly and informative. The Meerkats were fun to watch and the petting zoo is amazing for the young and old.",
          "Firstly, I hold a membership card so I\u2019m biased about Adelaide and Monarto Zoos. The effort they go to in continuously improving the enclosures each time we go is really commendable. They are actively part of world wide conservation programs and education programs. They are a",
          "The meerkat decided to pose for photos. The giraffe we so tall. The hippo is 53 years old which is extremely old for hippos",
          "Good family day out. Easy to get to on the free Adelaide bus which drops you off right at the entrance. Nice Zoo to walk around for younger kids - mine are 9 & 11 Years old and they enjoyed it. Don\u2019t go on a hot day though as the Panda\u2019s are not out at all.",
          "With a zoo pass we can pop in any time. Was good to see the dinosaurs. I wish we could share our zoo passes though, as being from the country, we don't get to go very often.",
          "You can park in the botanic gardens but make sure to get a 10 hour spot since 4 is not enough. If it is a Sunday then it is free (but still time restrictions apply). The zoo map is a bit opaque since it doesn't name the animals but has outlines so you have to guess. Our map",
          "Visited here today and to be honest didn't expect a great deal given some of the reviews and comments I had read before visiting. I was pleasantly surprised by Adelaide Zoo. It is not the smallest or worst zoo I have been to, there are plenty of exhibits, some different animals",
          "The day we went to the zoo I was very surprised to see 2 seals in such a small pool they were both just laying on the bottom of the pool they had no fresh running water to the pool the seals just have no room to swim. The pelicans had no water in their pool sad to see then out",
          "Not crowded, easy to get from different enclosures. The day was relatively hot, so many animals were hiding. Advisable to go on a cooler day.",
          "My husband and I recently visited this zoo with two young family members. It was a brutally hot day, but the kids managed to cool off in the playground. Misting devices are thoughtfully placed in a few areas, as are water bottle refill stations which we appreciated. However",
          "Had an amazing day at the zoo! The staff always put on a good show with the animals. The huge range of animals is great",
          "Great zoo Great park and lots to see But the Pandas are the Bomb! Worth the admission just to watch them for hours Spectacular event and location so much funny stuff the animals do!",
          "We went to the zoo on a very hot day, so understandably the animals were very lethargic. Signage was very bad, and some animals indicated on the map were hard to find, or just not there.",
          "This zoo is well organized and has versatile collection of animals. They are well displayed. Perhaps the chicken net fences were too dense. Their too small \"apertures\" disturbed photographing of animals, especially photographing of birds. The banda house's windows reflected",
          "I don't like going to zoos and don't agree with animals living in captivity however my boyfriend wanted to go and I was pleasantly surprised. This was a beautifully clean zoo with many more animals than I'd expected. I had never seen giant pandas before so this was a highlight.",
          "Zoos can be a challenging concept altogether (NEVER go to the LA Zoo) - but Adelaide Zoo is one of the Good Ones. Their conservation and breeding programmes, the space they give animals and the general condition and well-being of the animals make this a pleasant place for the",
          "Arrived shortly after opening time. When straight to see the Pandas. A must see if going to the zoo. I wouldn't race about the rest. It was a hot morning, only cafe open was one at the main gate, where zoo staff were doing work near the play ground(so had to go long way around",
          "A sunny afternoon and visit to the botanical garden at which time we saw a sign to the zoo and decided to visit. We were not disappointed. Great enclosures, healthy animals, friendly, accessible, knowledgeable staff. Plenty to see. Fantastic visit rounded off with close up",
          "My 11 years old join zoo keeper for a day in Adelaide zoo. It was amazing. She got to do and see lots of things/activities that she can\u2019t usually see as a visitor. I highly recommended anyone one with children join this activity. The zoo keeper was Luke he\u2019s handsome and",
          "Throughly enjoyed our trip to the Adelaide Zoo. Very easy to get to and parking was easy to find. There were a good range of 4 to 10 hour parking spots available. Recommend visiting on the weekend as the the parking is cheaper then during the week. The Zoo is well laid out with",
          "What an amazing place, there is a lot to see & do, I spent hours just walking around & looking at all the different animals. The panda\u2019s were so amazing. A great place for the whole family\ud83d\udc4d",
          "I loved the zoo! The giant panda was out and posing and eating and it was super cute. I almost missed the native animal petting zoo at the back of the park, thank goodness I noticed it on the map and went back because a kangaroo licked my hand and it was so cute and I loved",

          "A very lovely Zoo. Not too huge but plenty of variety of exhibits, animals/birds on display. However don't expect to see some of the nocturnal animals during hot days, especially wombats. The small reptile house is well presented. New tree-top walkways through exhibits are",
          "Allow at least 3 hours to stroll around as the area to cover is much bigger than it seems and the map does not show a direct route to take to see all the animals. A couple of highlights were the giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni who put on a bit of a show. Also it was good to",
          "My friend and I visited the Zoo as she had never been before the most things that was displayed was birds and monkeys not worth the money",
          "It took us about 5hrs to see most things, but didn't do any shows and we caught the free bus service here. $36 entry fee was reasonable, though the shop didn't have much of interest for me. Signs were really informative and clear and there was plenty of places to sit and",
          "We were lucky with the weather, cloudy but pleasant. The Hippopotamus didn't want the people looking at him so he stayed under the water a bit disappointing. The Pandas, the male was very sociable and didn't move but the female wandered around and then went into her den. The",
          "We had an amazing time at the zoo, especially appreciating our Panda & friends experience! We got to enter an hour before regular opening hour and got to see some animals getting fed, the highlights of course being the two Panda sorts. We were lucky as the pandas all came quite",
          "The zoo would have to be my favourite attraction in Adelaide. Catch the free connector bus to the door. We booked the 'Panda and Friends' tour and it was amazing. We saw most of the zoo (up close) before the gates opened. The package encluded a guided tour of the zoo and",

          "Easy bus ride on the free bus to Adelaide Zoo from the CBD. Entry Cost $78 for two. Everything is in easy walking distance and you don\u2019t have to exhaust yourself getting to the next display. We took the most pics on holiday in this place place. Love love love the Pandas! Only",

          "As you might have guessed from the title, I really loved this zoo. The only zoo in Australia with Giant Pandas and as soon as I got there they told me the Pandas go to sleep by mid day so if I wanted to see them active I should get there first. They also set out the zoo so the",

          "We had a easy walk around the whole zoo. The pandas were relaxing as they always are LOL. We were surprised to see an echidna in the bird aviary. The curlews fanned their wings to chase it away which was quite fascinating. We assumed they had nest nearby.",
          "Small zoo in comparison to other zoos., didn\u2019t have all animals. Well maintained. The highlight was the panda\u2019s, they were great. A really good presentation given on pandas.",

          "Great for kids and adults. Amazing selection of animals including some we\u2019ve never seen before. Large zoo so could use a whole day exploring it. Worth seeing some shows to make the most out of it and learn something. Lovely walk from Flinders Street past the river.",

          "Walked along to the zoo from the station, about 20 minutes. No queue. Our first stop and the main reason for our visit was to see the Giant Panda's. We were not disappointed, absolutely excellent views. First class. Good views of a lovely big male Lion, fabulous female Tiger",
          "Small zoo. Get there early if you want to see the animals moving around before the sleep for the rest of the day. Recommend seeing the Pandas early as they are at their most active. Also got see the Meerkats with very young babies. Great little zoo. Only downside some of the",

          "Easy to get to the Zoo when staying in Adelaide, short walk from the city. Had an great time at the Zoo, saw the lions and tigers feeding time. The animal enclosures are well-designed, so even when there is a large crowd everyone gets a chance to see the animals.",

          "I was quite shocked to learn 2 Adults and 1 child was $91.50!!! I would strongly recommend you review your pricing, given the zoo is not hands on and interactive...... We were not told about the Adelaide zoo iphone app ....found this out when we were leaving :(. Would have been",
          "My main reason to visit Adelaide was to see the giant pandas, so I decided to pay $135 for the experience of seeing them before the zoo opened and when they are more likely to be active. There were only 4 of us in the group and we spent about 30 minutes watching the pandas",
          "My sister had her wedding here. The staff were friendly, set up and packed up fast. I would have my own wedding here if I could.",

          "We don't usually go to Zoos thinking that we don't want to see animals enclosed -we would rather see them in the wild but Adelaide Zoo has changed all that .The animals and birds were so well looked after and the message of conservation so strong especially how endangered some",
          "My son and I loved the zoo. It was a great day out. Close to the city. You can catch the free bus there and back. Recommended.",
          "My main reason for travelling to the zoo was to see the pandas which I had the fun of viewing. Then there was the experience of all other aspects of the zoo. Following the schedule of timed events and feeding of animals is worthwhile.",
          "In Adelaide for the weekend, we got our walk on through the botanical gardens, and decided to try the zoo. What a great day, sure, some of the residents were a bit quiet, but still great adventure My favourite- the hippo.",
          "Spent a few enjoyable hours at the zoo. The pandas were fantastic and the other animals were very accessible. The zoo is well set up and easy to get around.",
          "Zoo is great for family with kids. Lots of animals to see. Only takes about 3 hours to get around. Wheelchairs & strollers for babies/smal kids are available to hire.",
          "The Adelaide zoo is a favourite of ours with 2 young children it is a must do you can fill in the morning or afternoon or all day if you please. Everything about this zoo will make you want to come back again and again. The animals are well looked after. The zoo is very clean",
          "Hubby and I with our overseas friends spent a good four hours wandering around the zoo, enjoying the sunshine and the animals. The otters are my new favourite animals. I never knew they squeaked! The lions were bored and sleepy. The male did roll over onto his back though and",
          "First time visit to Adelaide Zoo was great. Get there early so you don\u2019t miss out on the animals being fed. My daughter lived the pandas. Didn\u2019t find it expensive for a day out. It did get rather hot there is a lovely playground with climbing equipment. I did notice lots of",
          "A nice zoo with a diversity of animals in a landscaped setting. It wasn\u2019t too crowded either even though it was school hols. Some of the exhibits were a bit old, small and concrete-central but overall were pretty good. Maps and zoo signs could do with an update though.",
          "Last time we went, was for a birthday party where the kids were guided around by two zoo keepers who kept things interesting. Two, because when kids had to peel off to go to the toilet, one went with them (and parent) so we didn't get left behind and lost. Tour went for about",
          "We came to Adelaide especially to see the pandas at Adelaide Zoo. We loved them! We were able to get up very close and enjoyed seeing them munch away on their bamboo. The panda keeper presentation was informative and just the right duration. We also loved seeing the lions and",
          "Loved this zoo it kept out whole family ( kids 12,9and 3 ) entertained for the whole day. We all loved the pandas and got to see them feed. The play ground was fantastic and hard to get the kids away from. Food was not to badly priced but not a great range from the cafe but",
          "There are two pandas at the Adelaide Zoo and they are presently on loan for 10 years. They have been at the Zoo for 9 years so we visited from Melbourne with our daughter and her two children. I had seen pandas at the Melbourne Zoo some years ago but there was a very short",
          "Wow what a great Zoo we have here in Adelaide and so many extras The cafe was wonderful and the kids play area. The animal enclosures are great and they are always upgrading them.",
          "Superb Zoo in Adelaide city Botanical gardens. Would have to be one of the best Zoos I have seen. Plenty of animals to view, large areas,plenty of shade, food reasonably priced. Highly recommend",
          "We spent about 3 hours here and saw most of the animals. It is a very pretty zoo - quite small but I think that is part of its charm. The exhibits are really good and while the Giant Pandas the probably the stars of the show there are a lot of great animals and birds to see. You",
          "Fantastic day out. Great variety of animals and the keepers were very knowledgeable. Thought the price was reasonable",
          "Loved the panda experience absolutely well worth the money, highly recommend anyone to do this. Love the Zoo get yourself a zoo membership and save money \ud83d\udcb0",
          "We spent yesterday afternoon at Adelaide Zoo. It is a very pleasant setting with a great range of animals to suit everyone. We couldn't find the sunbears but that may have been our own inadequacy! There is a restaurant and a cafe. The food and service wasn't dazzling at the",
          "My hubby and I visited the Adelaide zoo after completing a half day Adelaide city sights tour. We caught the river boat from the convention centre and after a lovely 20min ride down the river, were dropped off right in front of the zoo. We were absolutely in love with all",
          "We spent a pleasant few hours at the Adelaide zoo. A wide selection of animals, exotic and local. The Golden lion tamarin had a over head cage run which I thought was a fantastic idea. It was really entertaining to see them running overhead in their in cages and a smart way to",
          "This was my first visit to a zoo and it will be the last. I feel awful for the animals caged for people to view. Some were stressed, just pacing up and down for hours in small enclosures . Although animals are well cared for, I really feel that keeping animals in these places",
          "Located on land that was originally Botanic gardens this amazing zoo is well worth a visit. Lots for all ages to see and enjoy here. Animals are so well cared for and be sure to catch the keeper talks if you can. A must see is the bird show with the Macaw and its low flying over",
          "See lots of very cute animals, especially the pandas, although don't plan to go in their breeding season approx midSep-mid Oct as they close the Bamboo forest. Definitely recommend the Meerkat encounter. They really care for their animals although most only have enough not",
          "I hate going to the zoo when the animals look tired, lethargic and alone and there are barely any staff in attendance. Australia Zoo was nothing like this! Staff everywhere, caring for their beautiful charges. The main show was fantastic and my 3yo absolutely loves it. My 1yo",
          "We took our grandson and was pleasantly surprised. Many upgrades and beautifications have been made in the recent years. The zoo was peaceful, relaxing, pretty, serene and most of all enjoyable. Nice to see most of the animals in their natural habitat, not concrete walls like",
          "It was certainly a wonderful time well-spent after a hard week of work. Getting connected with nature and seeing first-hand the animals having fun within the zoo was a wonderful experience for my wife and I. We did not opt for any feeding activities but were nevertheless treated",
          "Our guide Rose was amazing. Her knowledge of the pandas and the all the animals at the zoo is incredible. We had an incredible view of the Red Pandas getting their breakfast and the keeper hand feeding one of them. Then we moved onto the giant pandas. We had the lucky fortune to",
          "Booked the Feed the Penguin experience and went and wandered round the rest of the zoo. You do have to pay an entry fee on top of your experience cost, but it\u2019s worth it and the funds benefit the animals. The facilities are great, lots of different interesting animals to see.",
          "Treed, pretty gardens, great displays, super volunteer guides. Lyrebird was a once in a lifetime experience.",
          "Im not a bug zoo person but have been to some of the more famous zoos in the world and while this zoo is small in comparison its still a really nice day out. Easy to see everything in a day without having dead feet at the end of it. Nice little petting an feeding area too. Baby",
          "I have to point out to the golden lion tamarin enclosure. Great job to the zoo management for extending the cage to the trees, giving these beautiful creatures a life as close as a life they would experience if they were in the wild.",
          "We went for the teddy bears picnic/pandas birthday. Lots of extra activities for the kids like craft, stories, dress up and face painting. The lines were quite long as they usually are for these events. Not a cheap day with entry, food etc. The cafe is great though as it offers",
          "All animals are visable except some of the nocturnal ones. A few animals I had never seen or heard of before. Easy to walk around. The shows are more information sessions so you could probably skip those if you just want to see the animals. The bird aviary was the highlight",
          "Spend a day at the Adelaide Zoo. So many animals to see by following the map and arriving at the feeding times and bird shows.",
          "The introduction into the zoo runs smoothly and the availability of little push carts for children is a brilliant idea. However after visiting several enclosures to find them closed or just empty we realised the zoo was looking tired. It is such a beautiful location I think",
          "We weren\u2019t sure about going to the zoo without the kids, but won over by the recommendations of family & friends and the chance to see Giant Pandas \ud83d\udc3c Walked over from our hotel in Hindley Street via the Botanical Gardens. Had a wonderful day including Panda talk, bird flight",
          "Kids definitely love it! with range of cute gorgeous animals, a lot to learn for the children, they can also feed and pat different kinds of animals (penguins, lambs, chickens, Echidna and many more...). Will definitely come back again when we are in Adelaide!",
          "Born in city and never had a chance to do much outdoor or zoo visiting. But I definitely had such a great time in visiting this zoo. The animals are everywhere with their own designated living areas. They are so lucky to have this as their home. I start falling in love with",
          "It's a great Sunday plan! It's in a beautiful location, next to the botanic garden, so it's very green, the Free city connector stops has a stop in front of it. It is bigger than I thought. They have a special discount for students (concessions), lots of birds and various",
          "Arrived at the Zoo via The Popeye Cruise Boat and were greeted by friendly staff. The Zoo is well laid out with beautiful greenery everywhere. The animals were all active when we were there which added to our enjoyment. Lunch in the cafe was very good and well priced, highly",
          "This is definitely a must for another day soon, as time limited our stay. We watched the rhino swimming and mostly hiding underwater, but obviously enjoying his activities. The cafe provided a comfortable place to sit and rest over a good coffee and quick lunch.",
          "Had a great day out at the Zoo. Very friendly staff and volunteers. Loved the pandas. Worth the price just to see them. Highly recommended.",
          "Visited the zoo while in Adelaide and the kids absolutely loved it! My Daughter was over the moon to see the pandas! The zoo staff are knowledgeable and friendly great day out with the family",
          "Adelaide Zoo, one of Adelaide's most iconic attractions, is home to 2500 animals and 250 species of exotic and native mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Adelaide Zoo is Australia's second oldest zoo. The giant panda exhibit is home to two giant pandas, Wang Wang and Funi.",
          "We arrived early and went straight to the panda exhibit. Was not disappointed. One was hanging about in a tree and the other wandering about and munching on bamboo. The gibbons also were fantastic, very vocal. You could hear them all over the zoo. Good morning",
          "A pleasant visit for families especially with children. A joy to see children loving the animals. Pandas were terrific very active when we were there.",
          "Saw Panda sleep and eat, very cut. Recommend going for panda tour so you learn about them and the other animals.",
          "The pre-booked \u2018Panda and Friends\u2019 guided tour with guide Rob was a fantastic way to see the zoo: starting at 8.30am prior to the public opening at 9.30 you get a knowledgeable guide discussing the animals with a small group. The tour was extremely generous time-wise and",
          "Did this tour and had a great time. The tour not only takes you through the bamboo forest with the red pandas and of course the giant pandas but introduces you to a lot of the other animal as well. We saw the tiger and the recently arrived hyenas as well as other animals. our",
          "We spent 4 hours at the zoo. Great display of animals etc. Fel in love with the meerkats. Well looked after and the staff seem very caring and friendly. The trees and plants were fabulous around the whole zoo area.",
          "Had the best time,the pandas were amazing,zoo staff were very knowledgeable. Had a photo taken with them,just loved it",
          "The meerkat experience totally made our time in Adelaide. Super shout out to the wonderfully informative keeper, Mikaela and resident zoo photographer, Nicole. Ohhh, and they have pandas!",
          "I love this zoo! I have a yearly pass and I use the heck out of it!! It\u2019s got a great range of animals, and when we went the pandas were there!! I highly recommend the overnight experiences, just remember when school holidays are on, and not just for SA! Food wasn\u2019t overly",
          "First time I was visit and I was a happy time love all animals I haven\u2019t seen in Thailand , lots of kangaroo and they are friendly , wish I can go to visit again",
          "Its worth going to Adelaide just for the Panda experience. The enclosure is very spacious and beautifully kept. The Keepers are wonderful and obviously care for th Pandas. A really enjoyable experience not to be missed",
          "Great day at the zoo Pandas a must to see ..... saw them sleeping as well as feeding. Loved the monkeys too",
          "We drove from NSW to the Gold Coast and flew from there to Adelaide so we could take our granddaughter to the Zoo to see the Pandas. We weren\u2019t disappointed, it was a great day, the Pandas are amazing and the rest of the Zoo was also excellent. We had so much fun and finished",
          "Recently visited the Adelaide Zoo during the school holidays with my daughter. There were kids running out of control everywhere, parents or carers either missing or given up on their caring role. Many resident animals of long standing have recently died, there were signs",
          "I have been to many zoo's both in Australia and overseas and this would be my favourite. So well laid out and so many animals were easily visible. Maybe it was the cooler weather but the animals were all out with only the occasional enclosure seeming empty. We were only there",
          "Luckily we were gifted a yearly pass. The zoo is old, tiered enclosures are dated, dirty and some even empty. Maybe we have been blessed with visiting Australia Zoo, and Singapore zoo recently .. Adelaide just isnt worth it.",
          "A must for any trip to Adelaide - such a beautiful location right in the City yet you\u2019d think you were in lush countryside. Small enough to get around in less than a day and easy access. The animals are close and easy to see, and the Zoo\u2019s conservation efforts are prominent. A",
          "Very good. The kids area is very good to amuse them.the new exhibition are great and big and lots of room for the animals.you can spend all day looking at all the animals.the pandas are great to watch and very relaxing.",
          "Worth the expense to buy a 12 month pass which includes unlimited visits to both Adelaide & Monarto Zoo. These animals are hand reared but $$$ we invest keeps thier relatives in the wild. In my mind this is a better solution way to conserve our wildlife, and yes, I am an animal",
          "Adelaide Zoo was wonderful. The Panda talk was exceptional and very educational. The grandchildren (5-10) were quite intrigued with how they re produce. the other exhibits were not as grand as Melbourne but perfectly okay for seeing the animals. The hippo was also a big hit",
          "We went to the zoo 6 years ago and really enjoyed it. This time they were doing some maintenance work and some animals were off display. There have been some upgrades that look really good since the last visit. We did see Wang Wang and Funi (they eat in the afternoon, so its",
          "My wife & I spent more than 6 hours at the zoo & had a great time. Price of entry was 36 dollars each, which I thought was a little pricey There was lots to see, very well laid out. Staff were very helpful & knowledgable. Well worth a visit",
          "The good - compact and easy to get around! - giant pandas! - children playground was huge - can easily spend a day here with kids The not so good - variety of animals not as good as a lot of other zoos - parking can be expensive (if you can\u2019t find off street car parking) -",
          "I have had so many fun days here over the years. Watching the changes that have taken place is amazing. The staff are doing a brilliant job in caring for so many endangered animals. Thank you for all that you're doing.",
          "A wonderful zoo and a great day out for friends, couples & family. Feeding times are really good as the keepers give talks about the animals. The flight of the macaw is a must - amazing to see!!",
          "We travelled to Adelaide zoo to specially see the Pandas. They did not disappoint!! They were adorable. We choose the panda and friends tour that starts before the zoo opens to the public. It was well worth it! Our tour guide was very lovely and knowledgeable. The zoo isn\u2019t a",
          "The Adelaide Zoo used to be a great place, but now, a lot of the animals have died & have not been replaced. The pandas take up far too much room for one exhibit & most of the zoo is now gardens. Very expensive for what you see.",
          "Beautiful little gem in the heart of Adelaide. Animals are well looked after. Some enclosures are a little small. The pandas were amazing and playful. I would go again even just for the pandas. Was a nice visit and I will definitely promote it within my network of friends and",
          "We flew in from Melbourne for the day to see the pandas for our panda obsessed daughter !! We did the Panda and friends special tour and it was SO SO worth it - the pandas were eating and active and we got fabulous photos and video !! The birthday girl loves it and our guide Rob",
          "Love, love, love Adelaide zoo, has everything you could need and yet is small enough that it's easy to walk around in half a day to see everything. Animals very well looked after & you can get close enough to see. Monkey area probably my favorite, panda bears also excellent.",
          "My friend and I had a lovely half day here during our 2 day visit.We enjoyed being guided by a well informed volunteer and we had an added treat by getting close to and feeding the Lemurs.The Zoo staff are all friendly, welcoming and informative and it is well worth visiting",
          "I didn\u2019t find this zoo anything spectacular. Sure it is a must visit for families with children. I consider 36 entrance fee for adults high. Limited services inside the zoo. Good location, within walking distance from the city.",
          "Tired exhibits, depressed animals, dreadful food....all junk. No GF options. Suggest you take your own if you have any dietary requirements or if you care about your health!",
          "Just returned from Adelaide zoo, my daughter and I did 2 experiences in one day as we were flying in from Sydney and wanted to make the most of our time at the Zoo. We booked the VIP Panda experience as well as Zoo Keeper for a day. I cannot express in words what a FANTASTIC",
          "We took the plunge and booked into the Panda and Friends tour and were so glad we did. We met up with our guide, Rob, well before the zoo opened. We were able to see the amazing red pandas up close while they were having their breakfast and before the retreated to their usual",
          "I was a little unsure as to whether to visit here as I\u2019d been twenty years ago when it was looking rather sad. I was so pleased that we did go as the zoo has really changed and for the better. The animals have a much better standard of living and looked much happier in their",
          "The zoo provides a caring and stimulating environment for both its \"residents\" and visitors. Staff are most helpful and friendly. Food and beverages are reasonably priced and delicious healthy options are available.",
          "We also really enjoyed the tour with our volunteer guide. I booked the lemur experience for my friend and myself. We entered the lemur enclosure with Emma, the keeper, and Nicola from the zoo shop takes lots of photos so you can choose some to print or take home on a USB. The",
          "It\u2019s Ok, would like to see some of the animals have more space. Cost was over $90 for 2 adults 1 child obviously it\u2019s been a long time since I went as I was shocked. Some of the shows started before the scheduled time so missed out on the envirodome. Was ok but left early as",
          "Large variety of species. Panda exhibit nice. The gorillas enclosure is also nice. Some areas were a bit smelly.",
          "I visited the zoo with my husband and fed the Giraffe as something to do on a dull day in Adelaide. We were amazed at how much we enjoyed the experience, the zoo has changed so much since I was last there almost 30 years ago. Feeding the Giraffe was a really beautiful thing",
          "Have not been to Adelaide Zoo for some years, many areas vacant, have the animals gone to Monarto? Some of the enclosures were unkept and the interactive children's area lacked animals.",
          "We really enjoyed our time at the Adelaide Zoo. Conveniently located. Excellent environment. Panda enclosure was really unique. The experts from the Zoo were around to explain the behaviour of the animals. Very neatly organised and enough places to sit and relax",
          "The Adelaide Zoo has it all. Fabulous enclosures, hands on experiences, a lush and attractive ambience and full of delightful creature encounters. Mornings are best when the animals and birds are most active. They run all sorts of educational programs for school children but a",
          "Worth a visit when in Adelaide! The parking is challenging so recommend getting there another way so you are not doing laps looking for that lucky spot ! We spent a good 3 hours enjoying the zoo with the highlight being the aviary where a black cockatoo decided to come up close",
          "had a lovely day at the zoo. We wanted to do a meerkat experience but it was booked out unfortunately. We did the guided tour with a volunteer which was fantastic as my mum couldn't walk too far or very fast. The lady took her time and we travelled around slowly.",
          "The Adelaide zoo is quite entertaining and useful to know about the animal behavior. It takes you to the wonderland with fun activities of the animals. The environment is clean and tidies established in the heart of Adelaide. Panda s behavior is so sweet and cannot take eyes",
          "A great place to take visitors! We had family members visiting from the UK and they had a great time at adelaide zoo especially my nieces loved it",
          "Spent a great day at the zoo, the highlights were definitely the giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni. The exhibits were all very informative and highly entertaining. The meerkats were another highlight.",
          "The zoo is a nice size to spend an afternoon and see a range of animals. It can be a little expensive to do the close encounters with the animals and make sure to book well in advance as places are often booked up. When we went most of the animals didn't seem to be in their",
          "The main purpose of visiting the zoo was to see the pandas. The zoo is very old and historical, so this means some enclosures are not as updated or spacious as other Australian Zoos.",
          "went with our little one (2yo), and coming from QLD we have been to a few zoos already (qld, vic), this zoo is located close to CBD, however we did took a taxi to go. we also used the zoobaru kid cart hire, which only cost $15 for the day. The zoo map is a bit confusing and it",
          "We went to the zoo specifically to see the Pandas, and were not disappointed. They were just about to feed and were awake. It was a great experience. Worth the visit. The rest of the zoo is okay, but some of the animals are a bit sad to see locked away.",
          "Very wet when we arrived and expectations low . Buy poncho's and press on . Hop from cover to cover and all the animals are active and enjoying the wet . Walk down to the pandas expecting them to be tucked up in a warm bed , but no . The male was having his room serviced and",

          "Thanks to our Victorian Zoos membership we gained free entry to Adelaide Zoo during a recent weekend away. After seeing all the zoo has to offer, the admission fee would\u2019ve been well worth it! Volunteers provided lots of great care and insight into their beautiful creatures.",
          "The panda exhibit was great. Able to get nice photos up close and animals were quite active. Keeper talk very interesting and informative - learned some things. Zoo well kept and easy to navigate. Cafe food so-so and pricey, coffee mediocre. Easy walk from CBD Hotels",
          "This by far on my holiday was my biggest disappointment all the animal cages or enclosures looked far to small a poor lion was just going round and round in the same small circle. The pandas were in my view in a tiny display cabinet (im sure there was more space behind but if",
          "We walked to the zoo through Adelaide university grounds and via the river on Sunday. Thank goodness the panda's were being given bamboo as they are usually sleeping when I've visited before. An enjoyable morning spent wandering around then walking back to our hotel",
          "I've grown up in Adelaide & always loved a visit to the Zoo. I've watched it change & develop & improve & become an even better place to visit with family or even on my own. A couple of times I've joined a guided tour & that was really interesting. Food can be purchased but we",
          "Pleasant zoo to walk around with shady trees. Good variety of animal, more birds than some zoos. Number of hands on experiences as add on options ranging from feeding giraffes for $12.50 to meeting a panda for $500",
          "Had a great day out at the zoo, nice and sunny and the animals were active. Would highly recommend going here.",
          "We went to see the pandas. The zoo was easy to get around, very flat. We passed by a large playground area for children. Some exhibits are limited compared to larger zoos but definitely worth seeing the pandas. Talk was interesting. Close to Adelaide CBD. Food areas were very",

          "Great Zoo was there on opening time, was a cold morning but the sun did come out. Very friendly staff Chad was great. Alot of school kids but well behaved. Unfortunately the Nocturnal house was closed for something. But enjoyed our visit heaps. Nice cafe onsite as well.",
          "Australia is an isolated continent, so there is a very specific flora and fauna. Many animals can be seen only here. The zoo is small, not Sydney or Munich f.i., but very attractive. First You see usual zoo with traditional collection of animals like in every good Zoo: giraffes,",
          "We were out walking and saw the giraffes heads sticking up over all the foliage...across The river from where we were. So off to the zoo we went. We thought it was laid out well and there were lots of animals and birds , all very well looked after.... easily accessible for",

          "Sad to see how many animals have died and lack of room for animals zoo needs moved and enlarged. Poor male lion looked miserable walking in a figure 8 for over 25mins. There was hardly nothing on show food was over priced and lack of choices nor will they change a simple roll",
          "The Panda exhibit is worth the price of the entry. I have never seen such an extensive enclosure for 2 animals in all my trips to zoos worldwide. They are a well looked after pair. Wewere lucky to see them so active but maybe they are just so content! The other animals cover a",

          "First visit to Adelaide Zoo, whilst it was interesting I feel that it was lacking something. Seeing the lions getting fed was the highlight/",
          "Visited this zoo, for is one of the smallest we have been to primarily to see the giant pandas, as this is the only zoo in Australia that has them. We were not disappointed! The area is well set up for photography. The other areas of the zoo contains a number of interesting",
          "My husband bought me a \u201c zoo keeper for a day \u201c I absolutely loved it! Hands on with the animals was like a dream come true for me.

          "Adelaide Zoo is the smallest zoo I have ever visited. There are hardly any animals there which is a good thing because those that are there are kept in such small enclosures it is cruel. I came away feeling very sorry for them. It should not be allowed. The whole visit was a",
          "My husband and I went to the Adelaide Zoo on our trip to Adelaide, and like all zoo experiences we have had to date, we found it to be pretty stereotypical (although they do advertise conservation quite heavily). Quite expensive for what you get to see. Would be good for kids as",

          "Enjoyed the zoo but the signage was terrible. Few signs with arrows when you entered but then you were on your own. They really need to address this. Tourists are on property for a limited time and if they want to see something specific, it should be easy to find. No staff on",

          "This zoo had a good mix of exotic and native Australian animals. The paths were shady, which helped you stay cool, though the map was hard to use to navigate the park. We spent about 2 1/2 hours here and felt like we had enough time to see all the animals and birds of interest",
          "We made the trip to the Adelaide Zoo to see the Pandas. We were able to get some great photos and videos of the Pandas. The Zoo Staff talk on the Pandas was provided some great information about the Pandas. There were plenty of other Zoo exhibits that were interesting.",

          "Overall it was ok. Not too large so it\u2019s good if you have small kids. The lion enclosures made me sad as they are the old small type. There were quite a few empty or closed exhibits on the day we went. Food at the cafeteria was ok, nowhere near enough seating, queue was long but",

          "There were parents with kids everywhere when we visited, which shows the value of an inner-directed zoo. Walk-in aviaries, good signage, warm and friendly staff, many different types of animals, all make for a good few hours. I recommend about 3 hours at least. The only thing",
          "I loved the way this zoo was laid out with lots of winding paths, yes and greenery. It made exploring it a bit more of a voyage of discovery. The animals were on the whole on decent enclosures with plenty of environmental enrichment in evidence. I thoroughly enjoyed my day here."

          "Beautiful little Zoo, so easy to get around and my main interest was to see the Pandas and I wasn't disappointed. We sailed on Popeye 2 to Zoo also a lovely way to see some of the City Buildings and Architecture. \ud83d\ude42",
          "Absolutely Brilliant, 100% recommend it for a fantastic day out as a couple or family.  100% of money spent within the gift shops go directly back to the animals in the zoo to help with the cost of food.",
          "Had a good time but not many animals around when the zoo opened at 2pm. Zoo keeper told us they were a bit tied from the private event held in the morning. We still had a good afternoon as the price for entry was discounted 50% \ud83d\ude01",

          "Great zoo with easy access for prams and great gardens to enjoy as well. My kids are all little and it's the best day out. Worth getting a yearly pass for. Plus you can visit Monato zoo on the same pass.",

          "Really Great. Definitely one of the best Zoo's in Australia to stroll around. Adelaide Zoo is always a calming, relaxing experience. Very close to the city.  A great day out, Reasonable prices.",
          "As far as city zoos go, it's not bad. The kids love it and the new kids adventure playground is awesome. If it distresses you to see animals in too small enclosures, you know not to go. Had a good day myself and 9 yr old loved it.",
          "fairs quite well vs interstate zoos",
          "So close you feel a part of the action. Staff and voulenteers very helpful and friendly.",

          "Easy to navigate with a large lawned area for picnics as well as a climbing playground for the children. More animals would be great.",
          "Very interesting and some fun too! We didn\u2019t take children but would think that would be loads of fun to do!",
          "Really Great. Loads of animals to discover. Make sure you check out the Panda's their amazing. Food available from 2 places. 1 is a restaurant another is more casual with outdoor seating. A great day out. Reasonable admission prices. DO IT you wont regret it.",

          "A lovely Zoo that's easy to get around in one day. Staff are super friendly and are happy to have a chat and answer any questions whilst they're tending to the animals. The children's zoo is fabulous, where the kids can get up close and pat \u2026",

          "Great place with lots of animals. We enjoyed our experience here. However the layout of the zoo is confusing, and you would likely miss several exhibits and animals. The is no easy route to see everything. You may need to backtrack and take \u2026",
          "Very nice place to visit with children. Kids will get a chance to feed birds and harmless animals such as llama, goats and deer. The bird section is superb!",
          "great place to take the family, we had a work function after hours. The facilities and the experience were the best night out for a long time",
          "Great day out, very clean and tidy with most animals having fantastic enclosures. However I felt the lions didn't have enough space. Had lunch at the cafe where I had a nice wrap, pandas where they star of the show!",
          "Nice zoo with a really great children's play area. Probably one of the best places to bring kids to in Adelaide.",
          "Great place to drop in for free (if you are a member as I am), great new playground for the kids and good restaurant for lunch. Membership works out to similar to two visits - so if you are going more than that, it is worth it!",
          "Great :) Such a lovely place! Small enough to walk all around and kids don't tire. Brilliant day out for everyone.",
          "Small but beautiful zoo. The fact you can see entirety of place in 90min the short experience is made up by the absolutely amazing selection of animals. Thanks Adelaide zoo and all the staff, il be back next school holidays to do keeper for \u2026",
          "Visited the zoo a couple times in my life time and it's always clean, as kids even adults will enjoy themselves. It's a great walk around the zoo but it's worth it. I always enjoying visiting the seals and meerkats as well the butterfly center as well. I will have to go back and take some pictures whenever I am free",
          "Love Adelaide zoo, just as good as Sydney, maybe better not as busy.",
          "Lovely day out. Kids love it.  Pandas particularly are world class.",
          "Always a pleasure to visit this zoo. The collection of animals is small compared to the zoos in the eastern states, but the staff are friendly and the improvements are slowly coming on. Visiting at different times of day gives different \u2026",
          "A smaller sized zoo, compared to it\u2019s east coast peers. Well designed layout, with a good range of animals. The caf\u00e9 is of good standard and reasonably priced. One drawback was i thought the grounds lacked visible drinking fountains!",

          "Excellent experience. Good family day activity or something for travellers wanting different so close to the CBD.",
          "Had a great time here. Really enjoyed how shady the entire soo was. Even when it was 35\u00b0 it didn't feel like it as you could walk in the shade for most parts.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was undoubtedly an all-out Meerkat brawl which we were very privileged to observe.",
          "Every time we go,  its a different experience, my toddler  loves the zoo and loves the excellent kids adventure zone.  Great day for the whole family.",
          "We have been to several zoo's in Australia and Adelaide zoo is very average. The animal enclosures are very dated and the animals seem miserable if you can see many at all. The children's petting area had only goats when in the past there \u2026",
          "Not really much of a zoo anymore, overblown dedication to pandas.\nTwo lions only real exciting animals.",
          "What a wonderful group of animals to find here! Kangaroos, koala, panda and meerkat includes some of the world\u2019s cutest animals.... not a very big place though but you would like to visit again and again...",
          "The zoo is so worth a visit with many exciting things to see and do. Particularly enjoyed seeing the giant pandas and the big cats. Also the monkeys running and swinging in the trees. Recent renovations have really enhanced the experience of going to this zoo. Put this on your itinerary if you're visiting Adelaide.",
          "Love the zoo, a little expensive but rest assure your money is going to helping maintain the zoo itself and assist in sustainability.",

          "Surprisingly great experience for adults... Really enjoyed the variety of animals and the zoo is really very well laid out for exploration!",
          "It isn't the worst zoo I've ever been to but it's really boring. A lot of animals weren't there. Food is unhealthy. It's still a nice place but needs more and if there is a day where there are lots of enclosures closed people should be \u2026",
          "I\u2019d loved it! The zoo keepers was informative and knew the animal personality so well.",
          "I've been coming here every few years my whole life and every visit has been easy, educational, enjoyable and more impressive than the last. It just keeps getting better with each new habitat they create and the staff and volunteers clearly \u2026",

          "Such cute animals! Lots if fun facts. Very educational. .",
          "My day out here was my favorite in a long time! The best part was the giant pandas but I love how all of the animals are at the same height as you, you don't look down into enclosures, and all of the animals were visible and happy and had plenty of space! Great facilities for all ages and a beautiful zoo. Great day out!",
          "Most disappointing zoo I have visited by far, the lack of the main animals for kids to see is terrible. Also, so overpriced and what is it with CASH ONLY to hire the kids push carts to use !!! CASH ONLY in a government owned business , please !!!",
          "Animals are very well looked after and most have spacious enclosures",
          "Really beautiful zoo, lovely layout/design.",
          "Took away a good chunk of the zoo for a giant playground? Why?! Also one of the goats was bleeding from where it's horn used to be. Not great",
          "The zoo is quite small but is a lovely place to spend a few hours with your small child(ren). Heads and shoulders better than it was 15 years ago! Entry prices are a bit extortionate unfortunately",
          "Excellent enclosures. Lots of fabulous vegetation and a number of well appointed picnic areas. The children's playground is suitable for all ages.",
          "Very expensive in all areas, but the experience made up for it The pandas were very nice to see, and I enjoyed the birds",

          "Great place for kids they can really enjoy a lot of the exhibits",

          "Good design zoo with good visibility of the animals and managed to see Panda",
          "Great Zoological collection and the visitor facilities are good. A little expensive but worth it. Make sure to prepare for parking issues, otherwise take the Bus. There is a FREE City Loop bus (#98) that you can take from most Hotels in the \u2026",
          "Love the new play ground and monkey run.",
          "Absolutely wonderful place to visit for a day trip, always a good time.",
          "Good zoo overall. Though we were disappointed they didn't have any koala's. An Australian without an iconic Australian animal.",
          "Amazing Zoo. Spent over 4 hours walking round and wasn't bored once. Amazing animals",
          "Adelaide Zoo is cool. There's plenty of shady trees and picnic spots. Pandas are the favourites and the orangutan, tiger and gibbons are great. The kids playground is fantastic !",
          "The keepers are very knowledgeable, the zoo is definitely family and youth friendly, and the food is delicious (especially the chips).",
          "We havn't been in a year to the Adelaide Zoo and with all the advertising they are doing with the new interactive kids area. Went today and was a bit of a let down, the new area was nice but wasn't any staff insight to allow the kids to handle / touch animals. Except to feed the goats",
          "Was great that they accepted zoo pass from Melbourne. Lots of space for the animals but great bus ride tour to see it all",
          "Beautiful enclosures, animals kept nice and cool with sprinklers etc, plenty of shade throughout. Great variety of animals.",
          "Such a beautiful place.. but the animals haven't that much space und mostly they are alone in der arials.",
          "Magical place. The staff are generous with time and knowledge. This zoo is more than a collection of animals, it's a place of loving nature",
          "I was at the Zoo with .u daughter in law anf Grandson. I found the entry price way too expensive. I was only at the Zoo for an hour and a bit. My grandson loved the slide playgrouund and was too young to appreciate anuthing else. It was a very expensive experience for a couple of goes on the slide!!",
          "The pandas were great to see, but all the enclosures are very small compared to the size of the animals.",
          "Pandas. Just a lovely place to spend a day. Fabulous new playground for the \"kids\"",
          "Had a really great time. Well worth going.",
          "It's my cheap to get into. There are a  lot of empty enclosures. The new children's zoo area looks amazing but there are only the goats to feed. The old children's area was far and away better. Okay the playground was pretty good but you \u2026",
          "Beautiful grounds, good staff and healthy looking animals.",
          "The zoo was great,\n\nThe maps were simple to look at and plan a route with and the scenery was great. The animals and plants looked well kept, although I do have concerns about the sea lions enclosure. It seemed a bit small and drab. My \u2026",
          "Very good. But,,,,,,very very  expensive.  Way to expensive",
          "It was good. Because it was a bit hot today I didn't saw some of the animals, they were hiding. I think they should bring more animals in the zoo.",

          "Nice place to observe animals and spend time with nature.",
          "This zoo is an interesting place to explore.\n\nRAA and NRMA discounts should be used, and maker sure to bring sub protection and stay notated in the summer as you will want to stay and interact all day. Friendly staff sand good layout maker this an enjoyable peer of Monarto Zoo.",
          "Being upgraded, still a good zoo",
          "A good zoo that tries to balance between animal needs and human visitors. However you can't get away from the 19th century design and size of most of the enclosures, despite extensive work done to make it fall more natural. Enrichment \u2026",
          "It's an okay zoo. The Daily shows were short and lacked enthusiasm. Typical animal variety + panda (which we barely saw). \nOne of the lower tiered zoo's in Australia.\nDecent for children.",
          "Good value to be a member you can go for a long time or a short time",
          "Was fun visiting this zoo but seeing some animals they look sad tho :( not sure if it was just us.",
          "A great experience. Just a bit expensive. If they took a third off the price they would get double the people.",
          "Its great to see all the animals and while I can understand that all the animals have to be fed and that comes at a price, does it have to come out of our pocket? the food is ridiculously expensive, as is the entry fee. It is offputting. By \u2026",

          "Loved the zoo. \nIf you forget a pram and have young kids they have little cars that you can push around called \"zoobarus\", they were $15 but a lifesaver. My son loved the farm bit because he got to interact with the animals. The park was a bonus for him!",

          "Great to see the pandas and some other animals.but I hope that they do stick to their improvment plan as the seals do need a larger inclosure and so does some of the other animals. If they do it will be one of the best zoos in Australia",

          "Amazing well cared for animals and surrounds",
          "Great zoo, animals were very active",
          "Great first time experience with our toddler discovering all sorts of animals. Food pricing was good, family friendly and menu selection was tasty. For older kids I do recommend coming in before midday as there is a lot of ground to cover but all the more reason to come back again.",
          "Totally Awesome.\nI love the Macaws",
          "The enclosures created for the animals are more naturally looking than the bare iron cages of years gone by. Lovely to see monkeys in the huge moreton bay trees.",

          "Kids will still have fun, but the zoo is disappointing for adults. Not many animals to see. Tickets too expensive.",

          "This was definitely the highlight of my trip to Adelaide. The zoo is very well maintained and staffed compared to others in major cities within Australia (without naming). The animals were quite sleepy as the day was extremely hot however the enclosures allowed enough sight to see them easily. Definitely worth a visit for all ages.",
          "The family all loved the zoo. So much to see and do.",
          "Loved the zoo well worth a trip",

          "Had a great time here and was very lucky to have seen koalas. Well laid out with plenty to see and clearly a popular place given the amount of school groups and families visiting. Well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely gardens and of course the animals. It was a Friday but it was not clear the food outlets in the centre of the zoo were not open. We would have planned our walk differently if we knew, which meant we did not eat at the zoo, disappointing.",
          "LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!  Amazing variety of birds, best collection I have seen in any zoo! Loved the tree kangaroo experience!",

          "Went to the Zoo just after Christmas. The dinosaur exhibit was in town. Absolutely sensational. The zoo needs your support. If you haven't been down in a while, make the time and effort to take some friends or family. It's just a great day out!",

          "Great way to entertain family",
          "Currently undergoing renovations to make up for the misuse of limited space in the past. Still an enjoyable experience with construction causing minimal disruption. Hopefully the new children's zoo will put an end to the mishandling of the poor Quokkas. \ud83e\udd1e",
          "Nice zoo. Beautiful gardens. Can't wait for them to have more animals in some of the enclosures.  Some seem a bit empty in some of them. Worth a trip.",
          "Very boring for a toddler and nothing special like feedings unless you pay extra after already pay a bit to get in. Far better off going to a wild life park and hand feeding animals. Looks like the zoo is all about the $$$ sad really.",
          "Enjoyed several hours with  the family exploring the grounds. Beautiful animals, some exotic animals too! Lovely grounds, well kept, expensive food and drink though, come prepared!",

          "Well laid out with a wide variety of wildlife to see.",
          "So much to see and do. My son loved walking through the aviaries and seeing the animals out and playing! We were there a couple days before the giraffe passed away so I'm lucky my son got to see it up close! Great zoo!!",
          "really enjoyed the beautiful gardens walkways the animal enclosures and friendly staff. Had lunch with friends and we made our way around the zoo. Excellent day out. Highly recommend for families.",
          "Good zoo, kids liked the meerkats, and the playground. Apparently once a day, the monkeys scream (or start talking) and it's quite the experience how a little animal can be so loud. the day we went they started up just before 11AM.",

          "Great for all the family, the zoo has really progressed over the last few years, adding new parts and revamping old, still quite expensive, and if you intend to come a few times in a year, a season ticket is definitely a must.. The kids playground is fantastic and is great in its own right....",

          "I  have always loved the zoo, went for the first time today in 7 years. It has changed so much but is still one if the best places to go and enjoy a day out with family and friends. I just wish it was cheaper so I could go more.",

          "We came all the way from North Yorkshire in England to visit our sons and family. They brought us to your wonderful zoo/wildlife park. A great family day with much to do and the staff know thier animals. Great food as well and we will be there again this Christmas/New Year and the zoo will be on our definite visit list again.",
          "Great staff, recommend feeding penguins",
          "Where are the animals?  Can't even interact with the kangaroos anymore.  Giraffes are gone... What next?",
          "Almost as expensive as Taronga zoo in Sydney, but not nearly as comprehensive. The pandas were interesting.",
          "Hand feeding the giant tortoises was an amazing experience, and in the same visit we saw the male tiger (it may have been lion, this was some years ago) spray some visitors, so overall very positive experience",
          "I love going to the Adelaide Zoo! Good variety of animals and facilities, although it is sorta aimed more towards young children, and the price is quite high by some standards. But overall very enjoyable and love to visit once in a while \ud83d\ude04",

          "A very interactive place to get a taste of Australian flora and fauna. If you spend enough time here, you can enjoy a walk through a bamboo forest, watch lions being fed and buy yourself a souvenir to remember your trip!",

          "Seen some ants and seagulls.Needs more attention to the other animals other than the sleeping panda's .",
          "My first zoo experience in my life. Best zoo with variety of animals and birds. One can see animals related to cat family, hippos,  ducks, swans, and thousands of birds in bird house \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc22\ud83d\udc07\ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc03\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udc11\ud83d\udc34\ud83d\udc17\ud83d\udc16\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc12which is constructed within \u2026",

          "This family friendly not for profit is a great day out for young and old. The petting zoo is open for all ages which is a win in my book. Bring in your own food or buy some in there. Fill up your water bottles at the fountains to drink \u2026",

          "Our zoo is pretty good, and has taken considerable steps over the years to improve animal comfort as well as variety, while presenting the best visitor experience it can. I feel it still has quite a way to come, and there are often many areas which are vacant.  Our zoo reminds me a little of Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo, but not as good.",

        "wiki": "Adelaide Oval is a sports ground in Adelaide, South Australia, located in the parklands between the city centre and North Adelaide. The venue is predominantly used for cricket and Australian rules football, but has also played host to rugby league, rugby union, soccer, tennis among other sports as well as regularly being used to hold concerts. Austadiums.com described Adelaide Oval as being \"one of the most picturesque Test cricket grounds in Australia, if not the world\". After the completion of the ground\u2018s most recent redevelopment in 2014, sports journalist Gerard Whateley described the venue as being \"the most perfect piece of modern architecture because it's a thoroughly contemporary stadium with all the character that it's had in the past\".Adelaide Oval has been headquarters to the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) since 1871 and South Australian National Football League (SANFL) since 2014. The stadium is managed by the Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority (AOSMA).  Its record crowd for cricket was 55,317 for the Second Ashes Test on 2 December 2017 and its record crowd for an Australian rules football match was 62,543 at the 1965 SANFL Grand Final between Port Adelaide and Sturt.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nIn 1871 the ground was established after the formation of South Australian Cricket Association.During 1888 a switchback rollercoaster was constructed and was adjacent to Adelaide Oval where the present Riverbank Stand resides.In 1900 a picket fence was put in place around Oval's playing surface.\nIn 1911 the current Adelaide Oval scoreboard, designed by architect Kenneth Milne, began service.\nIn 1990 the Sir Donald Bradman Stand was built to replace the John Creswell stand and provided up to date facilities for spectators.\nIn 1997 lights were constructed at the ground allowing sport to be held at night. This was the subject of a lengthy dispute with the Adelaide City Council relating to the parklands area. The first towers erected were designed to retract into the ground; however one collapsed and they were replaced with permanent towers.\nIn 2003 two grandstands, named the Chappell Stands, after the South Australian cricketing brothers Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell and Trevor Chappell were completed.\nTemporary stands were constructed for the 2006 Ashes Series to cope with demand. In August 2008 the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) announced that it had approved plans to redevelop the ground, involving expanding its capacity to 40,000. Development plans showed a reconfiguration of the playing surface and a remodelled western stand. The redevelopment would make the ground a viable option for hosting Australian Football League games as well as international soccer and rugby. The state and federal Governments each pledged $25m to the project, leaving the SACA to raise at least $45m. The SACA planned for the new stand to be ready in time for the 2010\u201311 Ashes series. The South Australian government announced it would commit funding to redevelop Adelaide Oval into a multi-purpose sports facility that would bring AFL football to central Adelaide. Announcing an agreement negotiated with SACA, SANFL and the AFL, the Rann Labor government committed $450 million to the project.The three original western stands were demolished (George Giffen stand (1882), Sir Edwin Smith stand (1922), Mostyn Evan stand (1920s)) were torn down in June 2009 and a single Western stand was developed in its place ahead of the 2010\u201311 Ashes series. The Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority (AOSMA), a joint venture of SACA and the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), was registered as a company on 23 December 2009 following the re-announcement of the plan.  The AOSMA has eight directors, four associated with SACA (Ian McLachlan-Chair, John Harnden, Creagh O\u2019Connor & John Bannon) and four with SANFL (Leigh Whicker-CEO, Rod Payze, Philip Gallagher & Jamie Coppins).In 2010 the new Western stand was completed incorporating 14,000 individual seats and features improved shading conditions and amenities for SACA members. In the lead up to the 2010 state election, the opposition SA Liberals announced that, if elected, it would build with a new stadium with a roof, located at Riverside West at the site of the state government's new hospital location. The incumbent SA Labor government subsequently announced it would fund a $450 million upgrade and redevelopment of the whole of Adelaide Oval, rather than just the Western Grand Stand. Labor narrowly won re-election in 2010, resulting in its Adelaide Oval upgrade policy going ahead though eventually for a steeper $535 million, of which this deal included the State Government clearing the SACA's $85 million debt.\n\nHowever, in early-mid-2010, prior to the election, it became clear that $450m would be inadequate. Following the 2010 state election, the Rann Labor government capped the State Government's commitment, stating: \"It's $450 million \u2013 and not a penny more\", and set a deadline for the parties to agree.  In May, Treasurer Kevin Foley announced that \"the Government's final offer to the SANFL and SACA for the redevelopment\" was $535 million, and the deadline was extended to August 2010. Simultaneously, the SACA and the SANFL were in the process of negotiating an agreement that would enable Australian Rules Football (AFL) to use Adelaide Oval during the AFL season as their home ground. In August 2010, SANFL and SACA representatives signed letters of intent committing to the project, including the capped $535 million offer from the state government.The redevelopment included a $40 million pedestrian bridge across the River Torrens to link the Adelaide railway station precinct with the Adelaide Oval precinct, which was partially completed for the Ashes cricket series in December 2013 and fully completed ahead of the 2014 AFL season.In early 2011, the AFL, SANFL, SACA, the SA Government and the Australian Government reached an agreement to upgrade Adelaide Oval. The SACA and the SANFL proposed, if SACA members vote yes on the upgrade in early May, that the whole Stadium will undergo redevelopment, except for the Northern Mound, the Moreton Bay Fig trees and the scoreboard, which will stay as it is because of it being under heritage listing. A three-quarters majority of SACA members were required to vote in favour of the proposed upgrade for it to ahead, with a successful vote resulting in the SANFL and AFL having control over the stadium for 7 months of the year and SACA having control for 5 months of the year.\nSACA members had the choice of voting online on 28 April 2011 or attending in person an Extraordinary Meeting at the Adelaide Showgrounds on 2 May 2011. At 6pm, 28 April 2011, It was announced that 60% of SACA members that voted online voted yes, 15% short of the majority vote needed for the upgrade to go ahead. At 10.15pm, on 2 May 2011, at the Adelaide Showgrounds, the final result was announced. 80.37% of total votes cast were in favour of Adelaide Oval being redeveloped, resulting in the upgrade and stadium reconfiguration being approved. In 2012 the two grandstands, named the Chappell Stands, after the South Australian cricketing brothers Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell and Trevor Chappell along with the Sir Donald Bradman stand were demolished.\nThe upgrade commenced in April 2012. By 2014 the new Eastern Stand was fully completed with a total capacity of 19,000, bringing the overall seating capacity of the stadium to 50,083 in time for the 2014 AFL season.All stands of the Oval were redeveloped and upgraded while the already rebuilt Western grandstand (SACA and SANFL members only stand) had modifications to improve sightlines for some seats and the addition of a new media center and AFL standard interchange benches, the Northern Mound had its seating capacity increased, and the Historic Scoreboard and the Moreton Bay fig trees remained untouched. The Northern Mound, the Moreton Bay fig trees and the Scoreboard are all heritage listed and will likely never be demolished unless damaged beyond repair. This is the only manual scoreboard still operating in major Australasian cricket venues. Due to the 10-letter limit, some names had to be truncated, or be replaced by nicknames. Following a vote by SACA members in favour of the redevelopment of the oval, the South Australian government increased its funding commitment to $535 million.\n\u2020 Note that a 75% threshold was required in order for approval to be granted.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe oval dimensions were originally 190m x 125m, both unusually long and unusually narrow for an Australian cricket/football ground. The arrangement was highly favourable for batsmen who played square of the wicket, and heavily penalised bowlers who delivered the ball short or wide so that the batsman could play cut, hook or pull shots. Before the far ends in front of and behind the wicket were roped off, making the playing area shorter, it was not uncommon for batsmen to hit an all-run four or even occasionally a five.\n\n\n=== Pitch ===\nThe Adelaide Oval pitch runs North-South. Historically, Adelaide Oval's integral pitch was generally very good for batting, and offering little assistance to bowlers until the last day of a match. Since the redevelopment in 2013, a drop-in pitch has been used at the venue.\n\n\n=== Oval ===\nWith the 2011\u20132014 redevelopment completed, the oval dimensions changed to 183m x 134m, making it more suitable for Australian Rules Football, for which the playing field dimensions will be 167m x 124m.\n\n\n=== The Hill ===\nThe Hill was created in 1898 with earth from the banks of the River Torrens. The Hill for almost all sporting events at the ground is general admission and is often home to the most vocal supporters during cricket matches. The ease of people congregating on The Hill and the proximity to the Adelaide Oval Scoreboard bar is often cited as the reason why the most enthusiastic cricket supporters and barrackers choose The Hill to watch matches.\n\n\n==== Scoreboard ====\n\nThe current scoreboard located on The Hill was first used in 1911 and still shows its original Edwardian architecture. The scoreboard is listed on the City of Adelaide Heritage Register, helping to maintain the charm of the ground. There is a bar located under the scoreboard.\n\n\n=== Members' stands ===\nThe members' stands were the first section of the ground completed in the most recent redevelopment of Adelaide Oval. They retain significant portions of the original members' stand such as the brick archways and long room. The three segments are named after South Australian Cricket identities going north to south they are the Sir Edwin Smith Stand, Sir Donald Bradman Pavilion and the Chappell Stand.\n\n\n=== Riverbank stand ===\nThe Riverbank stand is the southern stand of Adelaide Oval and gains its name from the River Torrens.\n\n\n=== Eastern stands ===\nThe Eastern Stand holds 19,000 spectators. The five segments are named after South Australian Australian rules football identities going North to South they are the Gavin Wanganeen Stand, Jack Oatey Stand, Max Basheer Stand, Fos Williams Stand, and Mark Ricciuto Stand.\n\n\n== Cricket ==\n\n\n=== International cricket ===\n\nTest and One Day International. Adelaide Oval hosts some of the many exciting events in the cricketing calendar \u2014 including the annual Australia Day One Day International on 26 January (replacing a traditional Australia Day test) and every 4 years, one of the 5 Ashes test matches against England. The tests are now normally held in early December and is a clash between Australia and the international touring team of that particular season.\nIn 2011, Adelaide Oval held its first Twenty20 International between Australia and England, a match which England won by 1 wicket. Adelaide Oval was the host of the first ever day/night Test match, when Australia played New Zealand on 27 November 2015.\n\n\n=== Domestic cricket ===\nAdelaide Oval is the home ground for the first-class South Australian state cricket team, The West End Southern Redbacks and Twenty20 cricket team, the Adelaide Strikers. The Strikers compete in the Big Bash League. The Southern Redbacks compete in the Sheffield Shield and JLT One Day Cup\n\n\n=== Cricket timeline ===\n1873 December 13 \u2013 The first cricket game is played on the ground between Australian born players and players born overseas.\n1874 March 1 \u2013 England beat South Australia by 7 wickets in the first international cricket match at the ground.\n1874 November 7 \u2013 South Australia play Victoria on Adelaide Oval for the first time.

After a dispute between cricket and SANFL administrators, Australian rules football in South Australia was moved to Football Park in the western suburbs of Adelaide until its permanent return to the ground in 2014. Adelaide Oval hosted the 1889 SAFA Grand Final, the first grand final in any Australian rules football competition after Port Adelaide and Norwood finished the 1889 SAFA season with the same win-loss-draw record. The record crowd for an Australian rules football match at Adelaide Oval was set at the 1965 SANFL Grand Final between Sturt and Port Adelaide when 62,543 saw the latter win by three points. After 1973 Australian rules football matches were sporadically held at the ground apart from South Adelaide games as that club continued to used the ground for their home matches after 1973. After the advent of the Australian Football League in 1990 only one AFL match was held at the ground before it was permanently adopted again by the code, with Port Adelaide hosting Melbourne during the last minor round match of the 2011 AFL season. As of 2014, all SANFL Finals Series matches are played at the ground including the SANFL Grand Final.

          "We would highly recommend this tour. Lovely grounds and really interesting stories. The guides are happy to answer any questions and you even get to look inside the old scoreboard which is still operating.",
          "As a lover of both sport and history, I was immensely impressed with the hour long tour of the revamped Oval. Comprehensive, with the option of a roof top walk, the guide took us to all points of the ground, including change rooms and commentary suites. Excellent value at $20.",
          "I have been the Adelaide Oval to watch cricket a few times. It\u2019s a lovely ground; combining history and modern architecture. A great venue to watch sport.",
          "Sadly the Melbourne Stars lost...badly...but otherwise a superb ground. Ticket purchasing was a breeze. Staff were great. Food and bar services were very efficient - btw they don't take cash. Pretty modern ground. Very accessible to CBD centre. Well done to the management !",

          "This was a FANTASTIC experience. The staff were terrific and the guide was FANTASTIC!!!!!!! We went during an event and this made it sooooo much better",
          "New years Eve at the Big Bash is great when the Strikers win, Even better viewing position than last year, closer to the action.",
          "We drove by it, as it was closed - too late for us to see the Adelaide Oval. We stopped near a nearby lawn to look at this amazing structure. If you are a cricket fan, you must see this stadium in all its grandeur.",
          "Visited for a cricket game to watch Sydney verses Adelaide. The entrance to the oval was secure but very well organised. There was multiple food and drinks avaliable which was nice and there were ready so made it very fast food, it was over priced but as expected at this type of",
          "This is a world class stadium. Not really a bad seat, even in the nose bleeds up the back. Alcohol and food are pricey but you can bring in your own snacks.",
          "Located next to the River Torrens, amid parklands & connected to the railway station & riverbank area by a pedestrian footbridge, with regular buses stopping close by, The Oval is extremely easy to get to. Inside are the latest facilities, good views everywhere and easy access",
          "I was in Adelaide for work actually took my mum to the he cricket as she loves. The atmosphere was fantastic. The only bad thing was that Adelaide lost \ud83d\ude22",
          "Adelaide oval is superb to visit especially if you haven't seen an afl game before. The atmosphere is terrific and a fun day or night",
          "Fabulous place but the food and drinks are super expensive. More than $5 for a bottle of water is ridiculous. So, byo and you\u2019ll be fine. If you do wish to buy something, bring a credit card as there\u2019s no cash payments.",
          "Awsome atmosphere on New Year\u2019s Eve. Loved to see Adelaide strikers win. Food and drinks readily available and not very pricey so enjoyed it all thoroughly. Will visit again :)",
          "Strikers vs Tunder on New Years Eve was our choce to celebrate our 50th anniversary of meeting on a blind date 31/12/68. And of course the oval is a stunning venue and very easy to get around.",
          "What a great piece of iconic landscape. This near new building worked like a charm on new years eve with 42,000 guests to watch the Strikers defeat The Thunder. Toilets clean, food hot, lines continually moving and entertainment after the match. WELL DONE ADELAIDE",
          "I attended the Roosters vs Storm match at the Adelaide Oval in June 2018. The Facilities at the Oval are great and the whole place is really improving since the improvements they did when I last visited in 2010. Planning to go once again in 2019/ Go the Storm!",
          "We booked a box for the New Years Eve Cricket - this was the third year in a row as it\u2019s generally a good night out and we always enjoy it. However on this occasion one of our party had a fairly young child. The buffet although good isn\u2019t overly kid friendly- so I requested some",
          "This is truly one of the best cricket grounds in the world. Love the bronze statues surrounding the ground and the access from the bridge is perfect.",
          "A great 2 hours on tour of the oval by a lovely guide who carefully showed us everything at the oval. A great history lesson as well as seeing inside dressing rooms and TV media room. Worth the money, very happy.",
          "The best cricket ground in the world is also a great venue for AFL and concerts. Too large to properly host 'soccer' and rugby games as seating North and South is too far removed from the action. Very expensive food and drink. Overall a great experience and beautiful setting in",
          "Great views, great food and beverage choices, great outdoor seating area for members, helpful friendly staff, spotless toilets, easy to get to via public transport",
          "Beautiful pitch right on the river with other lovely buildings. Very nice walk along the water. The oval is massive and beautiful",
          "As stadiums go this is a beautiful one. Two things beside the actual stadium include walking across the top of the oval in a group and the gourmet restaurant which I highly recommend. A bit expensive but a breath taking view. Be sure to reserve a window table. The beef cheeks",
          "beautiful oval, surrounds are comfortable but hideously expensive and restrictive for a family outing",
          "We were easily able to upgrade our basic tickets which only allowed us to sit on the grass (booking oversight). Fantastic stadium. Dog value and an enjoyable day\u2019s cricket for two non cricket experts! Easy to go in and out. Lunched across the river.",
          "We had a great experience at the oval tour, incredible guide Alex gave us tons of info and access to everything behind the scene",
          "Thanks to our tour guide Sharee whose knowledge and passion shone through to make this tour very worthwhile...would highly recommend the tour even if (like me) you are not a footy or cricket tragic, it's a great tour and interesting history.",
          "As the title says, I came here last week on impulse, always wanted to go to a test match live and finally had the chance, while in Adelaide. Paid $30 plus transaction fees to come in, it was a really hot day, and I sat right up in the stands under those huge fans. I couldn't see",
          "Our first visit was the SANFL Grand Final. Everything was clean, tidy, orderly, well laid out and easy to navigate. Naturally parking was a small inconvenience, however a short walk through the railway station and over the expensive bridge made that walk worthwhile. Well done SA",
          "We came here for dinner and got a good look at the oval. There is a lot of history here and it has been modernised to bring up to date. Recommended, especially if you like your sports.",
          "You have to do this trip when you go to Adelaide because they have done a great lot of work and something different when you walk around the place.",
          "Went to the recent Test Match with a couple of interstate work colleagues to help show off this fantastic venue. Both had been before but not since the rebuild. Had a great day out. But the only real negative was the food and drink prices. It is a premier venue, but if",
          "This magnificent sporting ground called the Adelaide Oval is famous for International Cricket and Australian Rules Football.It is connected to the Adelaide Railway Station,which is in the heart of the city.Besides sporting events, concerts are held there and there is a top",
          "The people of Adelaide are very proud of their cricket ground which is used for far more than just cricket. I cant recall anywhere else in the world where we have been able to walk into a facility like this for free",
          "Great venue, 10 minute walk from city centre, 20 minutes from Victoria Square. Entry is free if no games etc are on, exception Shield Cricket free to sit and watch. Refreshments all very expensive, in comparison with hotel and other interstate venues, can take in non alcoholic",
          "On a hot still windless day the huge ceiling fans on roof of stands do a great job of keeping you cool with nice breeze flowing through. Beware of ridiculously high prices of food and beverages though....certainly pays to bring your own!",
          "Whilst the Australian Team has struggled after Day 1, my mate and I have really enjoyed the Test Match against India. The Adelaide Oval is a great venue with lots of space when there is only 20 - 30,000 people in attendance. Food and drinks might be a tad overpriced but they",
          "Very expensive for food and drinks, if you can bring both food and water with you, for such a great venue and it is full most of the time the prices should be better.",
          "Came here prior to do the Roof Climb which was amazing, but pleasantly surprised that it had a Bradman museum, various statues, a cafe and that you could just view the oval and take a seat. I found after visiting I have more interest and respect for the oval.",
          "This is my first trip to the Adelaide Oval since the redevelopment, they have done a great job. It is well sign posted, good seating and the facilities are first class.",
          "Outside the Adelaide Oval is stunning. Older structure combined with new and vines growing up the wall is pretty special. Inside the ground is modern and not a bad seat in the house. Fans up the top are a good idea for those hot Adelaide days Their members lawn event for the",
          "Costs $25/person but its the best tour if you have a love of all things cricket. The new renovations are incredible and well worth seeing, you get a really good look at what goes on behind the scene on match days. The highlight is being able to get in behind the old timber score",
          "This is a much hyped, yet ordinary arena, located just next to the river. While the architecture of the arena is intriguing, it's not that different from any other arenas out there.",
          "If you are a Cricket or AFL supporter, then a tour of the Adelaide Oval should not be missed. Great value for money and our tour was only two people and a guide - Thanks Jeff. The place is full of history.",
          "Great venue even if you dont like cricket. Amazing architecture and history. Great guides, know their stuff. Fantastic to see the score board.",

          "Good to walk to, lovely parkland surrounding and a fantastic venue, the statues of past sportsman over the decades adds to this.",
          "The tour guides really promote the oval. It is a modern colosseum for concerts and sporting events. A nice visit and you can walk up high by the roof for a better view.",
          "A friend suggested this tour as a great experience to do in Adelaide, and they were right. Booked it online before arriving ($25pp) picking up our lanyard pass at the front desk on arrival at the ground. We got lucky with only a small group. The knowledgeable & friendly guide",
          "Very impressive fscility and should be stop on everyone tour of Adelaide. The tour was informative and maybe just a bit too long. Really covered all the bases in some detail.",
          "As an AFL and Cricket fan I was excited to see the Adelaide Oval, I looked through the big iron gates, happy to take photos and be that close, when a staff member went past and told me I could get in for free and have a look inside. I was now beside myself as I walked into the",
          "I have been on the Adelaide Oval tour, was great to see the areas that you wouldn't normally get to see as a spectator. Have been to the Cricket and football here, loved the atmosphere and there is no bad seats. Seen concerts also and loved it.",
          "Being born and bred in Adelaide, Adelaide Oval has been part of my life. I remember going to the ground pre-rennovation and now I am a regular attender of the ground for sporting events, primarly the AFL - Go Crows! The rennovation of Adelaide Oval has modernised the spectator",

          "Saw Australia\u2019s very welcome 7 run win over South Africa in this one dayer at a ground in top condition. Impressed with Station Lane, which opened for the day speeding up the walk from the Station to the Oval over the bridge. Another new experience was the trial of a",
          "I took visitors from India and they loved the tour. The guide was good but with his head moving around towards exhibits and the oval much of the content was lost on the Indians so would suggest talking directly at people so they can hear better. The tour was really interesting",
          "If you are a cricket nut this tour is for you. Plenty of memorabilia and sights to see. Takes 1 and a half hours and at $25 is fantastic value. Young Des our guide was very knowledgeable and informative.",
          "Adelaide Oval is a cornerstone property in the CBD of Adelaide/North Adelaide on the banks of the Torrens River. Things to do include attending a cricket or AFL match, attending a concert, booking a roof walk, booking an Oval tour and visiting the Don Bradman museum.",
          "I decided to attend a Sheffield Shield game and it was very easy to follow the game from where I was seated. I also visited the Bradman collection which was well done, but wasn't game to take the walk along the roof! Coffee shop was very good too. An easy walk from the railway",
          "Good seats available for non members and one of the only stadiums around that has standing area for patrons which takes you back to the old days. Would prefer them to get rid of the old scoreboard and trees at the northern end and enclose the ground completely. The ground",
          "great atmosphere fantastic view of the game and surroundings, comfortable seating, fans on during the hot weather",
          "Great day. Tour guides were friendly. Took a little while longer but we had access to dressing rooms, media room and scoreboard. Not sure about not touching the grass but could live with that.",
          "Went on the tour to learn some history and to see the inner workings. The old scoreboard was the highlight, also seeing the actual Sheffield shield was great. George, our guide, was a font of knowledge and was a gentleman. Recommend this tour as it is a great history lesson and",
          "Only 6 of us on the tour so felt very personal. Ian was our guide and did a great job showing us around this lovely stadium. Lots of history and saw many of the areas within the stadium with some great views of the playing area. Stadium has been developed beautifully but",
          "Awesome place to watch sports a great stadium. The hill is a great feature and good position to watch football. The roof climb is good but would recommend doing it during the day time as we did it at night and the views are limited.",
          "As part of Indian-Pacific Train journey stopped in Adelaide for quick coach tour of City followed by breakfast at the Adelaide Oval. One cannot help but be impressed by this magnificent sporting venue. I can now understand why locals are so proud of this building.",
          "Attend Adelaide oval for a football game. The viewing is excellent. The poor layout for toilets and food and drinks purchase contribute to extra congestion. The cost of food and drinks are an absolute ripoff, price gouging at the very worst. Flat warm beer served in plastic",
          "We attend regular AFL metches at the Adelaide Oval during winter. This is a great venue for watching football. The major problem is that food and drinks are charged at exhorbitant costs, and I would suggest you don't buy either from the oval outlets. I believe there is a tour of",
          "If you love sports and history this tour is a must do! Came over from Melbourne on holiday and booked a tour that was informative to the extreme. You get to see the afl change rooms, walk onto the oval, checkout the media centre and my favourite bit go inside the heritage",
          "What a great insight into the history of such a fine venue. Whilst a function was being setup we still managed to see all aspects of the Oval. Most of all the history and being inside the old score board. Experience of coming from Dressing Rooms to field and what the players",
          "An approximately 90 minute tour that takes you through change rooms for both cricket and football (multiple codes), plus in to the historic scoreboard. The Adelaide Oval has an extensive history that is shared by the tour guide with numerous stories and highlights. The Bradman",
          "Well worth the $25 to book a tour (1.5 hours) of the Adelaide Oval. Guide talks about the history of the oval, we go to the AFL changerooms, then the cricket changerooms, up into the grandstands, onto the pitch (just the outer edge), and have full access into the Bradman",
          "The Oval became one of those structures that scream \u201cAdelaide\u201d. Even if you do not intend to take a full two hour detailed tour of the structure it is good to acknowledge it and inspect it from the outside. Its location is picturesque and it is composed into the landscape",
          "Had a great behind the scenes tour with Guide - Cathrine. Catherine was very enthusiastic, very knowledgeable and made our tour very enjoyable. Highlight was going inside the old scoreboard. Very interesting learning what goes on in the areas you normally do not get to see.",
          "As majority of Indians, even we are fond of Cricket and prefer traveling to places in order to back our Men in Blue brigade with our loud cheers. God granted us a divine opportunity which any Cricket fan would take it with open hands - Yes! Witnessing an Indo-Pak World Cup match",

          "This comprehensive tour of Adelaide Oval was excellent. It takes around 1.5 to 2 hours to complete and covers all areas. It takes you into the AFL team and cricket changing rooms, the old historic scoreboard, all behind the scenes areas as well as all public areas. The",

          "Wow, what an informative tour this was both for me as a local and especially seeing the Garry McIntosh Bar. I also had an interstate sports fan visitor with me who was impressed with the tour also. Our tour guide, who is a volunteer was clearly passionate about Adelaide and",
          "What a spectacular venue since the refit. Great viewing for all sports. Easy to get in on non match days for a stroll to absorb the feel and character. Great Bradman Museum. The stand climb is a must",
          "We took our 2 kids to Monster Jam and we all loved it! The sound of the trucks in that venue was awesome - it was a great atmosphere! We had aisle seats which was great with small kids! Also the new bollards outside the venue are a reassuring new safety feature!",
          "We visited on a chilly windy day and were taken on an inner sanctum venue tour by a young volunteer whose name I have sadly forgotten but not her enthusiasm and knowledge for all things about the oval and sport. I'm glad we didn't do the roof walk as it would have been very",

          "I go to Adelaide Oval for Football.. what an amazing oval with facilities to suit everyone. You can get to this beautiful oval by car, bus, tram or train..A walk over the bridges along the river, it\u2019s fantastic.. Adelaide Oval has restaurants for every occasion, formal, casual",
          "Went on the tour to Adelaide oval, they said it would be 90 minutes we walked for 2 and a half hours, it was well worth the $80 I spent for my family to go on the tour. We went all the places we could but the highlight was going into the old scoreboard and learning how it",
          "We did a 10am trip on a perfect weather day. After pleasingly passing the breath test, our guide quickly got us organised in our climbing outfit. The tour goes in total for two hours and is sensational. The views of the oval and surrounding city are awesome - it really is a",
          "I purchased an Adelaide Oval tour for my husband's birthday. What a beautiful venue. Even though we've attended many sporting events, it was wonderful to go behind the scenes. We saw the Bradman exhibition, the media centre, going behind the scenes of the iconic scoreboard and",
          "My hubby and I visited the Adelaide oval and completed the tour. Wow! What a beautiful place with some amazing history! Absolutely recommend you take the time for the tour. The Don Bradman museum was fantastic. Our guide was so friendly and made our time even more enjoyable.",

          "I dined in the Audi club with business associates and they were all impressed with the facility and service is first class. Top food on offer as well.",

          "Visited on a Friday lunch time-walked in and was able to see the ground as well as weave through a very informative museum commentating South Australia\u2019s greatest sporting hero. And the cost-all free. The \u2018Gabba could definitely learn from this.",
          "We recently did a tour of the oval as an off train excursion from the Indian Pacific. The guide was excellent and he really knew his stuff. I enjoy cricket so the opportunity to go inside the score board and all the other behind the scenes areas was fascinating. Worthwhile if",

          "Easily one of the great sporting venues in the world. I regularly attend AFL football matches at the ground from Mar-Sep and cricket from Oct-Mar each year. Such a scenic oval with the old scoreboard, hill, Moreton bay fig trees and Adelaide hills in the background,",

I don\u2019t like heights so I found the climb to our seats off putting, but once there it was fine. Drinks weren\u2019t overly expensive, but it is a cash free area,",
          "Great location. Easy to get too. Behind the scenes tour is a must. All events are good there. Freindly staff.",

          "Great venue awesome atmosphere (Go Crows) really great experience with the exception of paying almost $30 for 1 water, 1 beer, cup of chips and a cup of popcorn chicken. Eat before the game expensive compared to the likes of the GABBA.",

          "What an incredible stadium. Amazing to watch an AFL game at, ticked one off my bucket list. The pre-game light show is incredible. Food/drink and bathroom lines and prices are comparable to most stadiums in Australia. Definitely worth doing a stadium tour if you have time. I",

          "As a regular footy and cricket fan, Adelaide oval was certainly the best oval prior to Perth. While I haven\u2019t been to Perth, I understand it has its problems with casting shadows. In any case I don\u2019t think you can beat the atmosphere of a night game in Adelaide with the backdrop",

          "We all loved the climb over the oval roof. The views were spectacular and there was plenty of interesting information to learn. There were no games in progress when we went but, when they are on you are able to watch a full quarter from seats on the roof. That would be awesome!",

        "wiki": "Adelaide Himeji Gardens is a traditional styled Japanese garden, a gift from Adelaide's sister city, Himeji in 1982. It is located in Park 18 (Peppermint Park / Wita Wirra), one of the southern parts of the Adelaide Park Lands in Adelaide, South Australia.\n\n\n== Location ==\nIt is located in Park 18 (Peppermint Park / Wita Wirra), one of the southern parts of the Adelaide Park Lands in Adelaide, South Australia. The entrance is from South Terrace, between Pulteney and Hutt Streets.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe garden was originally designed by council staff, in consultation with the Adelaide Japanse community, after Adelaide and Himeji entered a sister city relationship in 1982. However, aspects of the garden's design were criticised, including its cyclone fence and lack of attention to detail.In 1986\u2013, Japanese landscape designer Yoshitaka Kumada drew up plans to refurbish the garden, which included the purchase of trees and shrubs from Melbourne, and stones from near Adelaide. After a Shinto ground-breaking ceremony in May 1987, the works began, with Kumada himself overseeing the project. The little lake was reshaped, the Sea of Sand was expanded, and the garden filled with carefully selected plants and ornamentation to complement the granite Okunoin lantern gifted by the City of Himeji in 1985.The redesign was finally implemented completely in 1989, but Kumada continued to visit each year during the early 1990s, tweaking details and teaching techniques to the council gardeners.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMany of Kumada's design principles are still in evidence. The paving stones are of a size that compels an adult walker to slow down. The garden is split into a sansui (\u5c71\u6c34), a \"mountain and lake garden\", and a kare-sansui (\u67af\u5c71\u6c34), a \"dry rock garden\", intended to evoke mountains surrounded by water, even the sea.The Council's horticulture team still use the techniques taught by Kumada himself, handed down as staff moved on. Maintenance of\nthe Sea of Sand demands careful attention, to retain its basic pattern, showing waves coming into those islands and straight lines for the ocean.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "\"South Australian Institute\" redirects here. It also became the State Library of South Australia and later, the Art Gallery of South Australia.\n\nThe South Australian Museum is a natural history museum and research institution in Adelaide, South Australia, founded in 1856 and owned by the Government of South Australia. It occupies a complex of buildings on North Terrace in the cultural precinct of the Adelaide Parklands. Plans are under way to split its Australian Aboriginal cultural collection (the largest in the world), some of which will be housed in a new building housing these along with other works of art, in a new National Gallery for Aboriginal Art and Cultures.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nThe South Australian Institute, incorporating a public library and a museum, was established in 1861 in the rented premises of the Library and Mechanics' Institute in King William Street while awaiting construction of the Institute building on the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue.In June 1856 the South Australian Legislative Council passed Act No. 16, the South Australian Institute Act, which incorporated the South Australian Institute under the control of a Board of Governors, to whose ownership all materials belonging to the old Library and Mechanics' Institute was immediately transferred.  The Act provided for a library and a museum as part of the new organisation.Frederick George Waterhouse offered his services as curator of the South Australian Institute Museum in June 1859 in an honorary capacity. When the Institute building was completed, the Board appointed him as the first curator, a position he held until his retirement in February 1882. He was succeeded by Wilhelm Haacke, who in January 1883 recommended the South Australian Institute Museum be renamed the South Australian Museum (which did not happen then), and the position of Curator be changed to Director. Haacke was appointed the first Director, but only held the position until he resigned in October 1884 after a series of disputes with the Museum's management\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe Museum Act (1939) gave the South Australian Museum autonomy from the Art Gallery and Library, and the South Australian Institute Museum was officially renamed the South Australian Museum. This legislation was superseded by the South Australian Museum Act (1976). At some point between 1996 and 2002, the Museum became part of Arts SA.In 1997, championed by state Arts Minister Diana Laidlaw, the SA Museum was funded to develop its ground floor Australian Aboriginal Cultures Gallery.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe following decade, Mike Rann, Premier and Arts Minister from 2002 to 2011, funded the redevelopment of the Pacific Cultures Gallery and the development of the South Australian Biodiversity Gallery.  In 2011 Mr Rann appointed former Adelaide Lord Mayor and Education Minister Jane Lomax-Smith AM as chair of the Museum Board.\n\n\n== Management and governance ==\nThe official role of the museum, as per the 2017/8 annual report, is:\n\n...the conservation, study and appreciation of nature and culture for the benefit and enjoyment of current and future generations. The Museum\u2019s exhibitions, collections, programs and science research activities contribute to global understanding of human cultures and the natural world as well as supporting life-long learning in the community.\nIts vision is to \"...use [its] world-class collections to create and share new knowledge, focusing on Australian Aboriginal and Pacific cultures, Earth and Life Sciences\".The Director is as of April 2019 Brian Oldman (appointed December 2013).As a statutory corporation, management of the museum is prescribed under the South Australian Museum Act 1976 and State and Federal Government regulations. The museum was a division of Arts South Australia (previously Arts SA) within the Department of State Development until 2018. After the election of the Marshall government in March 2018, the Arts Ministry was removed, Arts SA was dismantled and its functions were transferred to direct oversight by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet.The Board of eight people appointed by the Minister, as of April 2019 still chaired by Lomax-Smith, oversees the management of the Museum.\n\n\n=== New Aboriginal cultural centre ===\nThe South Australian government is committed to splitting the Museum, retaining a natural history museum on its existing site and creating a new gallery for Aboriginal art and culture on the site of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital, now known as Lot Fourteen. In early 2019 a consultation process was begun, involving the state government, the Museum, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the State Library, Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute and South Australia's Aboriginal communities, in particular the Kaurna.An update on the Lot Fourteen gallery was announced by Premier Steven Marshall in February 2020, with a scheduled completion date of 2023.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe museum houses over four million objects and specimens. Permanent galleries include:\nAncient Egypt\nAustralian Aboriginal Cultures\nAustralian Polar Collection\nEdiacaran Fossils\nMegafauna\nMinerals and Meteorites\nOpal Fossils, including gembones\nPacific Cultures\nSouth Australian Biodiversity\nWhales and Dolphins\nWorld Mammals\n\n\n=== Indigenous artefacts collection ===\nThe museum contains the most significant collection of Australian Aboriginal cultural artefacts in the world, housing about 30,000 objects. This collection, along with several others in the museum, is being digitised, with many images and a great deal of data about each item now available for online browsing.In 2016, a private benefactor, Margaret Davy AM, provided funding for a new position for an Indigenous curator for five years, which she requested be named in honour of her late husband, William Geary. This position is known as The William and Margaret Geary Curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art and Material Culture, with the first appointee being Glenn Iseger-Pilkington, a Wadjarri, Nhanda and Nyoongar man from Western Australia with a background in art curating. This was the first time in the history of the museum that a lead curatorial role had been designated for an Indigenous person, and it is hoped that the collection will be developed in a way informed by Indigenous voices and worldview, and also help to make it, in the words of Iseger-Pilkington, \"more relevant and accessible to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities\".The museum holds the biggest collection of carvings by Arrernte artist and anthropological interpreter Erlikilyika, also known as Jim Kite, who lived at the tiny and remote European settlement at Charlotte Waters telegraph station. It also holds a bound sketchbook of 24 pencil drawings of native trees, created during the Spencer and Gillen expedition and bought by Herbert Basedow before being acquired by the Museum, as well as photographs of \"Jimmy Kite\" and other related materials.\n\n\n== Repatriation of human remains ==\n\nA new museum policy has committed to the repatriation of returning the ancestral remains of about 4600 Old People, currently held in storage at the museum, to Country. Some of the remains now being returned from overseas institutions were \"collected\" by men like former Museum Director Edward C. Stirling, University of Adelaide Professor Archibald Watson and physician and city coroner William Ramsay Smith (who also bought remains stolen from burial grounds at Hindmarsh Island). However these numbers are small when compared with the vast majority of the remains, which were disturbed by land clearing, construction projects or members of the public.An Aboriginal heritage and repatriation manager, Anna Russo, was appointed in 2018 as part of a wider restructure to make repatriation and Aboriginal agency a priority for the museum. Kaurna elder Jeffrey Newchurch had been lobbying the museum for years, and SAM Head of Humanities John Carty said the Museum was one of the last cultural institutions in Australia to return ownership and management of ancestral remains to Aboriginal people.On 1 August 2019, the remains of 11 Kaurna people were laid to rest at a ceremony led by Newchurch at Kingston Park Coastal Reserve. Carty said the museum was \"passionate\" about working with the Kaurna people to repatriate their ancestors, and would also be helping to educate the community about what it means to Aboriginal people. The Museum continues to receive further remains, and together with the community would need to find a good solution to accommodate the many remains of Old People, such as a memorial park.\n\n\n== Notable exhibitions ==\nWaterhouse Art Prize exhibitions. The annual Waterhouse Natural Science Art Prize, the richest prize for natural science art in Australia and named after the museum's first curator, has been awarded in most years since 2003. Exhibitions of the work submitted for the prizes are held at the Museum.\nTraversing Antarctica: the Australian Experience (December 2013\u2013March 2014). Rare artefacts and displays highlighting the scientific, historical, and cultural legacy of Australia's interactions with Antarctica.\nShimmer (October\u2013November 2015). A collaborative exhibition with between JamFactory, the South Australian Museum and Tarnanthi, a national event held annually by the Art Gallery of South Australia to showcase Indigenous art and culture.\nNgurra: Home in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands (October 2017\u2013January 2018) Ngurra is a word with complex connotations, meaning home, country, camp, birthplace and belonging. Showed the creativity and ingenuity of the Ngaanyatjarra people of Western Australia in all aspects of their life and art. Curated by Glenn Iseger-Pilkington.\n\"Yurtu Ardla\" (March\u2013June 2019). Yurtu Ardla means wood in the Nukunu and Adnyamathanha languages. The exhibition, curated by Jared Thomas, is a continuation of the Ku Arts workshop series in 2015, which consisted of carving camps by Nukunu (of the Southern Flinders Ranges) and Adnyamathanha (of the Northern Flinders  and Gammon Ranges) and which revitalised the Nukunu carving practices. Before this exhibition, there were fewer than 20 known Nukunu objects held by the Museum, mostly made by Nukunu man Paddy Thompson and acquired by anthropologist Norman Tindale in the 1920s. The specially commissioned piti (coolamon), thiparra (shields), wadna (boomerangs), yakadi (walking sticks) and wirri (clubs) have added to the historic items to illustrate the continuation of the tradition. Roy Coulthard is a third-generation carver in his family, who visits schools to share his knowledge. With this exhibition, SAM is adopting the practice of naming artists and identifying works for their individual artistry rather than their ethnic identity.\n\n\n== People associated with the Museum ==\n\n\n=== Historical ===\nEdgar Ravenswood Waite, zoologist, ichthyologist, herpetologist, and ornithologist, Director of the SA Museum 1914\u20131928.\nAmandus Heinrich Christian Zietz, zoologist, Assistant Director of the SA Museum 1900\u20131910.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nPhilip Jones, senior curator, historian and award-winning author\nJared Thomas, Nukunu man and award-winning children's fiction author, playwright and poet, is the  William and Margaret Geary Curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art and Material Culture (from May 2018 and as of April 2019). He is also Ambassador of the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, member of the Australia Council for the Arts Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Strategy Panel.\n\n\n== Partnerships and corporate sponsorships ==\nPartnerships and sponsorships help the museum facilitate events, conduct research and develop exhibits.\nPublic sector partners have included the University of Adelaide, University of South Australia, Flinders University, the Botanic Gardens of South Australia, CSIRO and SARDI. The museum also collaborates with national and international universities.Corporate partners have included the Adelaide Festival, the Adelaide Festival of Ideas, the Adelaide Film Festival,  Australian Geographic, BHP Billiton, Beach Energy,  Newmont Asia Pacific and Santos\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Opal fossils at the South Australian Museum ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in South Australia\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth Australian Museum website",

          "A must see for all Australians and International visitors, Yidaki ( Didjeridu and the sound of Australia) Exhibition really gives an understanding of the craft of making and playing this ancient instrument. The exhibit engulfs and engages while you walk though the carefully",
          "Wonderful museum with a variety of well laid out exhibits, great to get a good idea of Aboriginal culture and Australian nature. It also shows items from the Pacific region and original exhibition furnishings from the first museum. It is well located in the city centre, next to",
          "A variety of exhibits keeps the kids excited. For a free venue, there is a lot to see. Maybe too much focus on ethnology. But great minerals collection and on the fossils of the earliest organisms discovered in the Flinders Ranges.",
          "A small museum geared to children. Very well set up for kids, not so much for adults. Good coffee though...",
          "Excellent! A good place to take the kids during school holidays took our grannies .. donation entry , very interesting and educational.",
          "When I visited, there was a special Exhibition on, 'Yidaki', or 'Didjeridu and the sound of Australia'. It appeared well patronized. The Museum also appeals to 3-5 year olds with a 'Young Explorers' programme, with dates published and bookings encouraged. While I was there, many",
          "Our visit to the museum this time was to attend a family wedding, what a beautiful place to hold such a event. From the grand staircase which the bridal party came down to our torch light tour with The Professor this night was just amazing.",
          "This is a special exhibition about what I knew as didgeridoos, but learnt there are 3 types and that these are a top end part of Aboriginal culture. It details an elder man, his grown son and younger son and their experiences with the instrument. There is film of the family",
          "As my friend was interested in the traditional life of Aboriginal people, we went to the Museum. There is a comprehensive display of Australian Aboriginal Cultures on two levels. The traditional colours from ochre were simple and beautiful in comparison to the colourful",
          "We were just walking by and thought we would take the opportunity to go in. We absolutely loved the place, just so much to see and do that we basically ran out of time. A chance encounter leads us to say that you should include it on your itinerary when in Adelaide.",
          "This was a very good tourist destination in the city. There were varied displays for all ages. A walk around the outside Uni buildings is also recommended as there are monuments and excellent old govt buildings. Lunch and walk / viewing took 4 hours. Well worth it.",
          "Visited after many years. A lot of the exhibits haven't changed however it is an engaging place for children. My son who is 2 years old particularly loved seeing all of the animals.",
          "My partner and I were aimlessly walking down the street when we decided to detour here and we're glad we did. They have a great number of varied exhibitions, with something for everyone. As a lover of anything Ancient Egyptian, I was happy that they had included a section for",
          "I've just finished a great visit here. My interests were taken by the Aboriginal and Pacific Islands galleries, especially the latter. There is a juxtaposition here between the traditional laying out of older exhibits and more contemporaneous ones. I just found it fascinating,",
          "It has been decades since I visited the museum I used to go to regularly when I was young and I wasn't disappointed. Plenty of exhibits that are unique to South Australia, especially the variety of riches from the spectacular Flinders Ranges. The Egyptian exhibit was a",
          "Great museum!!! Zero cost for entry. Worth to spend an hour or two for the visit. My kids love the history of the animals much..",

          "Lots to see and do at this museum, fun possibilities for kids as well. Interesting Indigenous People's exhibits.",
          "The staff at the museum were friendly helpful and professional. I took about 2 hours to look around and stop for a coffee. The museum is not large but there exhibits are well presented and interesting. The Mawson exhibit was an eye opener in regard to how little they wore to",
          "A good museum but not enough action, it needs some interctive displays and more movies. A simulated event like others have would be good.",
          "Enjoyed relevant information presented on the geological history of the Nullarbor plains via a presentation over dinner, among other topics.The museum is superbly presented and supported by some very well versed volunteers. It is a must to see the indigenous collections.",
          "Great museum. Has a fantastic and enthusiastic staff to help you. The gift shop is mostly local artists and loads of choice. The mammals of the world is fascinating and has some old taxidermy but still worth a visit. Children would love it! The first people's exhibit is great",
          "I joined a Quirky History tour of the museum during History Week in SA. This was really interesting seeing a few of the more unusual or special displays and hearing not so well known details about them. Tour guide was good and I will do another tour of their more usual sort.",
          "If you are in town and want a free activity especially with kids then I would certainly suggest this as an option. Situated on the nicely updated North Terrace between the State Library and the Art Gallery, most will find something of interest and should enjoy their time there.",
          "Well worth a trip, easy to find, close to Rundle Mall, helpful counter staff, excellent lunch menu friendly staff, gift shop interesting gifts, staff fantastic. Great place to take children, excellent signage all over, often a special exhibition is offered, \"Yidaki\" on now. I",
          "This Museum olf SA is really interesting in the activities provided and the helpful staff will explain or answer your queries without hesitation. The Discovery Centre is a lot of fun and will ensure you are actively engaged - for all ages!",
          "My sister and I took her granddaughter, Poppy, to the Museum, not knowing how she would react and how she would behave. She is a very well behaved, almost 3 year old and very inquisitive. It was in the school holidays, so, many, many children with adults were there. Where does",
          "A huge amount of aboriginal artefacts dominate the museum which I great for overseas tourists but as a local I was really looking for something more. Kids seemed to enjoy the mammals and aquatic areas. Ancient Egypt room was a huge disappointment unfortunately. Would only really",
          "Located in a historic building next to the Art Gallery in Adelaide city. Parking is sometimes difficult. Free entry. Aboriginal and PNG collection is awesome. Also Precious stone collection is wonderful. Kids like the coin operated T-Rex. Good educational place for kids. Can",
          "The museum is free and is in a great, central location. The exhibits are outstanding and although I visited for about three hours, it was not nearly enough. Highlights included: 1) A fabulous presentation of very early fossils, the Ediacaran fauna, pre-cambrian, clearly",
          "I've been going past the museum on a daily basis for a couple of years and finally made it inside, attracted by the Quirky History tour during the History Festival. I highly recommend it - this is actually a good way to sample the museum at the same time, since you go through",
          "My wife wanted to go shopping so I looked for an alternative interesting experience while visiting Adelaide. The museum filled the bill and I particularly enjoyed the geology section with its fossil display, the meteorites display and the Australian indigenous peoples display.",
          "Having been reunited with our Rellies who left the UK in 1971 as \u00a310 Poms, we concluded our all too short visit to them and their grown up children in Adelaide at this most wonderful museum.",
          "Located in one of the building. Again, wonderful architecture. The museum has 2 main sections : ancient wild animals and Aboriginal artefacts. If these are your interests, then it is worth paying it a visit.",
          "We walked into the museum after reading good reviews and we were completely underwhelmed. We decided in the end to go to the top floor and look at the mineral and crystal section. That was quite interesting but the lighting was very weird, so that some exhibits you could hardly",
          "Toddler approved. He loved the bees the best, but overall a really good museum for a free rainy day outing.",
          "This is an important museum to visit, located in a lovely building on museum row. The Aboriginal galleries (two floors of them) are impressive, with artifacts that tell the story of the daily life of the First People of Australia. Paintings by contemporary Aboriginal artists",
          "Being used to the Melbourne Museum I was pleasantly surprised that entry was free here (although donations were encouraged). In spite of this the place was relatively empty which provided space to roam around and enjoy the delights located within. The free floor plan was very",
          "Great few hours there very interesting and the had a special Indiginous thing at the time which cost money to see however it was worth the money and enjoyed by all",
          "This is a must for an Adelaide visit. The galleries are well-crafted and the material presented is fascinating. You may want to visit twice! There is a small shop and a caf\u00e9 - take a break and then go back for more. We especially enjoyed the prehistory and the Aboriginal",
          "Spent about three hours here lots to see. They have a cafe and gift shop. Free to get in and great displays.",
          "Spent most of my time in the aboriginal displays. Just happened to start in that section first and was fascinated at the large and varied items on display. Very impressive indeed. The detail on their tools and adaptations for their harsh environment plus the decorative touches I",
          "Excellent museum. We thought it had the best Aboriginal exhibits we saw during our two week stay in Australia. When you go in get a brochure or a guide, if available. Depending on how much time you have you can skip some of the more normal museum displays like the stuffed",
          "This museum would typically suit a family with kids. However, the aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders section is a must for anyone who has even only a remote interest in our 'first people'. The collection is brilliantly set up, explanations are captivating, displays",
          "I finally got to go to the museum but couldn't get into part of it with the insects and gems, It said the hours on the door and I was there within those hours but the door wouldn't open. Oh well wasn't meant to see that part I guess. Most of what I did see was interesting",
          "I now check the SA Museum when I come to Adelaide to see what is on and in April is a wonderful exihibtion YIDAKI the sound of Australia's didjeridu. it is special for what it tells us of the history, the culture and the playing of this ancient musical instrument. The",
          "We particularly came to this museum to see the Australian Aboriginal Cultures exhibit, which was well worth the visit. Over two floors, the display was vast, educational, and impressive, and I understand it is the most comprehensive of its kind in Australia. We also made time to",
          "The good thing is, that all the fine museum's are in walking distance. Close to the botanic garden and the casino. This South Australian Museum is a wonderful location. A place to think and to relax . The cafe and shop has a good variety. Friendly service and a good place to",
          "Its a free museum and is definitely worth a visit. My recommendation would be the Aboriginal exhibit on the lower level and the marine exhibits!",
          "My partner and I went to the Yidaki exhibition a couple of weeks ago. We paid $34. Once in, we quickly realised that we had wasted our money. This exhibtion was poorly curated and was an absolute embarrasment to be representing such an important part of the Aboriginal culture,",
          "Lovely museum with an interesting selection of artefacts. Particularly loved the Giant Squid exhibition - really well done! The Discovery Room was also excellent. So many amazing things to look at! The collections, whilst great, could do with updating in terms of display and",
          "The SA Museum does not attempt to explain the European history of SA. It leaves that to the Migration Museum and the Maritime Museum. Instead the SA Museum has chosen several (some perhaps strange) topics for its collections. It has the largest and most comprehensive collection",
          "A great collection of some of the interesting things unique to South Australia, as well as some truely rare experiences. See what working in Antarctica is like, or see meteors which have crashed to earth. Measure yourself against a giant squid, or see one of the only Egyptian",
          "Spent all afternoon wandering around all of the exhibits, they are so interesting and a great display of the Aboriginal history. The display of Douglas Mawson is so worth looking at.",
          "Last went there for the opening of an Aboriginal exhibition during the fringe. Always visit the Mawson exhibition, and know people come from interstate to see it.",
          "Much of the museum is devoted to the rich Aboriginal history of Australia couples with extensive displays of fossils and minerals, so it makes the museum a more interesting place to visit than your normal run of the mill museum.",
          "Did the tour and had Lynne as our tour guide. Definitely worth doing as you gain so much more from the experience. Need about 3 hours here. Tours are at 11am and 2pm and are free.",
          "We popped into this special exhibition at the Museum while in Adelaide for its fabulous Festival. It's a very touching experience. The displays include stories told by members of an indigenous community on the east Coast of Arnhemland. The grandfather who speaks most is a",
          "A FREE experience with loads of fun stuff. Our mature aged interstate visitors found the skeletons and Egyptian room most interetsing. HINT: Don't forget to sit and watch the lion in the glass cage for a surprise!",
          "Visiting Adelaide for the Fringe, we decided to visit the South Australian Museum and I am very glad we did. Exceptional Museum with a huge array of Aboriginal artefacts as well as interesting collection of fossils that rivals the Natural History Museum in London. By far the",
          "2pm tour guide enhanced our experience of the important indigenous collection 200% and more with her enthusiastic and knowledgeable tour. Thankyou .",
          "This is a good all around museum but it has a good section on aboriginal culture and history. Well worth the visit.",
          "Love visiting the museum! The kids love interactive displays and the animals. The only issue we had are the security staff that just follow you if you have young children, no matter how well behaved they are. It can be a bit intimidating.",
          "An interesting museum, which focuses on natural history, well worth a visit on a rainy day. The pacific exhibits area is extremely dated and the museum apparently wishes to modernise this part, if funds are available. Well worth a visit",
          "This museum is a great way to spend a couple of hours while visiting Adelaide. The museum is free. It is centrally located near the art museum and the Immigration Museum.",
          "I have never allowed enough time when visiting the museum, so this time I made several trips. I don't think you can do the collection justice in a one day visit. The exhibition from the British Museum was brilliant. The Discovery Centre staff were very helpful and followed up on",
          "So much to see and learn from the SA Museum! Visit there often at the request of kiddies... historical animals and the giant squid a must see. Kids can interact in most sections and a cafe downstairs for the after walk cuppa!",
          "What a good interesting museum, very close to city centre. A variety of interesting things, natural history, geology, opal details, and a lot of aboriginal history, and art work",
          "Set near the city this is a pleasant way to spend some time when you are in town - learn about how the area was designed and settled",
          "This is a free attraction and is very worthwhile. In this modified heritage building you will see some amazing exhibits including live green frogs, European animals, anfnamgiantnsquid. We took our 2 year old and she was mesmerized. On top of that it's very well air",
          "Easily navigated one walks past the whale skeletons into a well organised museum with perhaps the best Australian Aboriginal exhibit in the country. Don't miss the live bee hive,the giant squid and the amazing opalised Plesiosaur skeleton. Nice interactive exhibits for the",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the museum and were surprised to find it free. The tour guides were friendly and informative. There is a good number of aboriginal artifacts. There is a giant squid. So large it fits in an elevator shaft over 4 floors. There is an unqualified geological",
          "Whole our family loved this place and honestly this is for at least 2 visits when you stay in Adelaide. It's huge, so much to see so just for one visit is really overwhelming. If we would stay more days in Adelaide we would definitely go back. Kids just loved it!",
          "I love the SAM. Always loved museums, and as a Gen X'er remember them with frayed animals rather than being all push-button suave techno-gadgetty. SAM, after a recent refit, meets both criteria beautifully blending the old school with new ideas. The mammal galleries are straight",
          "Very good interactive and audio visual displays of South Australia's history as well as Antarctica, and an Egyptian room",
          "I particularly enjoyed the aboriginal section, a wide range of spears, shields and tools are shown, with some interesting reads about how and when they were used. The decoration on Shields and boomerangs are amazing! I'm not a fan of the animal section but it was pretty big if",
          "As a child I visited the museum many times with my father. Now I am always pleased to share experiences with my grandson. We visited . The fine collection of 'stuffed' animals is much the same. The Antarctic display is well done. The collection of spears and shields were",
          "The artifact collection was not only extensive, but was organized in meaningful ways and presented with sound, videos, clear labels, and clear glass protective cases, with vintage and modern photos and examples of how various aspects have evolved, and with attention to",
          "Has a great exhibition of Mawson and the Antarctic, Australia's mega fauna and Australia's aboriginal history as well as a little look into ancient Egypt. Well worth the visit.",
          "This is a wonderful museum, one of the best natural history museums I have seen. There are so many interesting displays covering a wide range of topics, it will take more than half a day to go through all I guess. There are lot of information and interactive activities for all",
          "Really enjoyed this museum full of wonderful stories,memories, nostalgia the list is endless take a trip and reminisce",
          "Clean and informative museum with tons of exhibits of wildlife. A great educational place for both children and adults. The museum is located in the city.",
          "The Museum has one of the best Indigenous collections anywhere. The interactive screens provide extensive relevant information. The second floor with its fish is particularly well set out for children. The staff in the Discovery Room are exceptionally well informed, helpful and",
          "I was hoping to see my mother in law in the museum but there were things older than her. What an experience and what a collection of Artifacts from all over the world the animal collection is a treat until you see one of them move - aboriginal collection was a real eye opener -",
          "To see everything in this Museum in a year you will need to view 10,000 or so items every day. On this visit we spent time in the Discovery Centre on first floor. A highlight is the working bee hive. I was also able to identify some creatures we see in our garden. There are",
          "Free to go in,lots of things to look at.Inside it has a small coffee shop.Great gor everyone.You can go to the top floor at look down and see a giant octopus. Very clean inside.",
          "So many displays over several floors. The opalised fossils and the Ediacra Biota are must-see exhibits in Adelaide.",
          "Like most museums, the SA museum does what it promises. Shows you old stuff. There's some great exhibits including the giant squid, the rocks and gemstones and the aboriginal display. But nothing to \"standoutish\". All in all, for a free entry it's worth the visit.",
          "When i went there, i came face to face with some of the worlds most extinct species of stuffed animals. It is really something special to see so much history! Had a blast getting to experience what the world was like before my time :)",
          "The museum is a great place for all to visit with things for all ages and the best thing is it is free entry :)",
          "Great museum with some excellent displays suitable for the whole family. And Free! Bonus! Check out the Mammals display and head upstairs to see the polarised dinosaur fossils.",
          "Situated very centrally and next to the Art Gallery of SA this museum has a wide range of exhibitions spanning anthropology, geology, ecology and more. The displays are well presented and the little discovery centre always has my 4yr old enthralled. We often head here when it is",
          "Historical building, conversion is quite good. Went to the \"curious beasts\" show and the way the birds and animals were displayed were really weird and to be honest were not very kids friendly as little girls were frightened to cry. Overall the displays are bit old fashioned",
          "Free museum great exhibits. Loved the Lions tail. Great selection of stuffed animals. Opalised dinosaur bones were my favorite and the great minerals collection.",
          "A well laid out exhibits with easy access and proactive displays. A lot to see in one sitting so we saw it over two days. Well done.",
          "The last time I visited this museum was for an excursion in year 3. Walking into the museum more than 35 years later and it feels like nothing has changed. There are still lots of animal skeletons and stuffed animals. The young kids in the museum were obviously enjoying this",
          "A great and informative place to visit. The two levels of Aboriginal artefacts exhibits was most interesting. It was spacious so families with prams could move around easily.",
          "We visited the museum for the first time since we were in school. They have an impressive display of numerous animals and some interesting informative displays too. My partner and I decided that we prefer to see animals alive though.",
          "We had a great afternoon visit to the Museum looking at all the 'spooky' exhibits with a paleontologist. He gave us the history behind the displays.",
          "We join the guided tour and got a very good guide who can explain about the collection very interestingly.",
          "For at state capital expected better. Good aboriginal and south pacific displays. Not a lot of interactive and innovative exhibits for children.",
          "Had high hopes when I entered but apart from the Aborigine exhibits it would seem South Australia has very little history at all! I would however recommend the museum shop for probably the best selection of tourist shopping in town, so the visit was not entirely wasted.",
          "I found the Aboriginal collection really interesting, what a divine collection. It should be even greater... The thing that really really really annoyed me is the shop that is full of crap made in China being passed as Aboriginal (ie. fake boomerangs).... So, how can you have",
          "The variety of displays is impressive, you can spend a couple of hours here. In particular the Aborigines section is highly interesting. For a refreshment, the restaurant I can highly recommend the restaurant.",
          "The Museum has a lot of interesting exhibitions including Aboriginal Life which is fascinating in itself. The Museum Staff offer free tours of this particular aspect of the Museum which are very informative. There is a cafe and a shop selling things related to the current",
          "My favourite part of this little sightseeing tour was the marine sea creatures section and the big jellyfish which was extremely interesting to see. I suppose what this museum follows is all very similar other museums across Australia.",
          "Went in as I had to kill a few hours. Loads of school kids in tow. Great section on Polynesia and Abroginal culture and presence. Two hours was too little. Plan to go again and take my time over a lovely museum. Free enterance as well.",

          "We visited the museum on a very hot day, thinking we would just get out of the sun for an hour or two but what we found was an amazing collection of aboriginal artefacts and information about the culture and history of aboriginal people in South Australia. It really was the",
          "A fantastic museum full of history and culture. I just love this museum. Don't forget to check out the GIANT squid. Awesome Egyptian area. Aboriginal area. Dinosaur bones. Insects area fantastic. I could go on and on but it's truly a terrific place to lose a few hours deep in",
          "A great place for kids to enjoy. Aged 3-10 mine particularly like the animals on the ground floor (watch the lion wag its tail!). The coloured rocks &gems are another favorite as are the underwater parts and Icey wall you can touch. The giant squid is an all time favourite. The",

          "I particularly came to see the Opal exhibition and thought it of great interest. You had to pay for the entry to this which I thought was quite expensive, really enjoyed the exhibition and beautiful stones on display. The rest of the museum I believe was free and I had a quick",
          "Great museum, free entry, and thoughtful displays. Interesting to see some of the remaining Victorian cabinets of South Sea exhibits - very thought provoking about how Victorian white Europeans viewed their neighbours. Super cafe as well.",

          "Great museum right in the heart of the city. Helpful advisors and lots of pamphlets available. Exhibitions are very informative and we enjoyed the aboriginal section of the museum",
          "Take this kids, or wander around on your own. This place has so much on offer, you can loose yourself for hours on end. The displays are well set up, maintained, and clearly labelled. Even with school groups going through, there was plenty of space to not get crowded. The",
          "Great activity for a cold and windy day. The exhibits were very well laid out and documented. Very interesting place to visit.",
          "Because Adelaide is a smaller city, I did not expect to see such a great museum. It should not be missed!",
          "A great way to pass at least an hour with 3 floors of multiple exhibits (dinosaurs, indigenous cultural items, glistening stones, minerals etc) and even a Discovery Centre with reptiles and a working bee hive.",
          "It is located on North Terrace. It is free entry or you can leave a donation entry. Its suitable for all ages. It has a variety of displays. A must when visiting Adelaide.",
          "What it has in its collection, the museum displays well. I've travelled the world and lost count of the museums and galleries I've seen- some are so overwhelming with the extensive collections that you can never really absorb in their entirety We visited twice- the first day",
          "We did not think much of Adelaide but this museum was the highlight. Very nice natural history and collection of aboriginal artifacts.",
          "The highlights of this museum for me were the Edicarean era fossils on the top floor, and the aboriginal artificacts on the bottom two, not to mention the giant squid on all four floors.",
          "This was an excellent place to visit especially with a family. The group tour was an hour long and depending on your tour guide what was highlighted. We had Peter and he was focused on the geology, fossils and minerals of SA. The marine section was also excellent. The Aboriginal",
          "This museum is small with quite specific exhibits about Aboriginal and Pacific cultures and biodiversity of South Australia. Exhibits are fascinating and well done.",
          "I was accompanied by someone who was not really keen on visiting the Museum with me,but once there really enjoyed their visit and in fact on our next visit to Adelaide they have put it on their list to do it again as our time there was a bit short and they want to see more.",
          "Poking around the city on a rainy day. Many people with kids visiting the museum. So much to see. Very impressed.",
          "I this Museum quite and well worth the visit. The old buildings really lend itself to the 'old' feel. I didn't have my kids with me, but would CERTAINLY take them.",
          "The SA Museum (we call it SAM) is in a beautiful old Victorian building on North Terrace, Adelaide's cultural boulevard, between the State Library and the Art Gallery of SA. I believe it has the world's largest collection of Australian Aboriginal artifacts, and you can tour this",
          "A well set out museum offering free entry (to the main halls) and with a caf\u00e9 and shop near the entrance. Not a standout, but pleasant enough",
          "We dropped in for something to d on a wet day and ended up spending a very entertaining few hours browsing the exhibits. This was an excellent way of getting to know a bit about the indigenous culture and the local fauna in a wider context. When we got tired the cafe gave a",

      "name": "Rundle Mall",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Rundle Mall is a pedestrian street mall located in Adelaide, South Australia. It was opened as a pedestrian mall in September 1976 by closing the section of Rundle Street between King William Street and Pulteney Street, to vehicular traffic. The street continues as Rundle Street (as before) to the east and Hindley Street to the west.\nThe pedestrian mall has become the centerpiece of Adelaide's city centre, home to some of the most expensive real estate (per square metre) in the state. It competes with the large shopping complexes in the suburbs, (e.g. Westfield Marion, Armada Arndale Shopping Centre, Westfield Tea Tree Plaza, etc.) In 2009, retail space directly on the mall leased for up to $3,700 per square metre per year.The mall is home to the South Australian flagship stores of many large Australian retailers and many smaller independent and chain stores. The mall also features a number of arcades and plazas containing smaller boutiques and eateries. These include the Italianate-style Adelaide Arcade (also being the first retail establishment in Australia with electric lighting, and allegedly home to six ghosts), Regent Arcade, Gay's Arcade, City Cross, Southern Cross, Adelaide Central Plaza, Myer Centre, Renaissance Arcade, and Rundle Place.\nThere are usually several buskers performing in the mall, licensed by the Adelaide City Council. The mall's stores are generally open seven days a week.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRundle Street, from which the mall takes its name, is named after John Rundle, a member of the British House of Commons and an original director of the South Australia Company. The street was named on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee. In 1895, the first electric street lighting was installed at the intersection of Rundle Street (as it was then), King William Street and Hindley Street. It also had a tramline run through it when it was still part of Rundle Street.\nIn November 1972, the then South Australian Premier, Don Dunstan, issued the closure of the western part of Rundle Street to create Rundle Mall, due to extreme congestion caused by traffic and the increasing number of pedestrians. It opened on 1 September 1976. Other than police and other government vehicles, drivers need permission to drive on the pedestrian strip. The mall is a dry zone as well as a smoke-free zone.\n\n\n== Notable sites ==\n\nThere are several items of modern sculpture in the mall. The best-known is the 4 metre tall The Spheres by Bert Flugelman; two large stainless steel spheres with a diameter of 2.15 metres balanced one on top of the other. They are most commonly referred to as the Mall's Balls or Rundle Mall balls. \"The Mall's Balls\" are a common meeting place for visitors to the mall. Erected in 1977, they were commissioned by the then Hindmarsh Building Society (subsequently absorbed into the Adelaide Bank) and donated to the City of Adelaide to mark the building society's 1977 centenary.\nOther sculpture includes a group of life-size bronze pigs \u2212 Horatio, Truffles, Augusta and Oliver - rooting around a rubbish bin. \nOf note is the historic Beehive Corner, completed in 1896. It lies at the western end of the Mall, on the corner of King William Street, and was originally owned by John Rundle. Beehive Corner is built in the Neo-gothic style, which is generally reserved for churches. The Mall also contains a fountain (The Fountain) that is painted in Victorian colours and was cast in the late 1800s.Not to be left in the dark, Rundle Mall also boasts the ELITEM Rundle Mall Super Screen\u2014a 35SQM P12 LED display which broadcasts city and state notices as well as other local business messages. Another noteworthy large lighting display is the Rundle Lantern which marks the eastern end of Rundle Mall and the beginning of Rundle Street.\nTowards the end of 2014, there was work being undertaken to demolish the caf\u00e9 which was located near the junction with King William Street, and build an open area replete with benches. The Adelaide City Council info centre was also relocated to the other end of the strip. More work was completed toward the end of 2014.In 2013, there was giant cockroach statue added to the mall. This statue was salvaged from a junk yard and cleaned up, before being placed in the mall. Police reported two men for dragging the statue six metres along the mall.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn 1995\u221296, the mall received its first major upgrade. The upgrade saw most of the mall's fixtures replaced and the erection of permanent market stalls down the centre of the mall. The market stalls were later demolished as part of a 2013 redevelopment.There were also some escalators in the middle of the Rundle mall in the 1990s, but this was taken down later. In 2013, the Adelaide City Council commenced a $27 million upgrade of the mall that was completed in four stages over a 16-month period. New paving, benches, trees, bins, a multi-purpose structure and ground services were installed. The Rundle Mall master plan also included a catenary lighting system to be supported by four 20m poles at either end of the mall and brackets on a number of building facades.In June 2015, it was announced that an additional cost of $3 million was required to complete the lighting system and to undertake further storm water works in the mall.The catenary lighting system for the mall was completed in November 2015 after being delayed by several months.\n\n\n== Buildings and tenants ==\n\nThe majority of buildings on the Mall contain a small number of retail tenancies.

        "wiki": "Victoria Square, also known as Tarntanyangga (formerly Tarndanyangga) (Kaurna pronunciation: [\u02c8d\u032a\u0325a\u0273\u0256a\u0272a\u014b\u0261a]),  is the central square of five public squares in the Adelaide city centre, South Australia.\nIt is one of six squares designed by the founder of Adelaide, Colonel William Light, who was Surveyor-General at the time, in his 1837 plan of the City of Adelaide which spanned the River Torrens Valley, comprising the city centre (South Adelaide) and North Adelaide. The square was named on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee after Princess Victoria, then heir presumptive of the British throne, and in 2003 assigned a second name in the language of the original inhabitants, Kaurna, Tarndanyangga (later changed to Tarntanyangga), as part of the dual naming initiative by the Adelaide City Council.\nThe square has been upgraded and modified several times through its lifetime. During the Christmas period, it is traditional for a 24.5-metre (80 ft) high Christmas tree to be erected in the northern part of the square.\n\n\n== Dual naming and significance ==\nThe square was first named \"Victoria Square\" on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee, in honour of the then Princess Victoria.\n\nIn line with the Adelaide City Council's recognition of Kaurna country, the square was officially referred to as Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga from 2002, modified to Victoria Square/Tarntanyangga by 2013, when Stage 1 of a major upgrade was done.The name \"Tarndanya\" (or variant spelling) was the name used by the Kaurna people for \"the site of South Adelaide\", and \"Dharnda anya\" was used as a place name in the Adelaide area; there was a \"Dundagunya tribe\" whose central camp had been \"in or near Victoria Square\". Tarndanyangga/Tarntanyangga is derived from the Kaurna word for \"red kangaroo\" \u2013 tarnta (tarnda)  \u2013 and that for \"rock\" \u2013 kanya. The ending \"-ngga\" means it's a location, implying \"in, at or on\", which is often used in Kaurna place names. Many quarries were built on the southern bank of the Torrens, and Tarnta Kanya probably referred to one or more rock formations which were quarried, providing much of the stone for the large early buildings on North Terrace.Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga is still considered an important meeting place for Aboriginal Australians. It is the focus for many political and community-based Indigenous events, such as the National Sorry Day commemoration held by Journey of Healing (SA) on 26 May each year. Each year during NAIDOC Week in July, there is a \"family fun day\" held at the square and a  march to Parliament House.The Australian Aboriginal Flag was flown at Victoria Square for the first time in the country at a land rights rally in Victoria Square in Adelaide on 9 July 1971. On 8 July 2002 the Adelaide City Council endorsed the permanent flying of the flag, which now flies adjacent to the Australian flag.\n\n\n== Description ==\nVictoria Square is in the centre of the city's grid plan, designed by William Light. It is bordered by numerous public institutions at its north and south ends, including the Supreme Court of South Australia, the Adelaide Magistrates' Court, the Federal Court of Australia, the historic old Treasury building (now a hotel run by the Adina hotel chain) and the former Adelaide General Post Office.\nOn the eastern side is the Roman Catholic Cathedral Church of St Francis Xavier, the SA Water headquarters, State Government offices, including the office of the Premier, and the Torrens Building, which houses the Carnegie Mellon University.\nThe west side of the square contains more commercially-oriented buildings, including an entrance to the Adelaide Central Market, the Hilton hotel, and the offices of various consultants, law firms and insurance companies.\nKing William Street passes through the centre of the square from north to south, creating a diamond shape, with the southbound carriageway passing through the east side, and the northbound carriageway passing through the west side of the square. The square is bisected on its east-west axis by the section of road (technically part of the square) that connects Wakefield Street (entering from the east) with Grote Street (to the west).\nA tram stop (formerly the terminus) for the Glenelg tram line is just south of the Queen Victoria statue; it was shifted from the centre to the western edge of the square in 2007, as part of the extension that was made to the tram line around that time.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe link between the Aboriginal people and the square, as a centre for the surrounding area, stretches back many centuries, to a time when Tarndanya (Red Kangaroo Dreaming) people gathered there for special ceremonies and dances. Tarndanyangga was the \"headquarters\" or central camp of the \"Dundagunya tribe\", a community numbering in the thousands. During the 1960s the Aboriginal community renewed its activities in Victoria Square, with the area in front of what was then the central Police Station, (and is now the Commonwealth Law Courts building), becoming a social and gathering point.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1837, the first Surveyor General of South Australia, Colonel William Light, mapped a plan for the City of Adelaide. The design incorporated a central square to function as Adelaide's focal point and provide open space for recreational activities. On his first map, Light called the precinct \"The Great Square\". It was eventually named in honour of Princess Victoria, then heir to the throne of England.The square was a dusty, treeless paddock until 1854, when the Adelaide City Council embarked on a planting program, constructed four broad diagonal pedestrian paths and erected a wooden fence. The landscaping work was designed by George William Francis, later the first director of the Adelaide Botanic Garden.Other work on the square included construction of an east-west roadway that created two garden areas. A fountain was also considered, but it took a further 100 years for this idea to come to fruition. By 1883, plans were under way to extend King William Street directly through Victoria Square, dividing it into four garden areas. The original wooden fence was replaced by ornate iron railings. A statue of Queen Victoria \u2013 who had ascended to the throne in June 1837 \u2013 was erected in the centre of the square in 1894.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe statue of Colonel Light, now known as Light's Vision and since 1938 situated on Montefiore Hill, was unveiled on 27 November 1906 in its original location at the northern end of Victoria Square.The original tram terminus was located outside the Charles Moore & Co. department store with services operating via a loop in an anti-clockwise direction in the south-western corner. As part of the rebuilding of the square, in December 1966 the tram terminus was relocated near the centre of the square with Grote and Wakefield Streets to the north and Gouger and Angas Streets to the south.The layout remained unchanged until 1967 when the square assumed its present diamond form. The Three Rivers Fountain by John Dowie was built to commemorate the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, in 1968. The three South Australian rivers, the Murray, Onkaparinga and Torrens, are represented by an Aboriginal male with an Ibis, a female with a heron, and a female with a black swan. On 12 July 1971, the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag designed by Harold Thomas was flown for the first time \u2013 in Victoria Square.  It now flies permanently alongside the Australian flag on one of the two tall flagpoles in the centre of the square.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2002, the Adelaide City Council formally recognised the areas heritage by bestowing the dual name Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga. The old tram depot at the Square was also demolished, so was the old SAPOL Headquarters. An SA Water office building was built in its place. In 2012 the Adelaide City Council endorsed $24 million in funding to begin rejuvenating Victoria Square. Construction commenced in March 2013 and the first of two planned stages (the northern half) was completed in February 2014. The planned redevelopment of the southern half has been held up due to lack of funding. The full development included:\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Queen Victoria statue ===\nLocated in the centre of the square is a statue honouring Queen Victoria from a model by C. B. Birch, unveiled in 1894. The statue was presented to the city by Sir Edwin Smith, based on a design viewed in England in 1893. It was cast by Moore & Co. of Thames Ditton using bronze specifically made from Wallaroo and Moonta copper. Inscribed simply with \"Victoria R.I.\", the statue was originally unveiled by Lady Smith on 11 August 1894. The statue was symbolically draped in black as a sign of mourning following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. For many years a wreath laying ceremony was held at the foot of the statue each 24 May (or 23rd when the 24th was a Saturday), the anniversary of her birth in 1819. It was removed, cleaned and polished in May 2013 as part of the upgrade of Victoria Square and returned in December 2013 in a modified location.\n\n\n=== Three Rivers Fountain ===\nOriginally located at the northern end of the square in 1968, the Three Rivers Fountain was later relocated to the southern end, and was officially reopened by then Lord Mayor, Stephen Yarwood, in July 2014. The fountain was erected to commemorate the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Adelaide in February 1963. It was first set in operation by the Duke of Edinburgh on 28 May 1968.Sculptured by John Dowie, the centrepiece in the shape of a crown represents the royal visit, and the fountain represents the three rivers that Adelaide draws water from:\nThe Murray (depicted by an Aboriginal man and an ibis)\nThe Torrens (depicted by a woman and a black swan)\nThe Onkaparinga (depicted by a woman and a heron)\n\n\n=== The State Survey Mark ===\nLocated at the northern end of the square, the State Survey Mark commemorates the placing of the first peg for the survey of the City of Adelaide by Colonel Light on 11 January 1837.  This survey mark is the reference point for all other survey marks in South Australia. The mark was unveiled, along with a commemorative plaque by then Minister of Lands, Susan Lenehan on 21 April 1989.\n\n\n=== Reconciliation Plaza ===\nThe east-west road connecting Grote and Wakefield Streets was named Reconciliation Plaza in 2013.  The plaza hosts two flagpoles flying the Australian National Flag and the Aboriginal Flag, which has flown permanently in the square since 2002.  In 1971, the square was the first place the Aboriginal Flag was flown, at a land rights rally. (See Dual naming, above.)Reconciliation Plaza was officially opened on 26 May 2014 by Mayor  Yarwood, Reconciliation Committee Chairperson Yvonne Agius and Journey of Healing SA Chairperson John Browne.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHindmarsh Square/Mukata\nHurtle Square/Tangkaira\nLight Square/Wauwi\nWhitmore Square/Iparrityi\nWilliam Light\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHems, Owen. \"Victoria Square/ Tarntanyangga\".

          "The Victoria Square Fountain has been moved from its original location, not something that I agree with; moving an original landmark goes against my thinking. However Victoria Square offers plenty of space with nice seating and grassed areas. The original fountain is stunning",
          "Now the festivals are over and the grass has returned, serenity comes to the centre of Adelaide. Its easy to grab a good coffee, listen to the fountain and the ducks in residence, ignor the traffic, close you eyes & drift off into another world. Bliss over a lunchtime !",
          "It is an open space in the city centre, plenty of nice street furnitures, meeting place for some, beautiful fountain with sculptures and the statue of Queen Victoria at the centre. Adelaide Trams and Free Busses pass this square. Combine your trip here with other attractions",

          "Great place to visit when an event is on. Great facilities and awesome spot with some shade. Perfect for events as it is in the heart of the city.",
          "The square gets better and better. Have to admit I wasn't sure when it was first redeveloped but I'm loving the space and love the way it gets used for all different events. It really is worth a visit and it's great to have the fountain back!",
          "People just sit and gather here. You can spot this place from the Tram too. Very well kept and maintained.",
          "All buses go through here including the free bus. Worth getting off to have a look of what a city should do with its open space.",
          "It is a very central location, beautiful park to look at both in the day and at night when it is all lit up with string lights with the dancing fountain. A few homeless people around though at night around the bathrooms scaring off some young families.",
          "Great spot for lots of events that happen throughout the year. Located in the middle Adelaide and close to everything",
          "This square really is heart of Adelaide. Usually where most of the major events are held. If you are visit look out for the restaurant to the west called Meatballs & Co. Great place for lunch or siiting under the trees. Great variety of meatballs with great sauces.Great",
          "I couldn't help but think they could do better with this area than a large patch of grass and two huge flags. The square is in the centre of the city, traffic runs around it and the tram runs through it. Unfortunately despite it's large size it doesn't seem to be used for much.",
          "I went into the square on three days during the tour down under to watch the race on the large tv screens. Great place to sit and watch plus there were places to buy food and drinks and stalls selling bikes and accessories and the tour village was setup on the southern end",
          "Vic Square is an ever-changing location in the actual centre of the city square mile. The trams and buses run through it as well as several lanes of traffic. It is orderly however and is a good place from which to go to the cafes down Gouger Street and the wonderful Central",
          "A sound recent revamp by the ACC has produced a great set up for locals and visitors. A heavily used place in the months of January thru to April with Tour Down Under and various key events. A bit more shade however is required and maybe more permanent shade features need to be",

          "As I said the square is a lousy design that is further compounded by terrible pavers and the design is not user friendly",
          "Place with no much care for the pedestrian tourists. No much trees and not confortable benchs to seat.",
          "Victoria Square/Tarntanyangga has always held some iconic memories for me. From the pie cart at the GPO, to the beautiful fountain we played as kids. The latest renovation sees the sterilisation of a beautiful park area, removal of trees, and is frequently bordered off from",
          "Spent Millions achieved little. The square has not really improved. Maybe the dedicated bus lane is a gain. But overall it is still not a people's square. Maybe it should have eateries in the square. I wonder about the toxicity of the Cycads fruit?",
          "The new design is great however victoria square always comes to life the most when fork in the road is visiting! Adelaides best food trucks unite for a festival. Food trucks are Adelaides greatest asset and don't miss a fork at Victoria square!",

          "This square is the true centre of Adelaide..Home to many major events but a starting point for those who want to wonder around Adelaide and see the sights. Catch the tram which stops in the middle and either go north to the retail and cultural sights of Adelaide or south and",
          "I love the revamp of the square and it seems to always be having new things added. I must admit to being dubious about it but I think it's been done really well and it is lovely and open. Love the replaced fountain too. Needs more shade but that will come as the trees grow.",
          "It was nice to show my visitors after it has been upgraded. It\u2019s in the centre of the city and surrounded by busy traffic. There are several statutes in the Square; Queen Victoria in the centre and others around the square. There is nothing much to see in the square itself",
          "Not sure if I love it or hate it really. The area is used for a wide variety of events throughout the year, including the Tour Down Under and The Adelaide Fringe, so will often be fenced around pop-up buildings and tents. Not always pleasing on the eye. Close to the brilliant",
          "It's not a Square at all - more an oval shape, but it's still a great example of what a 'Central City Square' should look like! It's a clean, people-friendly open space with an unobtrusive tram stop smack bang in the middle of it. And it leads to the Central Market, which is the",

          "I feel as though I may have visited at the wrong time. Ugly fencing surrounded much of the area, lawn was bedraggled through to non-existent. In short, the place was an eyesore.",
          "I was very surprised to find that the newly renovated Victoria Square has some long sandpits for kids to play in. They are excellent, as you can sit on the shaded benches as they play. While its next to the tram line, its separated so the kids cant wander on. During the week",

          "I really didn't think I would like the refresh but actually I do. It's great to see the fountain all clean and I love the open space and the water feature. It will be even nice when the trees are bigger and it is less of a summer hot spot.",

        "wiki": "The University of Adelaide (informally Adelaide University) is a public university located in Adelaide, South Australia. Established in 1874, it is the third-oldest university in Australia. The university's main campus is located on North Terrace in the Adelaide city centre, adjacent to the Art Gallery of South Australia, the South Australian Museum and the State Library of South Australia.\nThe university has four campuses, three in South Australia: North Terrace campus in the city, Roseworthy campus at Roseworthy and Waite campus at Urrbrae, and one in Melbourne, Victoria. The university also operates out of other areas such as Thebarton, the National Wine Centre in the Adelaide Park Lands, and in Singapore through the Ngee Ann-Adelaide Education Centre.\nThe University of Adelaide is composed of five faculties, with each containing constituent schools. These include the Faculty of Engineering, Computer, and Mathematical Sciences (ECMS), the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of the Professions, and the Faculty of Sciences. It is a member of the Group of Eight and the Association of Commonwealth Universities. The university is also a member of the Sandstone universities, which mostly consist of colonial-era universities within Australia.\nThe university is associated with five Nobel laureates, constituting one-third of Australia's total Nobel Laureates, and 110 Rhodes scholars. The university has had a considerable impact on the public life of South Australia, having educated many of the state's leading businesspeople, lawyers, medical professionals and politicians. The university has been associated with many notable achievements and discoveries, such as the discovery and development of penicillin, the development of space exploration, sunscreen, the military tank, Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes and X-ray crystallography, and the study of viticulture and oenology.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe University of Adelaide was established on 6 November 1874 after a \u00a320,000 donation by grazier and copper miner Walter Watson Hughes, along with support and donations from Thomas Elder.The first Chancellor was Sir Richard Hanson and the first vice-chancellor was Augustus Short. The first degree offered was the Bachelor of Arts and the university started teaching in March 1876. John Davidson was the first Hughes professor of English literature and mental and moral philosophy.The university has a long history of championing the rights of women in higher education. It was the second university in the English-speaking world (after the University of London, 1878) to admit women on equal terms with men (1881), though women studied alongside men from the commencement of classes in 1876, and were equally eligible for all academic prizes and honours. Its first female graduate was Edith Emily Dornwell, who was also the first person in Australia to receive the degree of Bachelor of Science (BSc., 1885). The university also graduated Australia's first female surgeon Laura Fowler (MB, 1891). Ruby Davy (B. Mus., 1907; D. Mus., 1918) was the first Australian woman to receive a doctorate in music. The university was also the first to elect a woman to a university council in Australia, Helen Mayo (MBBS, 1902), in 1914.The great hall of the university, Bonython Hall, was built in 1936 following a donation from the owner of The Advertiser newspaper, Sir John Langdon Bonython, who left \u00a340,000 for a Great Hall for the University.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nOn 2 July 2010, the university officially implemented its \"Smoke-Free Policy\". This move was the culmination of an anti-smoking agenda headed by Professor Konrad Jamrozik and subsequently, following Jamrozik's death, the Executive Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Professor Justin Beilby. Security have the right to eject people smoking within the university buildings and also fine people smoking in the gardens or walkways. It is the first higher education institution in South Australia to institute a smoke-free policy. The North Terrace campus has been smoke-free since July 2010, it was planned that the Waite and Roseworthy campuses would be smoke-free by 2011, and the university's residential facilities have also been made smoke-free.In June 2018, University of Adelaide and University of South Australia began discussions regarding the possibility of a merger. The proposition was described as the formation of a \"super uni\" by Steven Marshall and Simon Birmingham, but the merger was called off in October 2018.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\n\n=== North Terrace ===\n\nThe main campus of the university is on North Terrace. It is bordered by the Art Gallery of South Australia, the State Library of South Australia, the South Australian Museum and the \"City East\" campus of the University of South Australia. The Adelaide University Medical and Dental Schools were located across Frome Road, behind the old Royal Adelaide Hospital (now Lot Fourteen). The hospital moved to the western end of North Terrace and so have the schools; the Medical School North and South buildings were renamed Helen Mayo North and South from 1 January 2018, in honour of Helen Mayo, a doctor at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and a graduate of the University of Adelaide.The vast majority of students and staff of the university are based at the North Terrace campus, where the majority of courses are taught and schools are based. The central administration of the university and the main library, the Barr Smith Library, are both located on this campus. While many other universities have law and business schools or satellite campuses within the central business district, the University of Adelaide is unique among Australian sandstone universities for having its main presence adjacent to the main business and shopping precinct.\nBonython Hall, (the great hall of the university), the Mitchell Building, the Elder Hall, the Napier building and the Ligertwood building, form the North Terrace street frontage of the campus. Bonython Hall is one of the many historic and heritage listed buildings located at the North Terrace campus. Others include the Mitchell Building, Elder Hall, and the Reading Room of the Barr Smith Library.\nIn 2016, the university commenced work on a $1 billion, 20-year \"Masterplan\" for its three campuses. The masterplan envisages new facilities for all schools, and greatly enhanced campus amenities for students, with a focus on pedestrians and cyclists, providing better, safer pathways through the campus, and eliminating vehicle traffic where possible. At North Terrace, the Schulz building will be repurposed as an on-campus residential college, with accommodation, and recreational facilities including a gym. This major transformation of the university's physical presence across all campuses comes in conjunction with the multimillion-dollar renewal and redevelopment of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) site on North Terrace. In September 2017, the RAH moved to the western end of North Terrace, in the $4 billion South Australian Health and Biomedical Precinct (SAHBP), at which the University of Adelaide also has a physical presence in the form of the Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences Building.In 2019 demolition work had begun on parts of the northern wall of the campus.\n\n\n=== Waite ===\n\nThe Waite campus has a strong focus on agricultural science, plant breeding and biotechnology. The School of Agriculture, Food and Wine is based on the Waite campus and the campus contains components of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. It is adjacent to the Urrbrae Agricultural High School.\nA number of other organisations are co-located in the Waite Research Precinct, including the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) (which is part of Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA), whose headquarters are also at the campus); Australian Grain Technologies; the Australian Wine Research Institute. the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); and the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics (ACPFG).\nIt is situated in Adelaide's south-eastern foothills, in the suburb of Urrbrae on 174 hectares (430 acres). A large amount of the land was donated in 1924 by the pastoralist Peter Waite. A large amount of money was donated by Rosina and John, the widow and son of William Tennant Mortlock. These donations were initially used to establish the Peter Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (first Director A. E. V. Richardson), which later became the Waite campus.\nA Soil Research Centre was founded in 1929 with a donation of \u00a310,000 from Harold Darling of J. Darling and Son, grain merchants.In 2004, Premier Mike Rann opened the multimillion-dollar Plant Genomics Centre at the Waite Campus. Then in 2010 Premier Rann opened The Plant Accelerator, a $30 million research facility \u2013 the largest and most advanced of its kind in the world.Malcolm Oades was the director from November 1996 to 2001.\n\n\n=== Roseworthy ===\n\nLocated north of the city, the Roseworthy campus comprises 16 km2 of farmland and is a large centre for agricultural research. It was the first agricultural college in Australia, established in 1883 and the first veterinary school in SA in 2008. Other organisations linked to the campus include SARDI and the Murray TAFE.\nIn 1991, the College merged with the University of Adelaide and became the university's Roseworthy Campus, part of the Faculty of Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences. The merger would see teaching and research in oenology and viticulture transferred to the university's Waite Campus, along with the bulk of its work in plant breeding. Before the degree in oenology was transferred to Waite Campus, Roseworthy produced a number of highly regarded and awarded winemakers and wine critics.From the mid-1990s, the major focus of the campus turned to dryland agriculture, natural resource management and animal production. The campus is also now home to South Australia's first veterinary science training program, which commenced in 2008. The new Veterinary Science Centre houses not only teaching facilities, including a surgical skills suite, but also a public veterinary clinic offering general practice as well as emergency and specialist veterinary services for pet animals.  There are also specialised pathology laboratories in this centre for teaching, research and diagnostic work. In 2013, the veterinary science facilities were expanded with the opening of the Equine Health and Performance Centre, a state-of-the-art facility for equine surgery, sports medicine, internal medicine and reproduction.\n\n\n== Other locations ==\n\n\n=== National Wine Centre ===\n\nLocated in the Adelaide Park Lands at the eastern end of North Terrace, the Wine Centre offers some of the university's oenology courses. Opened in 2001, the facility also hosts public exhibitions about winemaking and its industry in South Australia. It contains an interactive permanent exhibition of winemaking, introducing visitors to the technology, varieties and styles of wine. It also has a wine tasting area, giving visitors the opportunity to taste and compare wines from different areas of Australia.\nThe Wine Centre is situated at the eastern end of North Terrace, Adelaide in the eastern parklands and adjacent to the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The building, designed by Cox Grieve Gillett, uses building materials to reflect items used in making wine.\n\n\n=== Thebarton ===\n\nThebarton is the base of the university's Office of Industry Liaison. The precinct works in conjunction with the University's commercial partners. Commercial enterprises at Thebarton include businesses involved in materials engineering, biotechnology, environmental services, information technology, industrial design, laser/optics technology, health products, engineering services, radar systems, telecommunications and petroleum services. The flames for the Sydney and Athens Olympic Games were developed at the Thebarton campus by the TEC group.\n\n\n=== Ngee Ann (Singapore) ===\nThe Ngee Ann \u2013 Adelaide Education Centre (NAAEC) was the University of Adelaide's first overseas centre. It was a joint venture with the Ngee Ann Kongsi foundation, started in 1998. In 2016, the University of Adelaide withdrew from the partnership, after about 3000 students had graduated over the 18 years of operation.In 2018 the Singapore institution was rebranded as the Ngee Ann Academy, and in 2019 partnered with the University of Adelaide as well as three British universities.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Organisation and governance ==\n\nThe university is divided into five faculties, with various constituent schools:\n\nFaculty of Engineering, Computer & Mathematical Sciences: Australian School of Petroleum; School of Chemical Engineering; School of Civil, Environmental & Mining Engineering; School of Computer Science; School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering; School of Mathematical Sciences; and, School of Mechanical Engineering.\nFaculty of Health and Medical Sciences: University of Adelaide School of Dentistry; School of Medicine, School of Nursing, School of Public Health, School of Psychology\nFaculty of Arts: Elder Conservatorium of Music; School of Humanities; School of Education; and, School of Social Sciences\nFaculty of the Professions: School of Architecture, and Built Environment; Adelaide Business School; School of Economics;  and, Adelaide Law School.\nFaculty of Sciences: School of Agriculture, Food, and Wine; School of Physical Sciences; School of Biological Sciences; School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences.The university has a long history of indigenous education, and established its first formal courses in the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music (CASM) in 1972. The recruitment, administration and support of indigenous students, as well as overseeing the Indigenous Employment Strategy and delivering Foundation Studies Programs, is conducted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education: Wirltu Yarlu in the Division of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Vice-President (Academic).The university currently enrolls in excess of 27,300 students, including over 7,400 international students (2015) from more than 100 countries. Adelaide University has approximately 130,000 Alumni worldwide, along with 400 student exchange agreements.\n\n\n=== Residential colleges ===\nThe University of Adelaide, unlike most universities, did not set any land aside on its North Terrace campus for student accommodation, due mainly to an ideological opposition to the culture of live-in students, but also influenced by the small size of the original campus. However, demand for residential college accommodation led to the establishment of private colleges affiliated to the university. St. Mark's College was founded by the Anglican Church (then called the Church of England) in 1925, Aquinas College in 1950 by the Catholic Church, Lincoln College in 1952 by the Methodist Church, and later St Ann's College, Kathleen Lumley College and Australian Lutheran College. All are located within close walking distance of the university, across the River Torrens in North Adelaide. In addition to providing accommodation and meals for local, interstate and international students, each college organises academic support, social activities and sporting opportunities for its members.\n\n\n=== Governance ===\nIn 2018, Peter Rathjen commenced his tenure as Vice Chancellor, taking over from Warren Bebbington. Rathjen is a Rhodes Scholar, a recipient of the R.A. Fisher Prize for genetics and the Morton Prize for biochemistry, and was the founding member of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Biotechnology. He is a world-renowned stem cell researcher, whose work in gene shearing formed the foundations for genetic engineering.\n\n\n== Academic profile ==\n\n\n=== Commercialisation ===\nThe University of Adelaide has capitalised on opportunities to commercialise its research. The university has the highest volume of commercial research agreements of all Australian universities. It engages in extensive contract research and collaborative work in conjunction with local and international companies, as well as federal, state and local governments. This activity is managed by the university's commercial development company, Adelaide Research & Innovation Pty Ltd (ARI).Some examples of recent influences to the university's teaching and research priorities are the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG; previously the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, or DSTO) in Adelaide's northern suburbs to which the university provides many psychology, physics, engineering, and IT graduates; and the growth in South Australia's wine industry, which is supported by the Waite and National Wine Centre campuses producing oenology and agriculture/viticulture graduates.\nIn addition, the university participates in the Auto-ID Labs, a network of seven research universities in the field of networked radio-frequency identification (RFID) and emerging sensing technologies.\nIn August 2019, Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA) and the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) entered a partnership with the university, in which scientists in diverse disciplines will be able to access PIRSA's research farms share their academic knowledge to the agricultural sector. The collaboration is anticipated to help develop SA's expertise in dryland agriculture, by encouraging multi-disciplinary research and help to bring about new export opportunities.\n\n\n=== Lectures ===\nThe university hosts a number of lecture series, including the Joseph Fisher Lecture in Commerce, established in 1903 following a donation by politician and newspaper proprietor Joseph Fisher of \u00a31000 to the University \"for the purpose of promoting the study of commerce\". The Gavin David Young Lectures in Philosophy began in 1956, owing their existence to a bequest made by Jessie Frances Raven, in memory of her father, for \"the promotion, advancement, teaching and diffusion of the study of philosophy\u2026\". The university also presents the James Crawford Biennial Lecture Series on International Law, named for James Richard Crawford SC, a graduate of the university who went on to be Dean of Law at the University of Sydney and subsequently Whewell Professor of International Law at the University of Cambridge. Crawford delivered the first lecture in 2004. The university is one of a number of institutions to have established an Edward Said Memorial Lecture. The first in this series was given in 2005.\n\n\n=== Research ===\n\nThe University of Adelaide is one of the most research-intensive universities in Australia, securing over $180 million in research funding annually. Its researchers are active in both basic and commercially oriented research across a broad range of fields including agriculture, psychology, health sciences, and engineering.Research strengths include engineering, mathematics, science, medical and health sciences, agricultural sciences, artificial intelligence, and the arts.The university is a member of Academic Consortium 21, an association of 20 research intensive universities, mainly in Oceania, though with members from the US and Europe. The university held the Presidency of AC 21 for the period 2011\u20132013 as host the biennial AC21 International Forum in June 2012.\nThe Centre for Automotive Safety Research (CASR), based at the University of Adelaide, was founded in 1973 as the Road Accident Research Unit and focuses on road safety and injury control.\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\nWhen averaging the world's major rankings, the University of Adelaide (106) appears to be ranked eighth in Australia, behind UWA (136), ANU (103), UNSW (64), Monash University (63), the University of Sydney (56), the University of Queensland (47), and the University of Melbourne (40).The University of Adelaide consistently features in the top 150 international universities as ranked by the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the QS World University Rankings, and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, situating it securely in the top 1% of ranked universities worldwide. The university's Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, and Schools of Physical Sciences, Nursing, and Social Sciences and Humanities, in particular, are reliably ranked in the top 75 of their respective worldwide ranking.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Associations ===\n\nAs of 1 July 2006, membership of the Adelaide University Union (AUU) has been voluntary for all students, following the passing of voluntary student unionism (VSU) legislation by the Federal Government. The AUU funds five affiliates which carry out their functions autonomously. They are the Adelaide Postgraduate Students\u2019 Association (APGSA), the Clubs Association (CA), the Roseworthy Agricultural Campus Student Union Council (RACSUC), the Student Representative Council (preceded by the now defunct Students' Association of the University of Adelaide) and the Waite Institute Students' Association (WISA).\nThe Adelaide University Union was responsible for organising the annual Prosh (University of Adelaide) events.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nThe University of Adelaide has three print news publications; these are:\n\nOn Dit, the student magazine,\nAdelaidean, the University's newspaper,\nLumen, the alumni magazine.The University of Adelaide Press publishes staff scholarship and works of interest about the history and activities of the University. The Press is also responsible for publishing the Adelaide Law Review.\nThe University of Adelaide founded Australia's first community radio station, Radio Adelaide, in 1972.Opportunities to participate in theatre productions are available through the University of Adelaide Theatre Guild and the Law School Revue.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMost university sport is organised by the Adelaide University Sports Association (AUSA). The Sports Association was founded in 1896 by the Adelaide University Boat, Tennis and Lacrosse Clubs. The Association disaffiliated from the Adelaide University Union (AUU) on 1 January 2010 and is currently directly affiliated to the University of Adelaide. The AUSA supports 37 sporting clubs which provide a diverse range of sporting opportunities to students of the University of Adelaide (AU).

          "This centre has the largest collection of vintages in the southern hemisphere. The guided tour is very informative and even gives you a chance to create your own Grape type and wine vintage.. Quite a lot of fun.",
          "As the National Wine Centre is on the edge of the Botanical Gardens we thought we\u2019d go in past for a glass of wine. Out of an amazing selection of wines we chose a Tasmanian Sauvignon Blanc which was so full of flavour. It was a nice place just to sit and enjoy a glass of",
          "Fab visit tour guide Andy was great thank you . Lovely place and very clean great for a venue of any kind wedding corporate dinner and celebrations",
          "Love the way one can pay so little to taste all the different wines. No need to travel to Barossa & wineries afar. Took overseas friend & tasted 12 different wines from various wineries. Saves time & petrol when visitor has limited stay in Adelaide.",
          "This is a fun place for anyone who enjoys wine. After exploring the Botanical Garden, the Wine Centre was a great place to escape the heat and sample some wine. The wine museum has detailed and informative displays on wine making, history, etc. and the cafe offers a self-serve",
          "Nice music with a glass of wine and a charcuterie plate between 4 pm and 7pm on a Friday. Staff were good and we has comfortable seats. Only issue n the day was the invasion by the Wilderness School Formal students - too much giggling and selfies!",
          "Rainy day in Adelaide and visited the Centre. Surprisingly good with informative displays on the technicalities and history of wine making. Great choice of wine to sample and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Free admission.",
          "National Wine Centre offers the opportunity to taste a wide range of top wines from around Australia for a reasonable price at the one location. Lunch was great and the venue is of course world class. It is a very short walk to the city and adjacent to the Botanic gardens.",
          "My friends were given 24 hours notice to find another venue for their wedding when the Cudlee Creek fires took their chosen venue out of the picture. We all started frantically ringing venues. This was made all the more difficult because it was the last weekend before",
          "Interactive exhibits and a lot to take in. Book head to avoid disappointment. The wine cellar an impressive sight and shows off what South Australia has to offer.",
          "The museum with the history of the wine making is housed in a stylish building, though I got the impression that this was very much a secondary aspect of the centre for the tourist. If there is any function on then part of it will not be available. So far as the wine tasting is",
          "Interactive exhibits and a lot to take in...make sure you call ahead maybe to make sure call ahead as if a conference is on some of exhibits are closed off but wine cellar an impressive sight and finish off with a wine tasting showing off what South Australia has to offer",
          "I had'nt been to here before so I checked out what was on offer and am looking forward to returning. We attended a private function for 200 people. The food was superb and the waiting staff helpful and friendly. Highly recommend it",
          "Fantastic building housing so much information about wine. Wines available by the glass in various quantities at a reasonable cost.",
          "Not being a wine drinker wasn't sure about this one. However, as it was at the end of our walk around the Botanic Gardnes decided to wal in. An amazing architectural piece, very different to the main historic buildings of Adelaide central, but so interesting. For the not so wine",
          "A wonderful surprise for my husband's 70th birthday. What a great day.We purchased a voucher on line so it was not expensive. The wine tasting was a little confusing. We were given a card to put in and select the wine we wished to taste. We had no idea how much we had spent on",
          "I attended a group function on Saturday night 9th November in the Gallery room. The salmon entree was delicious but the main course shoulder of lamb came out cold. The lamb was presented in a square of what I describe as mixed pulled lamb with a gristle of fat in the middle with",

          "The first thing to say is that the National Wine Centre is a little bit on the edge of the city centre and I found it hard to get to (though bear in mind all the trams were out of action when I visited). I had quite a walk there and although that is not the Centre's fault, I am",
          "The heart of the wine tasting experience is the wine dispensing system which let you select a taste, a small glass, or a large glass of many different Australian wines and pay with a special card. You can also order food and use the same card. At the end of the evening you pay",
          "This is a great place to experience many of the wines of Australia without going broke buying dozens of bottles. They have this really ingenious wine dispensing system where you put your pre-paid card into a slot where you can dispense a taste, a small glass, or a large glass.",
          "We went for Saturday brunch. We had the Corn and buttermilk crusted chicken and spice crusted salmon. The Evoi Chardonnay was superb.",
          "We purchased a Scoopon that included a platter, free bottle of Botanic Gardens wine and $30 to spend on the tasting experience. Loved every minute of our time here. The staff were great, and knowledgeable. They answered all my crazy questions then let us be when we said we were",

          "Unfortunately the discovery centre was closed due to an event. However we did some wine tasting in the bar and that was perfect. Knowledgable Amir helped us to choose out of 120 wines!",
          "We had high expectations for this place, but left dissapointed. The exhibition was complicated to find. There was no manned reception, but after a search around the place we found it at the back. Then we were done after only 15 minutes, as there was only one room open. We bought",
          "Visiting from Melbourne, we were really keen to try here. The wines aren\u2019t particularly South Australia focused given it\u2019s the national centre, but there\u2019s still lots to choose from. We started with a tap beer and charcuterie plate. First few hiccups were something odd",
          "We enjoyed the wine bar area, you give your cc, they give you a glass and a card. You can choose your pour size of different wines. It would have been nice to have more info posted on each wine, but it was still fun.",
          "Generally a great night and worthy of good support but average food and poor service Maitre D was rude and arrogant",
          "I went here with high expectations of learning infinitely more about the Australian wine industry that I so love. Those hopes were dashed - it a vast space with poorly conceived space and exhibits. You can taste some wine and grab a sandwich of coffee. Instead of celebrating",
          "This is somewhat hidden away, there's a sense of achievement once you find the incredible building tucked away! Good restaurant and interesting exhibits.",
          "Within walking distance of the east end of the city, plan on spending a couple of hours here. There is a self tour of the centre that can be done at your time and pace, and a guided tour offered at specific times. Learn all about the amazing wine regions of South Australia and",

          "This place has a small accessible free museum, but over 120 wine that you can taste in 25, 75 and 150 ml pours. The 75ml is the best deal. You pay per taste which is both size dependent and quality dependent. You can get a great class (150 ml) of Grenache for $9 or pay $30 for",
          "This was great/. After a day of exploring the Botanic Gardens, we stumbled across this gem! A generous amount of tastings later, and some purchases, we will definitely be back. So very enjoyable.",
          "Yep, certainly worth a visit with time to explore. We dined on a light meal with red wine from Langhorne Creek. We sat outside which became cold later but there is ample room indoors in a delightfully sculptured setting. Can't recommend it highly enough. Service including a nod",
          "The building is most impressive &, apparently it's supposed to represent half a wine barrel. We took the free tour with an enthusiastic guide &, as we were only participants, could ask as many questions as we liked. The tour was quite interesting but I didn't think there was",
          "A beautiful building near the Adelaide Botanical gardens houses the National Wine Centre. An upper level contains a display of all the vines grown in Australia. It is fascinating to see the variation in colour and bunch size of the different grapes. On the ground floor there is",
          "Even if you can't afford to eat there it is still worth a visit. Take your overseas guests there, they will be impressed. The unique structure and quality fit out will impress. After your visit you have the beautiful Botanical Gardens to explore.",
          "Using a wine tasting card can be a little dangerous but the benefit is that you can enjoy small tastings of wines you could never normally afford to try. With a few friends you can sample many different wines and then select a larger sized glass or a bottle to drink with food",
          "This place was not at all what I expected, however, I did enjoy my experience. The wine education area is not very comprehensive (if an education in wine making is what you've come to see) but the wine tasting room and the food that was served was great!!! A unique experience",
          "We went there before we got on the Indian Pacific to travel to Perth. Excellent food, excellent wine and all unlimited!",
          "We wandered through on a cloudy Saturday expecting to find exhibits on winemaking, but every space seemed booked by wedding receptions. Lovely building though.",
          "I suppose it would be good if you don't have time to visit any of the wine regions, but if you do you can skip this. Big focus on wines from outside South Australia as well.",
          "I had only made small visits to the National Wine Centre prior to the 2019 Adelaide fringe but with the allure of a venue so close to home and parking I couldn't say no. Marcel and Ele did an amazing job and revitalising what in the past has been a cold space. While staff had",
          "After ordering coffee and waiting 20 minutes, I followed up with the staff and the manager Amir. The response was terse from the waitress Sinead. I said its cold. \u201cToo bad\u201d was Sineads response. I asked if it could be reheated. \u201cNo\u201d. I asked for my money back. The manager, Amir",
          "OK so there was a big noisey Chinese buyers event on but apart from sniffing some smells designed to replicate different wines there was v little here for us. The building is v large but that involves a long walk up a ramp. There are lots of wines to taste - at a price - but it",
          "This is a real special find for an oenophile next to the Botanical gardens. You can start with $2 1 ounce fills to from a selection of 125 wines. I worked my way up to the Penfolds Grange 2014 which was outstanding (at $900/bottle). Can't miss this.",
          "We visited for the Adelaide fringe as there were numerous shows in the variety of rooms and spaces at the centre. not only were the shows we have seen so far very good but the facilities are really pleasant and the food we had was delicious. you can go here for wine tasting",
          "This was a rather serendipitous find. Located on the eastern edge of the Botanical Gardens, this modern building is operated by the U of Adelaide. It combines nice information about grape varieties and wine producing areas of Australia with meeting facilities and a",
          "National Wine Centre is a must visit location. I suspect if you are a wine buff this location will already be on your agenda in Adelaide. However I would like to encourage anybody who enjoys even cheapo wine to visit. I was there for a conference dinner and was able to enjoy",
          "Big impressive modern building in a beautiful setting with lots of space and light inside but not many visitors on the Sunday morning we went. We just did the self guided tour this time. The best parts for us were the videos of well known winemakers such as Wolf Blass and the",
          "I came here for a function last week and it was a great spot. It was a very hot day outside and the function room was lovely and chilled! Great open space",
          "Coffee was divine while waiting to check in to Indian Pacific, Staff were very friendly and the surrounds are lovely, the Meal before boarding Indian Pacific was delicious.",
          "Whilst visiting Adelaide we were feeling a little too lazy to drive out to the vineyards and decided to visit the wine centre. So glad we did as the building alone is great. The exhibition fascinating and the tastings are really well set up. We also ate in the restaurant and",
          "Did the self guided tour. Good in theory but is outdated (a lot the exhibitions are still from 2000). Not all items work in the tour which is disappointing. Beautiful venue and the wine bar down stairs is fantastic (if a little $$$)",
          "Great Wine. Great Food. Great Service. That is pretty much all you need to know. If you want to try a wide ranging selection of Australia\u2019s wines (120 selections) in one location and in small (or large) quantities, this is the place. My wife and I went here for dinner as",
          "It\u2019s really about functions that a wine experience. It has a small display/ wine experience area in museum style. Then a tasting area which you pay for and are left to work through the wines. It has a small cafe attached with nice food. The tasting area is a lost opportunity",
          "Loved my 3 hours at the National Wine Centre in the botanical gardens. Great selection of wines available for tasting. And the food served was excellent.",
          "Brilliant place to visit, spacious, informative, attractive decor and of course marvelous wine. The art is amazing and the food as creative.",

          "Nice building and museum - of course it focusses on Oz wines and local wine history, but the various grape varietals depicted (incl pip and grape shapes) are also interesting. On the ground floor there are climate controlled tasting dispensers: for about AU$ 3 to 5 (depending",
          "very educational, took the Computer based test for winemaking (have to improve a lot), had dinner afterwards at the Center",

          "Attended a function in early Nov. Room set up was excellent & good view of podium from all areas. Drinks selection was hard due to variety & quality. The food from start to finish was outstanding. Definitely didn't leave hungry or thirsty.",
          "This place is very different but interesting. Choose the wine you want to try. There are 3 options of tasting sizes, and you pay accordingly. A good way of trying wine before you buy as there is a very big selection. You pay at the end, as it is all calculated on a card which",
          "An outstanding selection of wines all available to purchase as tasters or full glasses. We started off just buying the tasters, but quickly realized it was cheaper to buy each wine as a 75ml pour. Those of you wanting to taste Grange, this is your spot - for a price. The system",

          "One of the nice things about such place is they don't rip tourist off by charging huge entrance unlike Ayers rock. Very well organised, beautifully done. Very informative and lovely place to visit Nice park next to the centre , u can even have meals here",
          "A beautiful facility, attended a conference here. The staff were very attentive, the food was fantastic, and the wine was second to none. The coffee drinks did not disappoint.",
          "We did not arrive in time for a tour but enjoyed walking through and reading all the details. I especially loved the display of the various types of grapes. How in the world do they tell some of them apart?!?! Wine wine and more wine! Amazing",
          "So many different rooms and places to go. Great place for a function. Attentive staff and fantastic food and wine",
          "The building is lovely and sits on a botanical garden you can access from the back patio (highly recommend checking it out). When we arrived there was no staff to be found, so it was a little confusing as to where we should go and if there was any kind of price associated with",
          "We went here with a group and had a fantastic two hours. Amid was jus superb and recommended any wine to meet our various tastes. Thank you for a great evening and some outstanding wines - best wine was a 'Plane Turns Right' a delicious Malbec Petite Verdout. Thanks.",

          "A visiting friend wanted to go to the National Wine Centre. My intitial thoughts were boring!!! This place is fantastic. Such a great concept and great food to go with it. Many wines to choose from. You help your self and pay for what you have had. We be taking all of our",
          "We visited the Wine Centre as part of a photography group one Saturday morning and were not disappointed - photographers\" delight. The management were more than happy to have us invade their premises and we spent a couple of interesting hours exploring the exhibits and enjoying",
          "Arrived too late to see much of the National Wine Centre itself, but had a ball at the NWC Wined Bar and their robotic/self-serve wine tasting facility. Not cheap, but 120 wines to choose from and it was good fun. The staff are first rate too.",
          "Went here for a couple of wines and some snacks. We were only here for an hour and ordered 2 bread, 2 nuts and arancini plus 2 glasses of wine which costed $48. It took ages and they barely acknowledged me. My friends ordered a couple of glasses too. So we spent about $100",
          "Saturday morning breakfast at the wine centre on a fine day is a refreshing experience. We had a table outside overlooking the botanic gardens. The food was interesting and enjoyable, staff were friendly and helpful and there is good parking.",
          "The concept of wine tasting is incredibly convenient for folks new to the new scene, and gives a good view of the Australian wines. It\u2019s especially good for horizontal tasting to analyse the differences of different estates and vineyards in the same area and vintage. They offer",

          "Invited here to attend an event. A great looking venue with fantastically helpful and friendly staff. The food that was provided was plentiful and enjoyable. Obviously all prepared with great care and attention. The wine selection was excellent and served promptly.",
          "Adelaide is associated with wine, so the presence of such a center is logical, as in Bordeaux, Chianti or Rioja. It is interesting to get acquainted with the history of the formation of winemaking from scratch. An interesting device for determining the grape variety, because",
          "This was a great place to see learn more about wine in Australia. A couple of the halls were closed due to a function but that didn\u2019t matter. Then sitting down at the wine bar having an afternoon of sampling wines (paid for) was just a nice finish. The sampling was great in that",

          "Its not the most obvious of places to situate a National Wine centre and I expect that visitor numbers weren\u2019t quite up to original expectations which is why this is now primarily a function hall. However, the original exhibition about wine is still interesting and informative.",
          "Well! Considering it is called the \u2018National\u2019 Wine Centre of Australia, I expected a lot more. The coffee shop served great coffee but the self directed tour was a disappointment. Many of the interactive exhibits were broken. I have found out more about wine by visiting small",
          "Toilets that smell worse than a Paris pissoire; lukewarm coffee; exhibits that don\u2019t work or are broken and big party hogging the wine tasting- this is a big disappointment. For a national wine centre it doesn\u2019t put Australia in a good light.",
          "The National Wine Centre has been on my list for ages it was just that every time I visited Adelaide other things seemed to jump the queue and so it had languished mid-level until my sister and I decided to visit the Botanic Gardens. As the Centre is right next door there was",

          "When you come to a place that houses various wines from the country, what else can you do but do a wine tasting? Well, you get more than that as you can learn more about Australian wines and that's worth a lot. Definitely a must do when you're visiting Adelaide",

          "One of the prime points of focus, for our July trip to Australia, was wine, so it was natural, that we would visit the National Wine Centre of Australia. We set out from our hotel, planning to walk directly to the Centre, but I admit that we got sidetracked just a bit, here and",

          "We visited the wine centre in a bleak day. Inside was warm and the reception from the bar staff was friendly. We weren't interested in the wine, just ordered the cheese plate to share with water. It was a lovely place just to sit and relax. We chose two cheeses and some sliced",

          "Unlike my previous visitors, my friend who came to visit Adelaide recently was more interested in horticulture than wine tasting. She was very keen to see the display of how vines grow in South Australia. It may be because vines are cultivated differently in Japan.",

          "This is the biggest, stupidest waste of money I have ever seen. What on earth was it suppose to do? No information, very little history, just ridiculous smell stations that smell nothing like wine. Australia is pretty bad at industry information centers, but so much effort for",

          "This was a small exhibition but if you are into wine it is a good introduction to the history and some other insightful facts. The wine tasting works very well with a card collected from the counter you choose out of 100 or so wines and you choose the amount you want out of 3",
          "We visited the wine centre on a weekend break and I have to say we thought that we missed something... There was a wedding on so it may have been that some of the exhibits were not available, but there was nothing there. Simply a restaurant/bar and a room with some info about",

          "We came on this Centre while wandering around the Botanical Gardens. There it was, in a corner of the gardens. The building architecture is reminiscent of a wine barrel, and inside, it's all about wines, their history, how they are produced, and the specialties of different wine",
          "A wonderful facility to learn about Australian wines and the industry. You can buy food to pair with the tastings. For tastings one can select the automatic pouring machines for the volume and price of many dozen selections.",
          "Located just next to the Adelaide Botanic Garden. More wine tasting if you wish. However, dont go too early if you want to go for the wine tasting. Call up to find out what time does the wine tasting session starts. Entrance is free to the wine centre but not sure about the wine",
          "This Centre highlights the wines of Australia, and includes a small exhibition hall with interactive activities about wine (including one where you make your own wine, virtually of course) as well as a tasting area where you can have a taste of some of the wines of the country",
          "Awesome architecture and great staff. The whole place is really a bunch of function rooms slanted for weddings. The small cafe wine tasting section requires you to buy a tasting card at the cafe to insert and pay $2.50 for a tiny sip or more if you want more. My criticism here",
          "Impossible. We had a newish Taxi Driver and he was totally confused about entry/exit points. He got us there, credit to him, but we had to wander around before they quickly took our money for an average experience.",

          "The wine centre is always a lovely place to visit. The information and displays doted around the building is fascinating and informative. If you are having a meal then you will be no doubt surprised by the skills of the chefs. I would recommend this venue for any event large or",

          "Not the easiest place to find, but well worth a visit. A couple of the staff needed to expand their wine knowledge to be working here but you could tell they were keep to learn. The food is well priced, but selection is limited.",
          "This place makes learning about wine so much fun even without the alcohol ever having to step in. Lots of interactive display that helps you learn how wine is made, including a virtual stimulation for your to create your own wine step by step. Wine tasting also available",
          "Conferences rarely feature in the best memories of your life. Blame it on all beige furniture and poorly thought out PowerPoint presentations. Thankfully the National Wine Centre provides vistas, artwork, colour and a wine collection to get you through to the end of the day if",
          "We visited on a Sunday. Walking distance to the centre of Adelaide city. Over 120 wines available for tasting at reasonable price. We tried the 2011 Grange for $36. well worth it. If you haven't got time to travel to the wineries this is the place to go.",

          "I have never been to the national wine centre before. I'm impressed with the structure and the complex. The wine bar is excellent with cheese plates, tapis plates, wine tasting. All very well priced. The coffee is good. You can just wander in and around. What a gem of a place!",
          "Although a small building with an innovative architecture, there is much more to this place. The best experience for me was the learning of the different aromas associated with different wines. If you want to know anything about wine this is the place to go. I would have",
          "This was a fantastic afternoon out - brilliant for wine lovers! First go on a self guided tour, learning about Australia wines. What is grown where, which areas provide which type of wine. Smelling stations allow you to get a concept of different wine aromas, and an online wine",
          "For us, Adelaide was a stop on the Indian Pacific Railway journey fro Sydney to Perth. Wine-tasting is a very technical affair! It involves buying \"credit card\" which then allows to purchase tasters of a huge selection of wines. The meal provided for us well presented and",

          "This is a very modern building with a absolutely huge array of Australian wines on show, well worth a visit",

          "The free self guided tour on wine was interesting enough e.g. theoretically try and make your own wine from various ingredients and have it rated, but you can also try a whole selection of wines by only having to buy small volumes. Leave your credit card behind the desk and away",
          "We held a work function here and the staff and service was great. We gave chocolate and wine packs as gifts. It's a bit out of town but we had a great time",

          "A wedding was taking place when we visited so we some of the exhibitions were not available. However, we were able to visit some of them. The talking to the winemakers was interesting but the technology of that and some of the other exhibits felt quite out of date. I liked",
          "Wines were generally poor, very few decent labels on hand, and of those that were, a number were from other regions (Tasmania, Margaret River, Hunter Valley). Not sure I understand the point at that stage. Very small \"pours\" as well for the price. Just not a good product.",

          "An interesting visit, not too far out the way but still a bit of a walk so would have expected something a lot better. Seems like an average display for a City otherwise boasting to be the founder and the heart of this nations wine production. Please lower your expectations",

          "We did the self guided tour which was entertaining but not as interesting as taking a proper wine tour of course but I don't think it is designed for that kind of thing. It's more for basic information probably suited to school tours. The best part is lunch and the 'debit' style",

          "Went with my tennis buddies. We had tasting plates for our meal so that we could utilise the excellent wine tasting facility. We each had a prepaid card and could try any of the wines on tasting which are under a sealed system so that they do not get oxidised. A great way to try",

          "This was a great place to visit. From the interesting history of wine making in their galleries to the 38,000 bottles in the cellar , you must find time to visit. We bought a specialty wine at a reasonable price and the cafe was also very good. The staff behind the counter know",

          "During a trip to Adelaide, we decided to visit the National Wine Centre in the northern part of the city. We didn't spend a great deal of time there, but there is a facility for tasting various wines. There is a cost for wine tasting. We tried a few wines, and discovered one",
          "The most recent visit to the Wine Centre was on a Sunday afternoon. It reminds me of walking into an arty wine barrel, or is it Noah's Ark, and located slightly out of the way from the main city. On this particular trip the place was very quiet, and apart from the",

        "wiki": "Botanic Park, part of Park 11 (also referred to as Mistletoe Park or Tainmuntilla), is a 34 hectare (84 acre) park in the Northeast Parklands of the South Australian capital of Adelaide. The park is bordered by Hackney Road and Frome Road. The University of South Australia, University of Adelaide, and the old Royal Adelaide Hospital are next to this park. The park also abuts the Adelaide Zoo and River Torrens.  \n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was acquired by the adjacent Adelaide Botanic Garden in 1866, and was formerly used as the venue for the Royal Adelaide Show from 1844 to 1859. On its northern side are an avenue of plane trees planted in 1874. It is also dotted with exotic species such as century-old Moreton Bay figs from Queensland. The park was the venue for the first open-air meeting in Australia of the Salvation Army on 5 September 1880.The park has been compared to Hyde Park in London. With its own Speakers' Corner since the 1890s, Botanic Park is a venue for public debate on a wide range of topics. The Speakers' Corner continues, but with less prominence than in previous times. Today, the park is better known as a site for picnics, wedding-party photographs, and major events such as WOMADelaide, Gardens Alive and Moonlight Cinema.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Migration Museum is a social history museum located in Adelaide, South Australia. It is one of the three museums operated by the History Trust of South Australia. It deals with the immigration and settlement history of South Australia, and maintains both a permanent and a rotating collection of works. Founded as an initiative of the State government in 1983, and with the museum opening in 1986, the Migration Museum in Adelaide is the oldest museum of its kind in Australia. The museum aims to promote cultural diversity and multiculturalism, which they define as including aspects of ethnicity, class, gender, age and region.The site is located on Kintore Avenue between the State Library of South Australia, the South Australian Museum and the University of Adelaide, in a complex of early colonial bluestone buildings set around a courtyard, including  the city's former destitute asylum (from 1850\u20131918). Before this, the site was the location of the \"Native School\", which aimed to educate aboriginal children.The Migration Museum has a full program of activities including education programs for school groups, public events and family friendly fun.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==",

          "This is of great interest to see how different were people, who arrived to Australia year by year. The museum gives you the opportunity to follow",
          "Easy walk from North Terrace, and well worth a visit. Ensure you have a spare hour, as there is lots to read and look at. Combine a visit there with looking at the Adelaide Oval . Five minutes walk apart.",
          "I had no idea this museum existed. Could have spent all day in there ...fascinating personal histories ..MUST GO",
          "We came here by suggestion and were very impressed. It gives the story of the migration of mainly Europeans into the country. There was a particular section on the assisted travel migrants who came from the UK in the 1950\u2019s which I found very moving",
          "Small but full of surprising information. We were surprised about the information we learnt here. For a country that we all we know where it is on an atlas And because most people have a relative here I knew very little about it\u2019s people",
          "As a migrant family we feel part of this place. I grew up in Adelaide and have great memories of my upbringing and past. Our family have invested in the bricks (a kind of mark of respect) which has given us an even greater sense of belonging here.",
          "The Migration Museum was very informative and interesting. It focused on the Migration to South Australia, and contrasted it to the immigration to the rest of Australia. The Museum was smaller than expected, but still fun. It is located just around the corner from the South",
          "Great museum. Not huge or overwhelming. Free. Interesting and insightful. Covers some early history of South Australia; relations between indigenous people and the settlers; white Australia policy; and then the waves of different immigration. Interesting how there was one",
          "Well worth taking a few hours out , to visit and explore what this museum has to offer. Informative, educational, and a must if you wish to understand Australia and her settlement,",
          "The Migration museum is free to enter. There are guided tours at 11 and 3 or you can download their tour app in various on free wifi when you arrive. The tour app is a great idea and gives some interesting information, although we struggled to know which exhibit it was",
          "This is a small but very interesting museum about the immigration into South Australia (who settled and why) but also the impact on the indigenous people of these settlers. Very thought provoking. It is worth an hour or so of your time if you are in Adelaide.",
          "The museum is located in a complex of historical buildings that date to the 1800's. At various stages these served as The Destitute Asylum and an education centre for Aboriginal children. All buildings have been tastefully renovated and the courtyard Settlement Square pavers",
          "There are some interactive displays so a person could learn more about people who migrated to Australia. There is alot of information to learn. There is no charge for this museum. The museum is open 10 to 5 daily. Once you arrive you can take a site map of the museum. Some",
          "An interesting place to learn about how South Australia has been populated from the early Indigenous people to the waves of migrants either displaced from their countries or encouraged to migrate from their countries to SA. Also highlights the attitudes of the country and how it",
          "I had been looking forward to visiting this museum, but was left rather disappointed. Layout is not the best, we were about half way through when we found what I thought was part of the display frame turned out to be pull out screens. Four on each station, but only one could",
          "Has a lot of information on how people came to settle in Australia. Worth a visit to understand Australia's migration flow and confronting if you are no 'white'. It is the museum art gallery precinct and a good short stop.",
          "A small museum on the north side of the cbd. The museum is free. It has some interesting information. The museum is close to the river, botanic gardens and they museums so it easily fits into a day in the city.",
          "Though small, it does contain a lot of details and plenty of highlights in Australia's migration history. Some exhibits are interactive but it's mostly an educational experience more than anything else.",
          "I came to see as I lived in Adelaide as a child, my great grandparents were immigrants after WW2, from UK, Nan moved in 1968, us in 1969 as \u00a310 Poms! we left and Now my daughter is here living, how funny, this is a moving museum which could expand easily and add more interest",
          "The museum is free and covers the migration to Australia from the European colonisation to today. It helped me understand how the Aboriginal people were treated, how absurd the situation could be. And it also helped me understand how relatively recently the views upon people",
          "This was beautifully put together but the style and the lack of multi-media and the darkness of the signs need work, lots of work. Hopefully someone will take it on.",
          "This museum is housed in a lovely old building at the back of North Terrace. We enjoyed wandering around, but there is a desperate need for better lighting, better signage & more interactive exhibits. Most visitors we saw stayed for only a very short time, especially if English",
          "I had a very positive visit. The buildings are picturesque brick and appear well-maintained. The exhibits look fresh and clean - as though the museum is well cared for by the staff. Lots to see, so you could spend 20 min or perhaps 2 hours.",
          "Australia is an immigrant country . This museum pays homage to this heritage. It is very informative and easy to negotiate.Highly recommended",
          "I came across this very interesting museum when exploring between the library and the river. Very interesting displays on the migration to and settlement of SA. Lots of artefacts photos and extracts of diaries etc.",
          "Very well set out and very good interactive displays. we spent well over two hours there; it was sooo informative. we could have easily spent more time there. There was a an excellent photo/poster exhibition about the current world state of migrants and refugees - very well",
          "This is a great place to visit to get the history of migration into Australia; where people have come from and why. It also highlights the negative impacts as well. There\u2019s plenty of information. Definitely worth a visit, and it\u2019s free",
          "We were pleased to see the effort that has gone into presenting the history of the first settlers and th daunting journeys they had to undertake",
          "Check out the original town map and then compare it to Google maps, almost identical over a 100 years later, someone knew how to forward plan. Interesting to see all the different cultures that shaped the Adelaide we see now.",
          "For those who want to know the history of South Australia, it is comprehensively and easily understandable here. It is imperatove to understand the history of a place yoi are visiting to gain perspective on the present. Chronologically arranged and best of all...free.",
          "Interesting display of clothing, goods, letters etc which tell the stories of many migrants to Australia. You need to read the information displayed to get the most out of it. You could spend quite a lot of time here if this is a subject you are interested in. Free entry, and",
          "This museum tells an interesting history about migration to Australia. It is similar to the museum in Melbourne, but this one is free",
          "This little museum traces the arrival of immigrants and refugees from Europe, Asia, the \"ten pound poms\",the child migrants - all of whom have made a valuable contribution to South Australia.",
          "a serene paracolonial minor edifica shelters a set of narratives that require some time and attention and you will be duly remunerated. no theatricality.",
          "The museum is well presented with very interesting exhibits of the early history of the settlers to the region. We saw everything except for the one outside building (I cannot remember what it was called). We were going to view this building on our way out. As were were",
          "This small museum can easily be visited in 45 minutes and is worth every second of it! It tells the story of migration to Australia and is brutally frank of the dark underside to it - from the attempts to keep Chinese people out to the white Australia policy (and its eventual",
          "Good information on the history of migration within Australia and more specifically Adelaide. It is in quite a small space with lots of information hidden in parts to pull out.",
          "Fascinating journey of various Australian Migrants - including their own indigenous Aborigines. Loved the visual displays, archive film displays and collections of the various migrants that have formed the backbone of Australia and made it their home. Free admission but",
          "Found this such an interesting museum and well put together with all its detailed accounts and facts relating to immigrants. You need to spend quite a bit of time in there to really soak up the history of Australia and its immigrants.",
          "Really interesting study of who came to Australia and when, including considerable insight into immigration policies and preferences.",
          "Such a cool little museum. Very interesting information throughout and it isn\u2019t overwhelming. You can go through the whole thing in less than 2 hours. The staff was very friendly and the images and information was very relevant for us Adelaide newbies. Highly recommend a",
          "This is one of the most informative immigration museums that I have visited. The displays are extremely well done and with so much information it hard to take it all in. Details the immigration history of South Australia. A must see in my opinion.",
          "I took some friends from overseas and we all spent the morning looking at some very interesting history. The price was very reasonable especially for pensioners.",
          "An eye opening place that gives you a lot of information on how migrants lived in Adelaide. Lived here all my life and didn\u2019t know half the stuff. Give yourself time to read all the information plaques and listen to the recordings. Very humbling.",
          "A well curated collection of migration over the years. As a Scot I was drawn to the British experience and found the information really interesting and at times found myself thinking - what if. The museum should be commended for facing up to the policies of the post WW2",
          "Better than the Migration Museum in Melbourne and it is free. We particularly enjoyed the interactive exhibit where you take on the role of the immigration officer who decides who gets into the country.",
          "I found the museum very informative, but it required lots of reading to get the best from the exhibits. Would not recommend this experience for the casual museum visitor",
          "Spent a short time in this museum should have spent longer. Went late in the day but there were so many interesting things to see and find out. Should have gone there earlier.",
          "Loved this tiny museum where the lady on reception gave us such a friendly welcome. I even had a go making an interactive postcard for my granddaughter! Great idea. The information is really accessible and very interesting and had we not already been to two other museums we",
          "I enjoy the colonial history. Its a shame you cant check when you family immigrated to australia from here, you can only check SA early records",
          "We did learn alot about immigration to South Australia from early settlement to the present, the treatment of immigrates especilly when the white Australia pollicy was inacted & the way the aboriginals were treated makes one not happy with what happened, free just a donation.",
          "This museum is adjacent to the Art Gallery and well worth a visit. It's fascinating to look through and experience the diverse cultural background of Australian immigrants, with their trials and tribulations and adjustments to an entirely new life experience for them and their",
          "The exhibition gives a great description of the aboriginal history and the history of immigration, warts and all. Interactive exhibitions allowed us to take photos and email them home. post it notes enabled people to express their views.",
          "This is a great place to learn about those who came to Australia voluntarily. I recommend the audio guide to get the most out of the museum.",

          "Being a migrant/refugee I was intrigued by the ads for this museum. My wife and I spent a few hours looking over the remarkable images and stories of early settlement. The rather poor treatment of Aboriginals allowed us to better understand the contempt that still rightfully",
          "Australia has a number of museums about immigration and while this one was decent, I also thought it was far from the most compelling.",
          "Very nice, concise social history museum presenting the story of immigration to Australia and stages of development of the country . Several rooms with displays grouped by subject. Started with a room presenting the history of an early 1960s Polish family immigrating to",
          "We stopped by here on our way through the CBD. It was very informative and insightful. Most people probably don't think twice about what people went through coming to a new country a hundred years ago.",
          "We spent about an hour here as there is a lot of interesting text and exhibits. Entry is actually free, although a donation is expected. I liked the fact that there were plenty of personal stories in particular. The museum also highlights how poorly the aboriginal people were",
          "A bible from 1706, clothes and furniture from the early German settlers, beautiful glassware and pottery - and maps of Europe before WWI - amazing find!",
          "Really informative (and free) history of Adelaide. Easy to get to. Informative exhibits showing various people groups coming to Adelaide for a new life. Also a good history of the local Aboriginal mob & their sad plight.",

          "This was my 2nd trip to this small but very moving museum, which tells the story of the migration of many different peoples to Australia over the centuries, and the impact on those who were already here. Give at least an hour to go through the permanent exhibit.",
          "My wife and I visited the museum while visiting Adelaide for the day. As recent migrants, this was an essential trip. We identified closely with the many people who\u2019ve trod this path before us.",
          "This museum outlines the emotional turmoil that these immigrants must have felt at the prospect of leaving friends and family behind in the search for a better life. An visit not to be missed.",
          "By sticking to the essentials the curators have put together a small but interesting set of displays of migration to SA and also some wider aspects of migration. Particularly poignant are the plaques on the wall as you go in from various ethnic groups recalling their own,",
          "A raw and honest museum, showing the impact of migrants on the indigenous population, and the environment. How sad that so many Aboriginals were decimated by smallpox among other things, and their dwelling/hunting grounds gone for ever.",
          "We spent an hour at the Migration Museum . Settlement of South Australia is quite different from other states. It was interesting viewing the personal experiences of the families that settled after WWII . Also the settlement of the Croatian families which was so different",
          "The first time I visited the Migration Museum, I was pleasantly surprised how interesting the exhibition was. It is an excellent small museum with free entry, friendly staff (and clean toilets). The history of immigration into Australia is showcased via individual stories,",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed the couple of hours we spent here it was so interesting and informative. Loved it",
          "We have visited this museum many times over the past few years to catch their latest exhibition, the main museum has a nice experience and is well laid out, and then the changing exhibits have proved to be an interesting insight into the history of the people of south Australia,",
          "When we entered the court yard we saw a statue of two people migrating. They were hoping for a better world. The original migration house still exists. It wasn\u2019t easy to take a boat to Australia. There were storms, diseases They also had to leave family and friends, knowing",
          "Though this museum has been well documented, I detected a couple of omissions. My interest was piqued at the entrance to the museum reading several plaques heralding groups representative as migrants to South Australia and the nation. On further reading within the museum, it was",
          "This is an extremely interesting place to learn about the various people who made Adelaide their home! If you are like me, one of those people, you may purchase a paver in the courtyard and have it inscribed. Our paver reflects my mother and I having coming from Wales along with",
          "We didn't know much about australian history so were keen to learn about the aboriginal community. This is a small museum, but still perfectly formed.",
          "We spent quite some time at this museum. The historical content was extremely informative. Well placed in Adelaide",

          "I enjoyed the migration museum. It has a number of well thought out exhibits. The early white settler displays are novel and interesting. The history of aboriginal life in the area is the best I have seen. The museum has just the right amount of content. You can see everything",
          "This is a small museum. It contains some interesting histories of individuals, especially in the section about the asylum for destitutes. I found the way that some of the material was presented a little off-putting.",
          "Compact and informative free entry museum telling the stories of the Australian 'invaders' and how the different colonial powers sought to take over Adelaide and surrounding regions and how the local aboriginal peoples lost out in terms of land and religion. There then follows",
          "My family purchased bricks to celebrate their migration to Australia in 1963 - what a lovely idea to celebrate those migrants from many countries who helped build this country. We didn't have time to go into the Museum, but what we read on the posters looked very interesting.",
          "Great little museum with really good and interesting displays. Well worth a visit, learning experience as well! Recommended.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit that has all the history of immigration to Adelaide. It is a small place but packed with information and so interesting. Once you start to read and look at the displays it is hard to move on quickly. Outstanding place to visit and you need a",
          "Excellent display of the history of all migration to South Australia.The exhibition is rather smaller than I'm used to. However, this served to enhance the content of the display. Recommended for all those with an interest in National History.",

          "We visited this today while on holiday from the UK. It was of particular interest as my birth mother was a \u00a310 Pom. We were greeted by a lovely receptionist who offered us a glass of water as we were feeling the 35 degree heat outside. There was no entrance fee - just a",
          "Great museum not as well known as the others. Has an excellent history of settlement in SA you can check your passage to Adelaide by ship , histories of cultures and nationalities. Wonderful rotating smaller exhibitions on anything from settlers foodstuffs, to photography",
          "A really interesting museum but I thought that bearing in mind most white australians had at some time come from somewhere else (ancestors) I thought it could have been more extensive. surely there has been extensive research into the background of those people who have moved to",
          "Very interesting museum depicting the history of immigration into South Australia. Well laid out exhibits add to the enjoyment of your visit",
          "Australia has such an interesting immigration history. Each city has a unique story worthy of your interest. All of the migration museums we have visited in Australia were well presented and informative. We particularly enjoyed the migration museum in Adelaide.",
          "The building itself is historic and interesting. The museum gives an insight, with treasured heirlooms and official papers, into immigration to Australia through the decades. The exhibits extend from the early 1800's to recent years. A separate building has information of the",
          "Absolutely worth visiting this museum to understand the history of migration to SA, and the history of settlement in Australia. I'd love to see a migration museum in every state. It takes about an hour and is situated around the corner (about 75 metres down the road) from the",
          "Enthusiastic helpful staff, who were keen for visitors to ensure visitors experienced all the museum has to offer. The Destitute Asylum moved me to tears. It was fascinating listening to schoolchildren, who were visiting, discussing the cruelty that inmates had endured. I would",
          "Until you see all the displays in this museum, it's not very obvious how many nationalities have settled successfully in South Australia. It's a real eye opener.",
          "Being American we can intimately relate to the actions leading to the settlement of Southern Australia. Our arrival and subsequent overtaking of the many First People nations was just as shameful. The White European attitude of superiority toward the native cultures in hindsight",
          "The presenters were excellent and had the grade 4 students engaged and laughing. I would recommend this excursion for any school for HASS.",
          "Visited this museum in some cbd downtime. With free entry the price was right. The displays are interesting, as is the building which was once a destitute asylum. Friendly and knowledgeable staff engaged in thought provoking discussion about the contribution that migrants have",

          "Walked across town to the big parks and state building to seek out the Migration Msueum. First impressions : its a compact (and bijou) establishment...housed in historic buildings. The panels and stories told are limited and quite short. I felt like the detail, the",
          "The museum is a short walk from North Terrace. I'd recently been to the Melbourne Migration Museum and was interested in South Australia's approach. The Museum has exhibits of the early immigrants, as also a focus on more recent arrivals, whose stories are displayed. I enjoyed",
          "This is spread over several impressive historic buildings and entry for all is through the main one by donation. These and other buildings are all clustered behind the State Library. There\u2019s also a big open area. Some excellent permanent exhibits relate to migration and",
          "The museum is not very big, 30 mns are enough to visit it. It deals with the migration from the beginning till today with testimonies and artifacts which present the difficulties of settlement but with a positive message of success and hope. Free entry.",
          "A lot of information about people from various parts of the world and why they came to Australia. I would have liked a little more specifically about SOUTH Australia, but it was still quite interesting anyway.",

          "It seems incredible that the last \u00a310.00 Poms came out in the 1970's, but this small museum gives a background of what it was like to arrive in the new country as an immigrant, shows pictures of some of the hostel accommodation, and the things that the new Australians brought",

          "What an outstanding museum: it did not avoid the ugly parts of Australia's history while covering the last three centuries, and giving credit to the generosity and pioneering spirit of the immigrants to this country. In addition, the museum was ingenious in its use of the small",
          "this sort of museum must be particular to Australia's special history and so it's fascinating to learn of voyages so many years ago. Very well presented an amazingly helpful staff",
          "A lovely little museum recording the history of those who emigrated to Australia. At the museum you can read the 'warts and all' experiences of those who traveled half way across the world to settle in a new land to find that things were not as they had been told. Interesting",
          "The museum is situated on a few floors and is well worth a visit. It explores the type of immigrants that have come to the town, how they lived and worked and their experiences - which were not always as glamourous as I imagined.",
          "Spent a couple of hours here looking at the exhibits and looking at the photographs of the people that came to Australia and the accommodation they stayed in until they could find a home of their own. Then looked at the videos of the Aboriginal people and how they were treated",
          "This is a free museum just off the North Terrace. Gave us more information on the early settlers to South Australia and the '\u00a310 Poms' that were very common in this area and you do still hear quite a bit about. Not big so can easily get round in an hour or so, but could stay",

          "Interesting history about the migration flows to South Australia over the last two centuries, seen from many points of view. What makes me ashamed, however, is to read the story (which is no secret) of how this country has, despite its enormous wealth, become so mean spirited,",
          "Eye opening museum. Spent 2 hours here there was so much to take in. Very well done and interesting exhibits. I'd recommend starting in the destitute asylum first. This building also houses an exhibit showing refugees throughout Australia's history and cleverly",

          "This is a very interesting stop in Adelaide. We learned so much about the history of all the peoples who settled in Australia. The exhibits were well done. Unfortunately the museum did not have many visitors....it is worth spending time there.",
          "A very well laid out and thought provoking display. There are recordings of immigrant\u2019s memories of their experiences, not all of them good and some were downright shameful. We learned of the dictation test given by immigration officials to test immigrants literacy, if they did",

          "This is such a well set out museum - full of excellent displays, photographs and some very personal memorabillia",
          "This was a great highlight. Pre European history in Aus is really uneventful and pretty much undocumented. This museum captures the relatively recent history brilliantly and incorporates the sensitive stuff very tastefully and accurately. A very friendly lady on the front desk",
          "Walked in off the street having had no plans to trace the family and within one hour was reading relevant documents provided by very knowledgeable and very amiable staff to whom nothing seemed to be too much trouble. Excellent spacious surroundings and a peaceful, ordered",

          "A great place to visit if you have ancestors who migrated to Australia or are looking for an hour or two to entertain the older children (7-12). Some interesting exhibits reveal less well known history of how women and children lived in the 1800s.",
          "Great to read personal stories of various peoples migrations to the Lucky Country from the very first days of settlement to the present day.",
          "We found this very interesting, but just too much reading to be done. Would have preferred a little more visual or interactive displays. However the Destitute Asylum section of the museum was extremely good.",

          "Usually I am not a person that spends long in a museum, but this was a museum that I enjoyed and found informative. I was there for well over 2 hours! The staff were very helpful and friendly. If I was in Adelaide for longer I would have returned as I did not have time to watch",

          "Brilliant place to take the kids. Yes it is educational but it is also interesting and interactive. Did I mention that it is free ( or gold coin donation). You can whizz through the exhibits or spend hours in there at your leisure. We've been a few times and always find",

          "I went for a school excursion and was bored out of my brains. May be interesting to history buff but i was not engaged. This was a while ago but I think that they did have some childrens activities which were old fashioned games and such. they were ok but overall boring.",

          "for those who love museum, this museum is not that big fancy museum that displays various things that will make you feel amazed. However, considering the size of it, which is small, the display is very good. You get the history, you get the illustration! good things come from",
          "Not a lot to see but the buildings are beautiful. Go round the corner and you will find the old police barracks where the first hanging in Adelaide took place - they are now council offices",
          "This was fabulous. we spent a couple of hours here and could have stayed longer. Interactive displays are excellent. No entry fee, but worth a donation!",

        "wiki": "Adelaide ( (listen) AD-\u0259-layd) is the capital city of the state of South Australia, and the fifth-most populous city of Australia. The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide.\nAdelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its metropolitan area extends 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches 96 km (60 mi) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south.\nNamed in honour of Queen Adelaide, consort to King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia. Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens, in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga (\"place of the red kangaroo\"). Light's design, now listed as national heritage, set out the city centre in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands.\nEarly colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. Until the post-war era, it was Australia's third-largest city. It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the \"City of Churches\" due to its diversity of faiths. Today, Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. Adelaide's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century.\nAs South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevards of North Terrace and King William Street.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before European settlement ===\n\nBefore its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous Kaurna people, one of many Aboriginal nations in South Australia. The city and parklands area was known as Tarntanya, or Tarndanyangga in the Kaurna language. The surrounding area was an open grassy plain with patches of trees and shrub which had been managed by hundreds of generations. Kaurna country encompassed the plains which stretched north and south of Tarntanya as well as the wooded foothills of the Mt Lofty Ranges. The River Torrens was known as the Karrawirra Pari (red gum forest river). About 300 Kaurna populated the Adelaide area, and were referred to by the settlers as the Cowandilla.The Kaurna language was a complex one, reflecting their sophisticated culture and deep environmental knowledge. Within a few decades of European settlement of South Australia, Kaurna culture and language were almost completely destroyed. Extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both, which has included a commitment by local and state governments to rename or include Kaurna names for many local places.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nSouth Australia was officially established as a British Province in England in February 1836. The first Governor \nproclaimed the commencement of colonial government in South Australia on 28 December 1836, near The Old Gum Tree in what is now the suburb of Glenelg North. The event is commemorated in South Australia as Proclamation Day. The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, with his own original, unique, topographically sensitive design.\nClaims of the design being by the architect George Strickland Kingston have been thoroughly debunked. The city was named after Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, queen consort to King William IV at the time.Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress, and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals. Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen. Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working-class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land. As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share the convict settlement history of other Australian cities like Sydney, Brisbane and Hobart.\n\nAs it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. But by mid-1837 the South Australian Register was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now the South Australia Police) in April 1838 under 21-year-old Henry Inman. The first sheriff, Samuel Smart, was wounded during a robbery, and on 2 May 1838 one of the offenders, Michael Magee, became the first person to be hanged in South Australia. William Baker Ashton was appointed governor of the temporary gaol in 1839, and in 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design Adelaide's new gaol. Construction of Adelaide Gaol commenced in 1841.Adelaide's early history was marked by economic uncertainty and questionable leadership. The first governor of South Australia, John Hindmarsh, clashed frequently with others, in particular the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over 405 km2 (156 sq mi) of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from Encounter Bay in the south to Clare in the north.\n\nGeorge Gawler took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the Select Committee on South Australia in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the Adelaide Gaol, police barracks, a hospital, a customs house and a wharf at Port Adelaide. Gawler was recalled and replaced by George Edward Grey in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in Glen Osmond that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.\nTrade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the Murray River was successfully navigated in 1853 by Francis Cadell, an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a self-governing colony in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. Secret ballots were introduced, and a bicameral parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the University of Adelaide was founded in 1874, the South Australian Art Gallery opened in 1881 and the Happy Valley Reservoir opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at Broken Hill provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAdelaide was Australia's third largest city for most of the 20th century. Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Historian F. W. Crowley examined the reports of visitors in the early 20th century, noting that \"many visitors to Adelaide admired the foresighted planning of its founders\", as well as pondering the riches of the young city. Adelaide enjoyed a postwar boom, entering a time of relative prosperity. Its population grew, and it became the third most populous metropolitan area in the country, after Sydney and Melbourne. Its prosperity was short-lived, with the return of droughts and the Great Depression of the 1930s. It later returned to fortune under strong government leadership. Secondary industries helped reduce the state's dependence on primary industries. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the Playford Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of Whyalla.\nThe South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries but neglected cultural facilities which meant South Australia's economy lagged behind. International manufacturers like General Motors Holden and Chrysler made use of these factories around the Adelaide area in suburbs like Elizabeth, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. The Mannum\u2013Adelaide pipeline brought River Murray water to Adelaide in 1955 and an airport opened at West Beach in 1955. Flinders University and the Flinders Medical Centre were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, south of the city. Today, Flinders Medical Centre is one of the largest teaching hospitals in South Australia. In the post-war years around the early 1960s Adelaide was surpassed by Brisbane as Australia's third largest city.The Dunstan Governments of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival', establishing a wide array of social reforms. The city became noted for its progressivism as South Australia became the first Australian state or territory to decriminalise homosexuality between consenting adults in 1975. It also became a centre for the arts, building upon the biennial \"Adelaide Festival of Arts\" that commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the Formula One Australian Grand Prix between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands; it moved to Melbourne in 1996. The State Bank collapsed in 1991 during an economic recession; the effects lasted until 2004, when Standard & Poor's reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating. Since 1999, the Adelaide 500 Supercars race has made use of sections of the former Formula One circuit. Adelaide's tallest building, built in 1988, was originally known as the State Bank Building. In 1991 it was renamed the Santos Building and in 2006 it was renamed Westpac House, and it is currently the 160th tallest building in Australia.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century, a significant increase in the state government's spending on Adelaide's infrastructure occurred. The Rann government invested A$535 million in a major upgrade of the Adelaide Oval to enable Australian Football League to be played in the city centre and more than A$2 billion to build a new Royal Adelaide Hospital on land adjacent to the Adelaide Railway Station. The Glenelg tramline was extended through the city to Hindmarsh down to East Terrace and the suburban railway line extended south to Seaford.Following a period of stagnation in the 1990s and 2000s, Adelaide began several major developments and redevelopments. The Adelaide Convention Centre was redeveloped and expanded at a cost of A$350 million beginning in 2012. Three historic buildings were adapted for modern use: the Torrens Building in Victoria Square as the Adelaide campus for Carnegie Mellon University, University College London, and Torrens University; the Stock Exchange building as the Science Exchange of the Royal Institution Australia; and the Glenside Psychiatric Hospital as the Adelaide Studios of the SA Film Corporation. The government also invested more than A$2 billion to build a desalination plant, powered by renewable energy, as an 'insurance policy' against droughts affecting Adelaide's water supply. The Adelaide Festival, Fringe, and Womadelaide became annual events.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAdelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills, and 90 km (56 mi) from Gawler at its northern extent to Sellicks Beach in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia, an Australian government planning initiative, the \"Adelaide Metropolitan Region\" has a total land area of 870 km2 (340 sq mi), while a more expansive definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a \"Greater Adelaide\" statistical area totalling 3,259.8 km2 (1,258.6 sq mi). The city sits at an average elevation of 50 metres (160 ft) above sea level. Mount Lofty, east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of 727 metres (2,385 ft), is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of Burra.\n\nMuch of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation \u2013 sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the Cleland Conservation Park and Belair National Park. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and Onkaparinga catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the Happy Valley Reservoir supplying around 40% and the much larger Mount Bold Reservoir 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.\nAdelaide and its surrounding area is one of the most seismically active regions in Australia. On 1 March 1954 at 3:40 am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date, with the epicentre 12 km from the city centre at Darlington, and a reported magnitude of 5.6. There have been smaller earthquakes in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\n=== Urban layout ===\nAdelaide is a planned city, designed by the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, Colonel William Light. His plan, sometimes referred to as \"Light's Vision\" (also the name of a statue of him on Montefiore Hill), arranged Adelaide in a grid, with five squares in the Adelaide city centre and a ring of parks, known as the Adelaide Parklands, surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there. Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George Kingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates for city plans going back to Ancient Greece, including Italian Renaissance designs and the similar layouts of the American cities Philadelphia and Savannah\u2013which, like Adelaide, follow the same layout of a central city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that surround the city centre.The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable cardinal direction grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of ring roads in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The inner ring route (A21) borders the parklands, and the outer route (A3/A13/A16/A17) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) Grand Junction Road, Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, Portrush Road, Cross Road and South Road.\n\nSuburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and \"country towns\", as well as the satellite city of Elizabeth, have been enveloped by its suburban sprawl. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the South Eastern Freeway to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's South led to the construction of the Southern Expressway.\nNew roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The O-Bahn Busway is an example of a unique solution to Tea Tree Gully's transport woes in the 1980s. The development of the nearby suburb of Golden Grove in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.\n\nIn the 1960s, a Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study Plan was proposed to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, expressways and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier Steele Hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later Labor government elected under Don Dunstan shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the Liberal party won government and premier David Tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.\nIn 2008, the SA Government announced plans for a network of transport-oriented developments across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a 10 hectare industrial site at Bowden for $52.5 million as the first of these developments. The site covers 102,478 square metres, or about 10 hectares, and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the Adelaide to Outer Harbour railway line to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east.\n\n\n==== Housing ====\n\nHistorically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on 1,000-square-metre (1\u20444-acre) blocks. A relative lack of suitable, locally-available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.There is a wide variety in the styles of these houses. Until the 1960s most of the more substantial houses were built of red brick, though many front walls were of ornamental stone. Then cream bricks became fashionable, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular. Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with (painted) corrugated iron or tiles (cement or clay, usually red \"terracotta\"). Since then, Colorbond corrugated steel has dominated. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, most houses were of \"double brick\" construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by \"dwarf walls\". Later houses have mainly been of \"brick veneer\" construction \u2013 structural timber or, more recently, lightweight steel frame on a concrete slab foundation, lined with Gyprock, and with an outer skin of brickwork, to cope with Adelaide's reactive soils, particularly Keswick Clay, black earth and some red-brown earth soils. The use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased. In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the South Australian Housing Trust.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAdelaide has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa). The city has hot, dry summers and mild to cool winters with moderate rainfall. Most precipitation falls in the winter months, leading to the suggestion that the climate be classified as a \"cold monsoon\". Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer, although heavy falls can occur. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80 mm. Frosts are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city with significant wind chill in winter, which makes the temperature seem colder than it actually is. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon, although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at Mount Lofty occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from 8 to 10 \u00b0C (46 to 50 \u00b0F). There are usually several days in summer where the temperature reaches 40.0 \u00b0C (104.0 \u00b0F) or above; the frequency of these temperatures has been increasing in recent years.\nThe average sea temperature ranges from 13.7 \u00b0C (56.7 \u00b0F) in August to 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F) in February.\n\n\n=== Liveability ===\nAdelaide has been consistently listed in the world's top 10 most liveable cities through the 2010s by The Economist Intelligence Unit, although it dropped to tenth place in 2018 after holding fifth position in the previous three years. It was ranked the most liveable city in Australia by the Property Council of Australia, based on surveys of residents\u2019 views of their own city, between 2010 and 2013, dropping to second place in 2014. Greener spaces for sustainable living is an initiative that has proven to create happier residents and is one of the factors that contributes to Adelaide making the top 10 of the world's most liveable cities. For a relatively small city it boasts 29 large public parks as well as a botanical garden in the heart of the city. The reduction of Adelaide's tree canopy cover over recent years due to excessive tree removal for new construction has led to an increase in the cost of housing and a decrease of overall state of well-being.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nAdelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the Government of South Australia. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the City of Adelaide. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the State Government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The State Parliament's Capital City Committee is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.\nReflecting South Australia's status as Australia's most centralised state, Adelaide elects a substantial majority of the South Australian House of Assembly. Of the 47 seats in the chamber, 34 seats (three-quarters of the legislature) are based in Adelaide, and two rural seats include Adelaide suburbs.\n\n\n=== Local governments ===\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between nineteen local government areas. At its centre, the City of Adelaide administers the Adelaide city centre, North Adelaide, and the surrounding Adelaide Parklands. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, James Hurtle Fisher, was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a Lord Mayor, the current being Lord Mayor The Right Honourable Sandy Verschoor.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAdelaide's inhabitants are known as Adelaideans.Compared with Australia's four other major state capitals, Adelaide is growing at a much slower rate. In 2017, it had a metropolitan population (including suburbs) of more than 1,345,777, making it Australia's fifth-largest city. Some 77% of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states.\nMajor areas of population growth in recent years have been in outer suburbs such as Mawson Lakes and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,413 flats, units or apartments.About one sixth (17.1%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.\nAdelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. More than a quarter (27.5%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55 years or older, in comparison to the national average of 25.6%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15-year-olds), who comprised 17.7% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.3%.\n\n\n=== Ancestry and immigration ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:\n\nOverseas-born Adelaideans composed 31.8% of the total population at the 2016 census. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (6.2%), India (2%), China (1.8%), Italy (1.3%) and Vietnam (1.1%).Suburbs including Newton, Payneham and Campbelltown in the east and Torrensville, West Lakes and Fulham to the west, have large Greek and Italian communities. The Italian consulate is located in the eastern suburb of Payneham. Large Vietnamese populations are settled in the north-western suburbs of Woodville, Kilkenny, Pennington, Mansfield Park and Athol Park and also Parafield Gardens and Pooraka in Adelaide's north. Migrants from India and Sri Lanka have settled into inner suburban areas of Adelaide including the inner northern suburbs of Blair Athol, Kilburn and Enfield and the inner southern suburbs of Plympton, Park Holme and Kurralta Park.\n\nSuburbs such as Para Hills, Salisbury, Ingle Farm and Blair Athol in the north and Findon, West Croydon and Seaton and other Western suburbs have sizeable Afghan communities. Chinese migrants favour settling in the eastern and north eastern suburbs including Kensington Gardens, Greenacres, Modbury and Golden Grove. Mawson Lakes has a large international student population, due to its proximity to the University of South Australia campus.1.4% of the population, or 18,403 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nAt the 2016 census, 75.4% of the population spoke English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Italian (2.1%), Standard Mandarin (2.1%), Greek (1.7%) Vietnamese (1.4%), and Cantonese (0.7%).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAdelaide was founded on a vision of religious tolerance that attracted a wide variety of religious practitioners. This led to it being known as The City of Churches. But approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of Australia's least religious cities. Over half of the population of Adelaide identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being Catholic (21.3%), Anglican (12.6%), Uniting Church (7.6%) and Eastern Orthodox (3.5%).The Jewish community of the city dates back to 1840. Eight years later, 58 Jews lived in the city. A synagogue was built in 1871, when 435 Jews lived in the city. Many took part in the city councils, such as Judah Moss Solomon (1852\u201366) and others after him. Three Jews have been elected to the position of city mayor. In 1968, the Jewish population of Adelaide numbered about 1,200; in 2001, according to the Australian census, 979 persons declared themselves to be Jewish by religion. In 2011, over 1,000 Jews were living in the city, operating an orthodox and a reform school, in addition to a virtual Jewish museum.The \"Afghan\" community in Australia first became established in the 1860s when camels and their Pathan, Punjabi, Baluchi and Sindhi handlers began to be used to open up settlement in the continent's arid interior. Until eventually superseded by the advent of the railways and motor vehicles, camels played an invaluable economic and social role in transporting heavy loads of goods to and from isolated settlements and mines. This is acknowledged by the name of The Ghan, the passenger train operating between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin. The Central Adelaide Mosque is regarded as Australia's oldest permanent mosque; an earlier mosque at Marree in northern South Australia, dating from 1861 to 1862 and subsequently abandoned or demolished, has now been rebuilt.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSouth Australia's largest employment sectors are health care and social assistance, surpassing manufacturing in SA as the largest employer since 2006\u201307. In 2009\u201310, manufacturing in SA had average annual employment of 83,700 persons compared with 103,300 for health care and social assistance. Health care and social assistance represented nearly 13% of the state average annual employment. The Adelaide Hills wine region is an iconic and viable economic region for both the state and country in terms of wine production and sale. The 2014 vintage is reported as consisting of 5,836 t (5,744 long tons; 6,433 short tons) red grapes crushed valued at A$8,196,142 and 12,037 t (11,847 long tons; 13,269 short tons) white grapes crushed valued at $14,777,631.The retail trade is the second largest employer in SA (2009\u201310), with 91,900 jobs, and 12 per cent of the state workforce.Manufacturing, defence technology, high-tech electronic systems and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries all play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia were made in Adelaide at the General Motors Holden plant in Elizabeth. The site ceased operating in November 2017.\nThe collapse of the State Bank in 1992 resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4 billion). The collapse meant that successive governments enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which was a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has more recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.The global media conglomerate News Corporation was founded in, and until 2004 incorporated in, Adelaide and it is still considered its 'spiritual' home by Rupert Murdoch. Australia's largest oil company, Santos, prominent South Australian brewery, Coopers, and national retailer Harris Scarfe also call Adelaide their home.\nThe city has been chosen to be the site of the new Australian space center. South Australia is already home to over 80 organisations which employ 800 people in the space sector. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated the \"agency will act as a launching pad to triple Australia's space economy to $12 billion and create up to 20,000 jobs by 2030.\"\n\n\n=== Defence industry ===\n\nAdelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1 billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. The principal government military research institution, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, and other defence technology organisations such as BAE Systems Australia and Lockheed Martin Australia, are north of Salisbury and west of Elizabeth in an area now called \"Edinburgh Parks\", adjacent to RAAF Base Edinburgh.\nOthers, such as Saab Systems and Raytheon, are in or near Technology Park. ASC Pty Ltd, is based in the industrial suburb of Osborne and is also a part of Technology Park. South Australia was charged with constructing Australia's Collins class submarines and more recently the A$6 billion contract to construct the Royal Australian Navy's new air-warfare destroyers.\n\n\n=== Employment statistics ===\nAs of November 2015, Greater Adelaide had an unemployment rate of 7.4% with a youth unemployment rate of 15%.The median weekly individual income for people aged 15 years and over was $447 per week in 2006, compared with $466 nationally. The median family income was $1,137 per week, compared with $1,171 nationally. Adelaide's housing and living costs are substantially lower than that of other Australian cities, with housing being notably cheaper. The median Adelaide house price is half that of Sydney and two-thirds that of Melbourne. The three-month trend unemployment rate to March 2007 was 6.2%. The Northern suburbs' unemployment rate is disproportionately higher than the other regions of Adelaide at 8.3%, while the East and South are lower than the Adelaide average at 4.9% and 5.0% respectively.\n\n\n=== House prices ===\nOver the decade March 2001 \u2013 March 2010, Metropolitan Adelaide median house prices approximately tripled. (approx. 285% \u2013 approx. 11%p.a. compounding)\nIn the five years March 2007 \u2013 March 2012, prices increased by approx. 27% \u2013 approx. 5%p.a. compounding. March 2012 \u2013 March 2017 saw a further increase of 19% \u2013 approx. 3.5%p.a. compounding.In summary:\n\nEach quarter, The Alternative and Direct Investment Securities Association (ADISA) publishes a list of median house sale prices by suburb and Local Government Area. (Previously, this was done by REISA) Due to the small sizes of many of Adelaide's suburbs, the low volumes of sales in these suburbs, and (over time) the huge variations in the numbers of sales in a suburb in a quarter, statistical analysis of \"the most expensive suburb\" is unreliable; the suburbs appearing in the \"top 10 most expensive suburbs this quarter\" list is constantly varying. Quarterly Reports for the last two years can be found on the REISA website.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nEducation forms an increasingly important part of the city's economy, with the South Australian Government and educational institutions attempting to position Adelaide as \"Australia's education hub\" and marketing it as a \"Learning City.\" The number of international students studying in Adelaide has increased rapidly in recent years to 30,726 in 2015, of which 1,824 were secondary school students. In addition to the city's existing institutions, foreign institutions have been attracted to set up campuses to increase its attractiveness as an education hub. Adelaide is the birthplace of three Nobel laureates, more than any other Australian city: physicist William Lawrence Bragg and pathologists Howard Florey and Robin Warren, all of whom completed secondary and tertiary education at St Peter's College and the University of Adelaide.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nAt the level of primary and secondary education, there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of independent and Catholic schools. All schools provide education under the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the International Baccalaureate (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\n\nThere are three public universities local to Adelaide, as well as one private university and three constituent colleges of foreign universities. Flinders University of South Australia, the University of Adelaide, the University of South Australia and Torrens University Australia\u2014part of the Laureate International Universities are based in Adelaide. The University of Adelaide was ranked in the top 150 universities worldwide. Flinders ranked in the top 250 and Uni SA in the top 300. Torrens University Australia is part of an international network of over 70 higher education institutions in more than 30 countries worldwide. The historic Torrens Building in Victoria Square houses Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College Australia, and University College London's School of Energy and Resources (Australia), and constitute the city's international university precinct.The University of Adelaide, with 25,000 students, is Australia's third-oldest university and a member of the leading \"Group of Eight\". It has five campuses throughout the state, including two in the city-centre, and a campus in Singapore. The University of South Australia, with 37,000 students, has two North Terrace campuses, three other campuses in the metropolitan area and campuses at Whyalla and Mount Gambier. Flinders University, with 25,184 domestic and international students, is in the southern suburb of Bedford Park, alongside the Flinders Medical Centre, another campus in neighbouring Tonsley, and maintains a small city campus in Victoria Square. The plaza on the Bedford Park campus was revamped in 2014 and officially re-opened in 2016.There are several South Australian TAFE (Technical and Further Education) campuses in the metropolitan area that provide a range of vocational education and training. The Adelaide College of the Arts, as a school of TAFE SA, provides nationally recognised training in visual and performing arts.\n\n\n=== Research ===\nIn addition to the universities, Adelaide is home to a number of research institutes, including the Royal Institution of Australia, established in 2009 as a counterpart to the two-hundred-year-old Royal Institution of Great Britain. Many of the organisations involved in research tend to be geographically clustered throughout the Adelaide metropolitan area:\n\nThe east end of North Terrace: SA Pathology; Hanson Institute; RAH; National Wine Centre.\nThe west end of North Terrace: South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), located next to the new Royal Adelaide Hospital.\nThe Waite Research Precinct: SARDI Head Office and Plant Research Centre; AWRI; ACPFG; CSIRO research laboratories. SARDI also has establishments at Glenside and West Beach.\nEdinburgh, South Australia: DSTO; BAE Systems (Australia); Lockheed Martin Australia Electronic Systems.\nTechnology Park (Mawson Lakes): BAE Systems; Optus; Raytheon; Topcon; Lockheed Martin Australia Electronic Systems.\nResearch Park at Thebarton: businesses involved in materials engineering, biotechnology, environmental services, information technology, industrial design, laser/optics technology, health products, engineering services, radar systems, telecommunications and petroleum services.\nScience Park (adjacent to Flinders University): Playford Capital.\nThe Basil Hetzel Institute for Translational Health Research in Woodville the research arm of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute, a global research collaboration for evidence-based healthcare with its headquarters in North Adelaide.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cultural life ==\n\nWhile established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the vine cuttings that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the Barossa Valley.\nThe Royal Adelaide Show is an annual agricultural show and state fair, established in 1839 and now a huge event held in the Adelaide Showground annually.\nAdelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers from both major political parties. The renowned Adelaide Festival of Arts was established in 1960 under Thomas Playford, which in the same year spawned an unofficial uncurated series of performances and exhibits which grew into the Adelaide Fringe. Construction of the Adelaide Festival Centre began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the South Australian Film Corporation in 1972 and the State Opera of South Australia in 1976.\nOver time, the Adelaide Festival expanded to include Adelaide Writers' Week and WOMADelaide, and other separate festivals were established, such as the Adelaide Cabaret Festival (2002), the Adelaide Festival of Ideas (1999), the Adelaide Film Festival (2013), FEAST (1999, a queer culture) and Tasting Australia (1997, a food and wine affair). With the Festival, the Fringe, WOMADelaide, Writers' Week and the Adelaide 500 street motor racing event (along with evening music concerts) all happening in early March, the period has become known colloquially as \"Mad March\".\n\nIn 2014, Ghil'ad Zuckermann founded the Adelaide Language Festival.There are many international cultural fairs, most notably the German Sch\u00fctzenfest and Greek Glendi. Adelaide is home to the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, the world's largest Christmas parade.\n\n\n=== North Terrace institutions ===\nAs the state capital, Adelaide is home to a great number of cultural institutions with many along the boulevard of North Terrace. The Art Gallery of South Australia, with around 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection. Adjacent are the South Australian Museum and State Library of South Australia, while the Adelaide Botanic Garden, National Wine Centre and Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute are nearby in the East End of the city. In the back of the State Library lies the Migration Museum, Australia's oldest museum of its kind.\nFurther west, the Lion Arts Centre is home to ACE Open, which showcases contemporary art, Dance Hub SA and other studio and arts industry office spaces. The Mercury Cinema and JamFactory (ceramics and design gallery) are just around the corner.\n\n\n=== Performing arts and music venues ===\n\nThe Adelaide Festival Centre (which includes the Dunstan Playhouse, Festival Theatre and Space Theatre), on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the State Theatre Company of South Australia. Other live music and theatre venues include the Adelaide Entertainment Centre; Adelaide Oval; Memorial Drive Park; Thebarton Theatre; Adelaide Town Hall; Her Majesty's Theatre; Queen's Theatre; Holden Theatres and the Hopgood Theatre.\nThe Lion Arts Factory, within the Lion Arts Centre, hosts contemporary music in a wide range of genres, as does \"The Gov\" in Hindmarsh. The city also has numerous smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars which host performances.\n\n\n=== Live music ===\n\nIn 2015, it was said that there were now more live music venues per capita in Adelaide than any other capital city in the southern hemisphere, Lonely Planet labelled Adelaide \"Australia's live music city\", and the city was recognised as a \"City of Music\" by the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.In addition to its own WOMADelaide, Adelaide attracts several touring music festivals, including Creamfields, Laneway and Groovin'.\nAdelaide has produced musical groups and individuals who have achieved national and international fame. These include the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, the Adelaide Youth Orchestra, rock bands The Angels, Cold Chisel, The Superjesus, Wolf & Cub, roots/blues group The Audreys, internationally acclaimed metal acts I Killed The Prom Queen and Double Dragon, popular Australian hip-hop outfit Hilltop Hoods, pop acts like Sia, Orianthi, Guy Sebastian, and Wes Carr, as well as internationally successful tribute act, The Australian Pink Floyd Show.\nNoted rocker Jimmy Barnes (formerly lead vocalist with Cold Chisel) spent most of his youth in the northern suburb of Elizabeth. Paul Kelly grew up in Adelaide and was head prefect at Rostrevor College. The first Australian Idol winner, Guy Sebastian, hails from the north-eastern suburb of Golden Grove.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\nAdelaide plays host to two of Australia's leading contemporary dance companies. The Australian Dance Theatre and Dance Hub SA (formerly Leigh Warren & Dancers) contribute to state festivals and perform nationally and internationally. Restless Dance Theatre is also based in Adelaide and is nationally recognised for working with disabled and non-disabled dancers to use movement as a means of expression.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nNewspapers in Adelaide are dominated by News Corporation publications\u2014Adelaide being the birthplace of News Corporation itself. The only South Australian daily newspaper is The Advertiser, published by News Corporation six days a week. The same group publishes a Sunday paper, the Sunday Mail.\nThere are eleven suburban community newspapers published weekly, known collectively as the Messenger Newspapers, also published by a subsidiary of News Corporation. The Independent Weekly was a small independent newspaper providing an alternative view, but ceased publishing its print edition in November 2010 and now exists as a digital daily newsletter only, InDaily. The Adelaide Review is a free paper published monthly, and other independent magazine-style papers are published, but are not as widely available.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nAdelaide is served by numerous digital free-to-air television channels:\n\nAll of the five Australian national television networks broadcast both high-definition digital and standard-definition digital television services in Adelaide. They share three transmission towers on the ridge near the summit of Mount Lofty. There are two other transmission sites at 25 Grenfell Street, Adelaide and Elizabeth Downs. The two government-funded stations are run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC South Australia) and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). The Seven Network and Network Ten both own their Adelaide stations (SAS-7 and ADS-10 respectively). Adelaide's NWS-9 is part of the Nine Network. Adelaide also has a community television station, Channel 44.\nAs part of a nationwide phase-out of analogue television in Australia, Adelaide's analogue television service was shut down on 2 April 2013.The Foxtel pay TV service is also available via cable or satellite to the entire metropolitan area.\nAll the major broadcasting networks also operate online on-demand television services, alongside internet-only services such as Stan, Fetch TV, Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and Kayo Sports.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\n\nThere are 20 radio stations that serve the metropolitan area, as well as four stations that serve only parts of the metropolitan area; six commercial stations, six community stations, six national stations and two narrowcast stations.DAB+ digital radio has been broadcasting in metropolitan Adelaide since 20 May 2009, and currently offers a choice of 41 stations all operated by the existing licensed radio broadcasters, which includes high-quality simulcast of all AM and FM stations.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe main sports played professionally in Adelaide are Australian Rules football, association football (soccer), cricket, netball, and basketball. Adelaide is the home of two Australian Football League teams: the Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club, and one A-League soccer team, Adelaide United. A local Australian rules football league, the SANFL, is made up of 10 teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFL) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1927. The SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.\nAdelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events. Until the completion of the 2012\u201314 renovation and upgrade of the Adelaide Oval, most large sporting events took place at either AAMI Stadium (the then home base of the Adelaide Crows, and the then Port Adelaide's home game venue), or the historic Adelaide Oval, home of the Southern Redbacks and the Adelaide Strikers cricket teams. Since completion of the upgrade, home games for Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide now take place at Adelaide Oval.\nSince 1884, Adelaide Oval has also hosted an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of One Day International cricket matches. Memorial Drive Park, adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host Davis Cup and other major tennis events, including the Australian Open and the Adelaide International. Adelaide's professional association football team, Adelaide United, play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is Hindmarsh Stadium, which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few purpose-built soccer stadia in Australia. Prior to United's foundation, Adelaide City and West Adelaide represented the city in the National Soccer League. The two sides, which contest the Adelaide derby against one another, now play in the National Premier Leagues South Australia.\nFor two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level rugby league, after the New South Wales Rugby League had played a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval for five years starting in 1991. The Adelaide Rams were formed and played in the breakaway Super League (SL) competition in 1997 before moving to the new National Rugby League in 1998. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to the more suitable Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a peace deal with the Australian Rugby League to end the Super League war, the club's owners News Limited (who were also owners of the SL) suddenly closed the club only weeks before the start of the 1999 season.\nAdelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the Adelaide 36ers which plays in the National Basketball League (NBL) and the women's team, the Adelaide Lightning which plays in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL). Both teams play their home games at the Titanium Security Arena. Adelaide has a professional netball team, the Adelaide Thunderbirds, which plays in the national netball competition, the Suncorp Super Netball championship, with home games played at Priceline Stadium. The Thunderbirds occasionally play games or finals at the Titanium Security Arena, while international netball matches are usually played at the 10,500 seat Adelaide Entertainment Centre. The Titanium Security Arena has a capacity of 8,000 and is the largest purpose-built basketball stadium in Australia.\n\nSince 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas have hosted the Tour Down Under bicycle race, organised and directed by Adelaide-based Michael Turtur. Turtur won an Olympic gold medal for Australia in the 4000m Team pursuit at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and was the first event outside Europe to be granted UCI ProTour status. Adelaide maintains a franchise in the Australian Baseball League, the Adelaide Bite. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium (until 2016) was Norwood Oval. From 2016 the team moved to the Diamond Sports Stadium located near the Adelaide International Airport due to renovations at Norwood. Its name stems from the local Great Australian Bight, and from the abundance of local Great White Sharks. Adelaide also has an Ice Hockey team, Adelaide Adrenaline in the Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL). It was national champions in 2009 and plays its games at the IceArenA.The Australian Grand Prix for World Championship Formula One racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the Adelaide Street Circuit which was laid out in the city's East End as well as the eastern parklands including the Victoria Park Racecourse. The Grand Prix became a source of pride, and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful Clipsal 500 for V8 Supercar racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a rally of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.\nAdelaide formerly had three horse racing venues. Victoria Park, Cheltenham Park Racecourse, both of which have now closed, and Morphettville Racecourse that remains the home of the South Australian Jockey Club. It also has Globe Derby Park for Harness racing that opened in 1969, and by 1973 had become Adelaide's premier harness racing venue taking over from the Wayville Showgrounds, as well as Greyhound Park for greyhound racing that opened in 1972.\nThe World Solar Challenge race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-years' history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide hosted the 2012 World Bowls Championships at Lockleys Bowling Club, becoming the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.\nDirt track speedway is also popular in Adelaide with three operating speedways. Adelaide Motorsport Park, located adjacent to the Adelaide International Raceway road racing circuit at Virginia (24 km (15 mi) north of the city centre) has been in continuous operation since 1979 after the closure of the popular Rowley Park Speedway. Gillman Speedway located in the semi-industrial suburb of Gillman, has been in operation since 1998 and caters to Motorcycle speedway and Sidecars, while the Sidewinders Speedway located in Wingfield is also a motorcycle speedway dedicated to Under-16 riders and has been in operation since 1978. In 2016 backed my South Australia's Peregrine Group owners of OTR (On the run service stations and 24/7-hour convenient stores) opened up a multi-purpose facility; a state-of-the-art motorsporting park and a hotel alongside its newer OTR service station outside a small township of Tailem Bend currently named The Bend Motorsport Park. Design for thrill seekers and rev-heads the facility currently host South Australia's second V8 Supercars motoring event during a round in August and hopes to bring in other major international motoring events such as SBK Superbikes and other well established FIA motoring events.\nAdelaide is home to the Great Southern Slam, the world's largest roller derby tournament.  The tournament has been held biennially over Australia's Queen's Birthday holiday weekend since 2010.  In 2014 and 2016 the tournament featured 45 teams playing in two divisions.  In 2018 the tournament has expanded to 48 teams competing in three divisions.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBeing centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east\u2013west and north\u2013south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan public transport system managed by and known as the Adelaide Metro. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the O-Bahn Busway, 6 commuter rail lines (diesel and electric), and a small tram network operating between inner suburb Hindmarsh, the city centre, and seaside Glenelg. Tramways were largely dismantled in the 1950s, but saw a revival in the 2010s with upgrades and extensions. A proposal to significantly extend the tram network called AdeLINK is dormant following a change of state government.Road transport in Adelaide has historically been easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Adelaide was known as a \"twenty-minute city\", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, such arterial roads often experience traffic congestion as the city grows.\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:\n\nThe South Eastern Freeway (M1), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to Murray Bridge and Tailem Bend, where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.\nThe Southern Expressway (M2), connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of South Road.\nThe North-South Motorway (M2), is an ongoing major project that will become the major north\u2013south corridor, replacing most of what is now South Road, connecting the Southern Expressway and the Northern Expressway via an motorway with no traffic lights. As of 2020 the motorway's northern half is complete (save for a small link under construction at Croydon Park), connecting the Northern Expressway to Adelaide's inner north-west; the section running through Adelaide's inner west and inner south-west is awaiting funding.\nThe Port River Expressway (A9), connects Port Adelaide and Outer Harbor to Port Wakefield Road at the northern \"entrance\" to the metropolitan area.\nThe Northern Expressway (Max Fatchen Expressway) (M2), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the Gawler Bypass to Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, Adelaide International Airport and Parafield Airport. Adelaide Airport, in Adelaide's south-western suburbs, serves in excess of 8 million passengers annually. Parafield Airport, Adelaide's second airport 18 kilometres (11 miles) north of the city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes. Parafield Airport served as Adelaide's main aerodrome until the opening of the Adelaide Airport in February 1955. Adelaide airport serves many international and domestic destinations including all Australian state capitals.\nAdelaide is also home to a military airport, known as Edinburgh Airport, located in the northern suburbs. It was built in 1955 in a joint initiative with the UK for weapon development.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAdelaide's two largest hospitals are the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) in the city centre, a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Adelaide (800 beds), and the Flinders Medical Centre (580 beds) in Bedford Park, affiliated with Flinders University. The RAH also operates additional campuses for specialist care throughout the suburbs including the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre (150 beds) in Northfield and the Glenside Campus (129 beds) for acute mental health services. Other major public hospitals are the Women's and Children's Hospital (305 beds), in North Adelaide; the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (340 beds) in Woodville; Modbury Hospital (178 beds) in Modbury; and the Lyell McEwin Hospital (198 beds) in Elizabeth. Numerous private hospitals are also located throughout the city, with the largest operators being not-for-profits Adelaide Community Healthcare Alliance (3 hospitals) and Calvary Care (4 hospitals).\nIn 2017, the RAH was relocated from the city's East End to a new AU$2.3 billion facility built over former railyards in the West End. The state-of-the-art hospital forms part of a new biomedical precinct called BioMed City that colocates the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), the University of Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences building, the University of South Australia's Health Innovation Building, and the state's Dental Hospital. SAHMRI is building a $300 million second facility due to be completed by 2022 to house the Australian Bragg Centre with Australia's first proton therapy unit. There are also plans for the Women's and Children's Hospital to be relocated to the precinct adjacent the RAH by 2024.\n\nThe largest provider of community health care within Adelaide is the not-for-profit Royal District Nursing Service (RDNS), which provides out of hospital care and hospital avoidance care.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nAdelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the Adelaide Electric Supply Company, which was nationalised by the Playford government in 1946, becoming the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA). Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the Olsen Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network (ETSA Utilities, later renamed SA Power Networks) and the outright purchase of ETSA Power by the Cheung Kong Holdings for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP Trevor Crothers resigned from the party and voted with the government.The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year. In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation. In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012. South Australia has the highest retail price for electricity in the country.Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Electricity generation comes from a range of technologies and operators. ElectraNet operates the high-voltage electricity transmission network. SA Power Networks distributes electricity to end users. The largest electricity and gas retailing companies are also the largest generating companies.\nThe largest fossil fuel power stations are the Torrens Island Power Station gas-fired plant operated by AGL Energy and the Pelican Point Power Station operated by Engie. South Australia also has wind and solar power and connections to the national grid. Gas is supplied from the Moomba Gas Processing Plant in the Cooper Basin via the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System and the SEAGas pipeline from Victoria.\nIn 2011, South Australia generated 18% of its electricity from wind power, and had 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.Due to almost universal blackouts within the city during September 2016, the state worked with Tesla to produce the world's largest electricity battery at Hornsdale Power Reserve which has increased that state's electrical security to the extent in which large blackouts are no longer an event.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nThe provision of water services is by the government-owned SA Water. Adelaide's water is supplied from its seven reservoirs: Mount Bold, Happy Valley, Myponga, Millbrook, Hope Valley, Little Para and South Para. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements (90GL per annum) in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the River Murray.A sea-water desalination plant capable of supplying 100GL per annum was built during the 2001\u20132009 drought; however, it operated at about 8% of its capacity until 2019. In December 2018, the State and Federal Governments agreed to fund a $2m study to determine how the plant could be used to reduce reliance on river water, in an effort to help save the Murray River basin and mouth (including the Coorong) from further ecological damage.\n\n\n=== Communications ===\nAdelaideFree WiFi is a citywide free WiFi network covering most of the inner city areas of Adelaide, primarily the Adelaide CBD and Northern Adelaide precincts. It was officially launched at the Adelaide Central Markets on Tuesday 25 June 2014. It is provided by Internode, with infrastructure provided by outdoor Cisco WiFi N access points attached to the top of lighting poles, as well as inside cafes and businesses across the city.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAdelaide city centre includes chart of major streets and squares, street widths, and town acres\nAdelaide Hills\nCity of Adelaide\nMusic of Adelaide\nPort AdelaideListsImages of Adelaide\nList of Adelaide obsolete suburb names\nList of Adelaide parks and gardens\nList of Adelaide railway stations\nList of Adelaide suburbs\nList of films shot in Adelaide\nList of people from Adelaide\nList of protected areas in Adelaide\nList of public art in South Australia\nList of public transport routes in Adelaide\nList of South Australian commercial icons\nList of sporting clubs in Adelaide\nList of tallest buildings in Adelaide\nSister cities of the City of Adelaide (the Local government area that governs the city centre)\nTourist attractions in South Australia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAdelaide City Council > Official City Guide\nAdelaide City Council\nKids in Adelaide Retrieved 12 May 2020.",

          "The area has lost a bit of its Chinese charm with a number of non-chinese stores \"invading\" the area. The food court is very Chinese and it you would like authentic Chinese food then this is the palace, great prices also. Would recommend a visit.",
          "We visited China Town with friends. Nice neighbourhood with a lot good restaurants. We went to a Sichuan restaurant serving grilled fish. It is as delicious as the one in China. Also it is the place where Central Market is located, and you can take the tram to the Bay from there",

          "We prefer the older side with authentic dishes that have been the same for years. Highly recommend the Laksa and the Vietnamese place. The newly renovated side also has great food, but seems like they are relying on the fancy decor to sell the place, a nice atmosphere but",
          "nothing there anymore. wasted our time going to see chinatown. very disappointed. Hope it is improves soon!!",
          "It was not as expected so we were a bit disappointed. It is our experience that Chinatowns are colourful, vibrant and full of interesting things to buy. That was not this one. The food market was fine but that was about all. We did not eat there so cannot comment on that.",
          "A lovely way to spend a day with Chinatown and the markets next door. It can get a little crowded but there are plenty of places to sit and have a great tea or coffee. The free city rout bus stops here.",

          "The area is popular with Asians, locals, tourists, students, backpackers and others on a budget. Check out the food court for plenty of fast/tasty and cheap options. Shop for any other Asian related products in the same centre. Its stopless and the cleanest Chinatown in",

          "Chinatown is a famous spot in Adelaide with a variety of Chinese and eastern restaurants. The choice is yours - word of mouth helps locate a decent restaurant. There are specialty shops where you can buy a trinket or two, interesting people, great atmosphere on a Friday night",
          "This is a fascinating part of Adelaide. We reached it via free CBD tram going to Victoria Square from which it is just a short pleasant walk to Chinatown. The Chinatown is rather an Asiatown nowadays. Very interesting, \u201dexotic \u201cstores and markets, outdoor and indoor eateries,",

          "Like most Australan city Chinatowns this one looks like it is getting smaller but when you look at the streets around it there seems to be a spillage of chinese shops and eateries down the alleys across the street from Chinatown; gone are the days with the famous red and green",
          "Quite a small \u201cChinatown\u201d as Chinatowns go. However, on a Sunday night was lively and safe. Plenty of food options. Have a look see if in the area!",
          "Walked through Chinatown while at the Central Market last week. What a busy place! A lot of interesting shops, supermarkets and great food outlets.",
          "No where near as good as other china towns in Australia. Don\u2019t bother. Stick to Sydney or Melbourne.",
          "Chinatown in the Adelaide CBD is located in Moonta Street, a mall between Grote and Gouger Streets. There are plenty of interesting, low cost eateries here including Chinese, Indian, Malaysian, Thai, Afghani cuisines and more. Highly recommended !",
          "Not as interesting as you would think. That said, there are tons of reasonably priced food and tourist tat options.",
          "Chinatown has a great range of restaurants food courts and asian supermarkets as well as the fabulous Central markets. It's always fun.",
          "It has the great restaurants in there not only Chinese but with a real mix of orientals to Italians restaurants and desert and coffee places. Great place to hang out and just within the same area as the Central Market. The Market also offers better choices and prices than",
          "Both entrances are \u201cguarded\u201d by Chinese lions and the area has a good choice of Chinese restaurants, grocery stores and markets selling a variety of products. There are also a number of other restaurants and shops specialising in far eastern food and tastes including India,",

          "So many different restaurants to choose from, Vietnamese , Chinese, Japanese, Italian and so may other nationalities.",
          "This mall is filled with casual restaurants selling yummy dishes. Souvenirs shop selling the usual bad gifts. Supermarkets win me every time.",
          "Very disappointing actually, needs a major face lift and some additional features to capture China Town and its all round history and culture. Most of the eating precinct is tucked away indoors as well. Lacked colour and pizazz",
          "The good - compact and easy to get around - quite a number of dining options nearby including food court - photo opportunity at the gate? The not so good - extremely packed with too many stalls obstructing foot traffic during Chinese New Year festival (poorly planned) - small",
          "Although the Chinatown in Adelaide is small, it is still a good place to visit, the food and shopping is good, and the surrounding area is good to visit too.",
          "While we were walking on Chinatown, we saw lots of stores. They even had a Market Plaza food Court and a supermarket, where everything is cheap. They had jewelries, lotteries, souvenirs and delicious Chinese restaurants. I enjoyed walking in China Tow. I thought I was in",

          "we found this not the best China town we have been too, seems a little old and rundown. some of the shops were just junk. there was a nice bubble tea shop there, but we choose not to eat in the area",
          "We have a thriving Chinese and other Asian cafes and restaurants in Adelaide with a price to suit all! I love the Roast Duck, Shallot pancakes, dumplings and soups found in many spots. Also fun shops, grocery stores with fresh produce and packaged and many gift stalls",

          "I really enjoyed my visit to Chinatown, but because it's so close to Adelaide Central Market it's hard to separate them. Lucky both are great with cool shops and nice restaurants and cafes.",

          "Adelaide's Chinatown is an interesting place to explore with a main street and some little back alleys. These are where to find the interesting stores and inexpensive Mum & Dad restaurants. Worth having a look around.",
          "Actually this was my first time here in Adelaide and I went to the market near by my hotel/apartment on morphett street. The Chinatown was interesting, not like Melbourne where here has got a proper chinatown atmosphere, lots of people and restaurants.",

          "Its of course not a big chinatown given the relative young age of the city, and smaller than that of Sydney, but still worth going as its close to the Central Markets, and there\u2019s a wide selection of not just chinese restaurants, but thai and malaysian too",

          "I have seen many Chinatowns in many cities, so this one is small and not that interesting. It essentially consists of one street called Gouger St, so there is not a lot to see except a number of restaurants and a few grocery stores. However, the food is good here and they serve",
          "It's a busy bustling place, not that big but a place to go and check out . The Resturants all look good. We ate in the food hall where there is plenty to choose from",
          "Lucky to have been here for the Chinese new year, the atmosphere was great, the crowds massive but fun, lots of stalls and restaurants, fairly close to the centre and very friendly area. Food cheaper here then the CBD.",

          "Chinatown is interesting with many stalls and has a good selection of Chinese and other cafes. Close to the centre of Adelaide, it is well worth a visit.",
          "Maybe it is not fair to charge it \"small\" - Adelaide is not big on the whole. Compared to the Chinatowns in Sydney or Melbourne, this Chinatown is a bit shabby.",
          "So many resturants to choose from its hard to know where to eat. Lot of variety with Thai,Chinese,Vietnamese,Japanese & more. We got Chinese from the food court which was nice & plentiful. Lot of people ordering so we figured it must be good. Very busy Chinatown.",
          "located just next to Central Market, the Adelaide Chinatown was not as busy as the one in Sydney or Melbourne. Most of the shops are selling souvenirs or food which were common in most Chinatown.",
          "Interesting area but compared to Melbourne or Sydney a bit short. The market itself is a foodies delight but quite expensive compared to the Vic Market but it stacks up agaist the Sth Melboune market",

          "As we came out of the food court in the Central Market we were right next to the over the street Chinatown sign found in every city with a Chinatown. We wandered for blocks in different directions and checked out a half dozen Oriental Markets and other specialty shops. I",
          "Maybe I'm spoilt coming from Melbourne, where Chinatown is on a much bigger scale, but there really wasn't a great deal to see here. A few of the standard little restaurants and not a great deal else. If you are going to visit Adelaide I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",

          "It'd be easy to miss the arcades to Chinatown. Its a very short street, and has the usual Chinese restaurants, and provision stores. I walked through early morning, and most of the shops were closed. Chinatown is close to the Adelaide Central Markets.",
          "I found Adelaide's China Town to be a little more spread out and open than some of the other ones in Australia. A good range of shops and restaurants, however parking can be a little challenging on the street.",
          "Love the atmosphere, but, parts of the precint need a shake up. Food choice is still excellent. Ying Chow is outstanding.",
          "What a great little place to pop into. Enjoy all the local eats and drinks, a one stop everything shop from giftware, deli, cafe, flower and fruit stalls. A hustle bustle of colour, fun and culture",

          "visit the area each week for eating and sometimes a bit of condiment shopping. It is a fun area and leads into the vibrant Adelaide central market so make a day of it and wander through. Tues, thurs , fridays and saturdays are best as both markets are all open those days. Car",
          "Adelaide's China town reduced to just one street in fact. It does not prevent to play an important role for tourists to feed them cheap and relatively tasty. It is difficult to eat Chinese noodles and stuff every day, but Chinatown will balance Your budget to food. Usually",
          "After having had our lunch in the Asian Food Court, we went to China Town. I warned my friend that it\u2019s a very small China Town on a very short street. Nevertheless, she was glad to see the gates on both sides of the street.",

          "Our long lost and recently found Great Neice took us for a most enjoyable lunch in the food hall which offers a wide variety of Asian cuisines.",
          "Just another Chinatown like the ones in other states in Australia. It has a few Chinese Restaurants along the way if you want to have lunch or dinner. But nothing great.",
          "Seen a lot better in many cities... the best restaurants are not in the main street .... a bit of a let down! Don't bother....",
          "Entire street is filled with good food... i love this place for ice creams.. we often go with kids....",
          "The layout of the Chinatown precinct is a must see. The markets are exciting and colourful. Also the number of restaurants would please any discerning patron. Recommend as an area you must visit.",
          "Adelaides China Town isn't as big as others but it packs a punch. Excellent restaurants to be found here and brilliant cheap eats. Great for groceries and red packets etc.",
          "This is not a large Chinatown compared to some of the others we saw on our trip - but it is quite compact and very busy. The food courts were packed! It is worth a visit if you combine it with the Central Market, just up the street.",
          "thought it would be bigger for some reason, nice to have a walk around and lots of food options available, Chinese new year was nice here shame about the rain",
          "If you like Yum Cha or other asian cuisine, head over to Adelaide,s Chinatown. There are many restaurants to choose from.",
          "Great place to spend some time. Look, smell, hear and eat and get all the vibe of this wonderful place.",
          "A piece of China in Adelaide. Must go for authentic chinese, japanese and other South-east asian cuisines.",
          "China town is worth a look, the food court does look a little old, but the food was good. I recommend the dumpling laska.",
          "When ever we come to town the first place we come to for lunch is China Town it's uncomplicated and the variety sensational, the people friendly and easy undercover parking in the market especially the first hour being free of charge. So when you're in town why not try the food",
          "Fantastic duck,great vibe,awesome BBQ pork,nice part of Adelaide situated right near the Adelaide markets!",
          "Great little area of Adelaide to spend some time, slightly off the beaten track but near some great restaurants, and it has authentic chinese food supplies stores, bakery and even a barber. Helpful to know a little chinese. My haridresser didn't speak a word of English and had",
          "Love this place especially wandering through the supermarket and picking up our favourite goodies. People are so lovely.",
          "I don\u2019t remember chinatown being as happening as it is today. It used to be a single street where you get your fix of dim sum or chinese cuisine but today is pretty filled with not only Chinese cuisine but hipster cafes and bars too. The area surrounds the Central Market area",
          "Lot,s of food places and shops.Has a number of different types of Asian foods. People in Chinatown were very friendly and helpful.",
          "Not very clean. We ate in the food hall and the food was delicious and exceptional value but on the whole it is very average and a let down.",
          "Whilst Chinatown is smaller than some capital cities, it is a vibrant area (particularly after dark)full of specialist shops, restraraunts and people.",
          "Smaller than Chinatown's in other Aus cities of course, but still a great selection of restaurants and a sure-fire place to find dinner in the city.",
          "Always enjoy going to Chinatown to eat . They have wonderful fruit, veg and cheeses. The restaurants are great such a choice. There is a great atmosphere as you walk around.",
          "worth visiting for a variety of cheap eats, dumplings are worth trying at varioous locations and service is simple but quick",
          "The restaurants in Chinatown are abundant and you can find some real bargain price meals, good size servings and tasty as!",
          "Oh and throw in coffee. I reckon Adelaide does coffee better than Melbourne. Chinatown is a bustling area of good restaurants of ALL types and a market and food court. Pay from $5 to $50 a meal your choice. Fresh and fun. We ate there 4 times in a week.",
          "Next to the City Central Markets, it has many food options to explore the tastes of Asia. We bought lunch here several times and took it to Victoria Square to enjoy.",
          "This is a smaller version of what you would find in larger cities than Adelaide. We still enjoyed walking through and seeing the markets and shops. We were however disappointed that there were a smaller number of restaurants than we thought there would be and ended up not eating",
          "A great place to visit, lots of places to dine. Friendly atmosphere. A must to see anytime day or night.",
          "China Town is just a very small area next to Central market If you don't go there you won't miss much. A few tiny Restaurants and Grocery shops. I don't like it.",
          "Worth a look if in Adelaide and you might be after a quick feed or an Asian grocery item. DO NOT expect an area similar to other larger cities, does not compare to San Francisco or even Melbourne's Asian precinct Whilst small it is interesting enough n",
          "We went to Chinatown and were disappointed. Its dirty, dark and dingy. There are not many Chinese restaurants and only a few shops. There is also a curious smell of old deep fryer fat and rotting rubbish. No public area to sit and even walking on the uneven pavers is a disgrace.",
          "I stayed at the oaks which is two blocks from china town. It not only has coles but is full of fresh fruit and veg, meats, cheese, seafood, coffee, nuts, wines, just to name a few. Will worth a visit. I really enjoyed myself.",
          "I was hoping for more unique and quirky chinese/Japanese/korean inspired shops, not just cafes and restaurants on top of one another. The central markets are here too, which you can get lost in, but its really only great if you're here for a long time (or you live in Adelaide)",
          "Walked down Moonta Street and the pavers are all over the place, there isn't enough lighting in the area and it's dirty. Looks a concrete jungle with NO seating and with not much foot traffic and basically very few people walking around. The Council certainly needs to revisit",
          "Went to Adelaide Chinatown for lunch & Asian groceries. Currently being refurbished in the main mall pedestrian area, a bit messy but you still get some good street food from Asian countries in the Food Court. You will be full for under $10.- which is cheap for current standard",
          "I really like this area and I usually make at least one visit here whenever I'm in Adelaide. There are lots of places to eat (not necessarily Chinese) and the central markets are amazing. Best in Australia I reckon.",
          "Excellent chinese food, but nothing else that was really spectacularly chinese - lots of empty shops however, so maybe it was a bad time to go",
          "I think that it was smaller that Chinatown in Melbourne and definitely smaller than Sydney's but still good to wonder around in.",
          "If your looking for somewhere to eat that offers a variety of oriental dishes that are delicious and reasonable in price then this is the place to head for.",
          "We traveled 500 kilometres from the country to visit family and attend a conference. We have always preferred to eat out at a convenient, economical Asian restaurant in the City. Again we struck Gold! Unbeatable... we shall return.",
          "Close to the Adelaide Central Market Adelaide's Chinatown is found. It's orange, green and gold colour scheme is eye catching, Red and orange globes hanging above in the lane between contrast with the bright blue summer sky of Adelaide. There are restaurants offering Chinese",
          "We walked to chinatown from our hotel to grab some dinner, 15minutes later it was a disappointment, only couple of places were opened, and was less 100m from one end to the other. we ended up not eating there and went around the corner to find a place called star of siam, which",
          "Amazing place to visit, to buy a lot of different products, from food to clothes, different groceries of different countries, really cool to visit and learn.",
          "I loved this market the 1st time and loved it again 2nd time around. The food is good and an amazing display on all the stalls, fruit, coffee, cheese you name it is here. Friday night in China town try the food stalls amazing selection to chose from. Definitely not fine dining",
          "Went to browse the Adelaide Central Market and then had lunch in Chinatown. Authentic food at good prices. Very affordable. Even when going later in the evening in the chinese restaurants there.",
          "It is not until the tourists ventures into the heart of Chinatown that the markets are discovered. The fruit and vegs were wonderful. Very busy part of the city.",
          "The dedicated Chinatown section is quite small but it spills out into surrounding streets which has created a great vibe. Unfortunately, a lot of the food options have MSG so you need to be aware of what is in your food.",
          "If you are in Adelaide for a short trip,do visit the Central Market and the nearby Chinatown. Its a small precinct but it boasts many cafes and food shops that offer authentic foods at reasonable prices. There also a few nic nack places that sell lots of fun kitsch",
          "The Chinese districts in Australian cities are great places to sample a variety of foods (mostly Chinese). Walk through early and nosh, then pick out your favorite to return for dinner or tomorrow's breakfast.",
          "This place offers so much, but the food, the food is amazing. Find anything you want to eat at the food court, find amazing pastries along the street, find souvenirs, fresh produce, fresh meats, just about anything you want here.",
          "Having visited Chinatowns all over the world, Adelaide's is one of the smaller versions. Some colour and character, but quite limited really.",
          "It not only provide Chinese disease, it also provide Chinese style gifts and clothing.several Chinese grocery.",
          "Chinatown and the Central Market go hand in hand. The atmosphere is wonderful and a great place to distress. When I was n the workforce I use to go there 2-3 times per week just for the atmosphere.",
          "there is a food hall there old and tired but clean,we ate there almost everyday that we were in town and not on a day tour somewhere the all you can eat chinese shop is the bomb ,tasty hot and many dishes to choose from or hay have a bit of everything I have seen plates piled so",
          "A great array of tasty asian food. Not unlike Chinatowns in any other major city, but well worth a look if you appreciate a good asian meal.",
          "Lots of Asian food. it is easy to get here by tram or bus. We went on public holiday, the food court closed and central market closed as well, we walked around to find public toilet, crossed the road, pass the bus depot then you find it.",
          "Plenty of Asian food at very good price at the food court.. lots of restaurants and Asian grocery shops.",
          "Adelaide's China Town is a must if you go the the Central Market. it has a great variety of food and some pretty original too. Definitely worth a look :)",
          "If you like a good feast of Asian food at a reasonable price, this is a must, so many stalls to choose from. Situated next to the markets, makes it convenient to shop for your fresh produce after",
          "There are a few Chinese restaurants and businesses in the area, but essentially \"Chinatown\" consists of two red gates at each end of a short street. It's no more of Chinese character than much if the surrounding area. If you're in the area, go for a stroll through, but if you",
          "we made it to the mall just in time it was just closing so i did not get to see much but the food was really good loved the chines food the best i ever had",
          "The eating and shopping areas are interesting and very cheap for a large meal or food bargain. The choice of food court vendors is very good.",
          "This Asian inspired setting is home to many Asian restaurants and cafes selling authentic food with delicious local flavours. The only problem there is too much choice as everything looks great. This is popular with the locals and most places were close to full when we visited.",
          "another great places to visit while on holidays do some shopping and some dining or just walk around",
          "If you love Asian food, chinatown is the place .. There are many options ranging from high end restaurants to relatively cheaper food joints. On top of it, the central market is in the vicinity from where you can but fresh vegetables, fruits and bakery items",
          "I went here many times it's fantastic if you like asian food and it's right next to the central market.You can buy food at very cheap prices i went to Chinatown Cafe and had a Prawn Dumpling soup hugh serve just cost $7.50 i was full great value",
          "This area is just metres away from the Adelaide Central Market. Of course it has heaps of Asian grocery stores and Chinese & Asian restaurants. Heaps of colour and movement. worth a visit",
          "Lots of choices for restuarants, the Asian supermarkets located here stock a full range of Asian ingredients",
          "One of the main reasons for choosing Adelaide to spend 3 nights celebrating our honeymoon, was our love for the food that this Chinatown offers. If you love Chinese food, and a big range of it, you will adore Chinatown Adelaide !!",
          "Chinatown is always the place to visit if you are interested in the most diverse foods and produce. Colourful, sensory and many, many options for just about anything you want. I go for the food.",
          "Adelaide's Chinatown is smaller and less interesting than other Chinatowns in Australia, but it's still worth a visit. Cheap food, especially in the excellent food court. Much of the retail is cheap junk, but there are some interesting stores selling Japanese cosmetics and",
          "Nice place to eat Asian food, reasonable price, can walk around and stroll in the market. We used to stay in hotel which was 10minutes walk to Chinatown and mostly had dinner in Chinatown.",
          "Many of the restaurants are a little over-priced and corkage in some places is extreme at $15....so check first if you are going BYO. Some have quite authentic cuisine but we found that there were limited choices at reasonable prices",
          "This place is great to visit, great food in the food court and a range to pick from or there are restaurants... Always great and friendly service and lots to look at in the markets with great and fresh produce!",
          "We visited mainly to do our initial shop for basic food and kitchen items, having just moved to Adelaide. Supermarket was good, Rather disappointing that the food court was closed at about 5:30, thought they would stay open for dinner",
          "I ate here and the choice was vast and the food so much cheaper than a dumpling place in Rundle Mall I had eaten at PLUS the food was superior in my opinion. Also I had a cake and coffee there and it was lovely too.",
          "Lots of oriental restaurants and a great indoor food marked, which is nice on rainy days. However it's nice to be aware of weird south Australian opening hours, if you are in the mood for at late lunch think again as many restaurants are closed between 15-17 o'clock.",
          "A regular venue for a great soup (Vietnamese) in the old food court Choices of the old or new food courts for your eating pleasure Yum Cha / Laksa or usual array of Chinese traditional options",
          "This is a typical Australian chinatown. Nothing good, nothing bad... not he whole I don't think the chinese food in this chinatown is among the world's best... but its ok.",
          "We stayed very close to Chinatown - it was always busy and has a good atmosphere. Lots of wonderful places to eat and is central and easy to find.",
          "Visited Chinatown a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday for lunch. We all enjoyed a variety of dishes. Service is quite fast.",
          "What don't they have, if i lived in Adelaide, this is where i would shop all the time! The fresh fruit, meat, vegies and entertainment! there is nothing they don't have!",
          "We were in Adelaide over Easter and on Easter Monday we were delighted to find that quite a number of food stores were open (not all) and so had an easy lunch there. Because it was Easter it most probably wasn't anywhere near as busy that it might have been on another weekend.",
          "A lot of options to eat chinese food in Adelaide. The only place with opened restaurants on Christmas Day!",
          "It's true that this Chinatown is a small one, so there isn't much to see... you'd do much better in Sydney than you would here. The good thing is that the small list of restaurants here still produce a large amount of food options and near the Adelaide Central Market there is a",
          "So many varieties of tasty fresh food,eat in or take away.. Tables & chairs in abundance. Noisy but enjoyable..",
          "Great food and quirky little shops and right next door to the Central Market. You can't ask for more. Love the Restaurants at night and the food courts during the day for quick meals.",
          "Better than most Australian China towns, bit spread out and more interesting than Brisbane. Take a stroll through one of the Chinese or Asian supermarkets to see how much Asian foods we take for granted. Could entice us to move to Adelaide.",
          "A wide variety of cuisine could be found here such as Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Italian and of course the Chinese restaurants. Several pubs were also located there.",
          "The Chinatown experience is about how they integrate with the local cosmopolitan society in a relatively small city of Adelaide. You cannot compare that with the chinatown in Sydney. Stroll through the market on weekends, you will be surprised to see an exciting vibrant thriving",
          "You can't go wrong when you visit Chinatown in any capital city because you'll know you'll have lots of choice and the atmosphere is always great. This is no different in Adelaide.",
          "If you are attracted by Chinatowns then this is a poor example. There's nothing special about the area - just a number of Chinese food outlets and tacky cheap as chips like stores",
          "The China town has a great atmosphere and food, it comes alive at night with the restaurants and people.",
          "This area is uninspiring with its collection of little shops and cheap imported goods. Typical Chinatown goods found in many cities where there is a collection of such stores.",
          "Good location for a variety of food, but obviously more Asian . Cheap to moderately priced food, eat indoors or alfresco.Handy location adjoining the central market. Top spot and vibrant.",
          "The CBD has a wealth of Asian cuisine at competitive prices. If it's Chinese food you're after, perhaps have a wander down Gouger or Grote Street for some good, cheap eats. Chinatown itself is a little too crowded and isn't really very impressive. Having said that, there is a",
          "As is usual in cities with a Chinatown, Adelaide's precinct is marked by an ornate gate. Obviously this is the place for a plethora of Asian restaurants, so great if you are in the mood for this style of food. Mind you, there are plenty of Asian eateries scattered throughout the",
          "If you're a foodie, you'll want to visit each of the shops in the district to enjoy the wonderful menus - from dumplings to barbecues, noodles and soups.",
          "We walked pass from Central Market to China Town. It was small and not interesting in all aspects. Apart from Chinese restaurants and souvenir shops, there wasn't very much to see. Boring! Do not spend time here.",
          "Had dinner there a couple of times in the evening. Good value food and plenty of choices. We had a Japanese and a Vietnamese meal each, didn't go for Chinese food I know even though it says China Town. My suggestion is to stroll up and down the street and just catch the",
          "In a good location. Easy to get to on the tram. Adequate parking if you have a car. Good choice of restaurants not all Asian close to Adelaide Market",
          "It is small and that is the reason for the rate. You can find many of Chinese food and stores but you can do it very quickly. I wish it was bigger.",
          "Very small area compared with China towns overseas but a must visit as all China Towns are world wide, Part of the Adelaide Central Market complex, parking above. Good food!!",
          "I consider Chinatown to be one of the best areas of Adelaide to go for a Asian meal in Adelaide. Although the focus is on Asian, the range encompasses many styles within the general catagory. Eating houses cover the full gammit also, from no frills to fine dining. If you like",
          "There weren't many restaurants open in between the Chinese gates the evening we went, but it was perhaps a little too early. Found a lovely place to eat very nearby on Gouger st",
          "because was the new year..were lots of celebratons and entertainment, which was very handy and close to where we stayed, lovely and clean and easy to walk to",
          "Small Chinatown compared to other cities, with few authentic shops, but a great food court undercover that offers a huge choice of cuisine at reasonable prices. A good place to visit at lunchtime!",
          "Come and explore this interesting and exciting area with the flavours of Asian foods to temp your taste buds.",
          "Its only small but offers a good choice of asian cafes and restaurants from cheap to expensive and supermarkets to buy all of your ingredients to make your own at home. Next door to the central market so you can buy great fresh produce as well.",
          "Adelaide's China town stretches over two streets and is adjacent to the Adelaide Market. While the area between the two Chinese Gates is small the Asian influence spreads up and down Googer and Grote streets and also down side lanes. Take time to explore! Explodes during Lunar",
          "A street with a Chinese gate at either side does not classify as a town, and if it is only full of fast food eateries, it is even less of a town. Maybe I am a bit harsh but if Adelaide wants a China Town, put a bit of work in. Where is the Chinese culture, I am sure it is more",
          "China town. Just a few street blocks from Rundle Mall. Not as big or as busy as China Town Sydney. A place to eat some Chinese food. A few hours only to see all of it.",
          "This may not be the huge Chinatowns that you find in other cities, but then again Adelaide is hardly a large city. However if you are really looking for some cheap Asian food, or some cheap food in general, then this is definitely a place to check out. The main part of the area",
          "One afternoon in Adelaide & what a great way to spend it. We had already wandered around the markets & this is a fantastic place to visit. We then went to Chinatown. There are so many food outlets to choose from. The whole place was so busy & a big decision had to be made at",
          "There is a food court here known as Food Plaza. There are numerous food stalls but two Chinese stall stood out. One has a signboard something like \"Shanghai Food\". The list price per plate on as much as you can take for $7.50. But to attract customers the boss will quietly",
          "While I didn't arrive here for the purpose of going to Chinatown, to be honest I was somewhat underwhelmed with the number and variety of outlets offered. I think it's great that the precinct is in very close proximity to the Central Markets as I believe this would be the main",
          "With its proximity to the Central Market this is such a great place to go to eat with all variants of Asian food and restaurants and cafes. Terrific food halls and Asian culture. Step off the tram at Victoria Square and walk past the Hilton Hotel and Central Markets! Just love",
          "There are lots of stalls with all sorts of goods being sold, and the food section of it is incredible, wonderful cheeses, vegetables, cakes, meat and fish and it has quite a good food hall if you wish to have a meal there. I love wandering through these markets, because it is",
          "Great place to get to if you are at Adelaide Central Bus Station with some spare time on your hands. Plenty of cheap Asian-style meals at several food courts/restaurants. Lots of shops for just about everything including souvenirs & bags. Plenty of laneways/aisles to explore.",
          "When we went under the paifang (archway) facing Grote Street, we were welcomed by the delicious aroma of Chinese cooking in Moonta Street. As it was the lunchtime on Friday, there were many people dining at the outdoor tables of the Chinese restaurants. There were also grocery",
          "Having never been or seen a China town before Melbournes less than impressive one, Adelaides fitted the bill perfectly. Super Asian market on the corner facing Gouger Street, where you can lose yourself amongst the food, China ware and trinkets. Eating spaces are plentiful and",
          "Chinatown is quite small but has some nice souvenier and jewellery shops and good places to eat. If you are looking for a cheap feed and not too interested in the decor, try one of the Food Halls where there are numerous places to choose from and most are very good eating as",
          "We ended up having dinner in China Town on a Tuesday night recently. Quite a few restaurants weren't open. It was fairly ordinary but worth a look.",
          "I think like most Chinatowns around the world is more or less the same. The car park is very decent price, much better than the one in Rundle Mall. It has your usual selection of Chinese restaurants, supermarkets and other stores. Its walkable distance to University of",
          "I went to Chine Town when I finished seeing the markets, as it was still early everything was closed. What I saw was not worth hanging around to open, I like Sydney & Brisbane Chine Town better.",
          "Since it was a Sunday, the Central Market wasn't open for business but I was able to walk around Chinatown and saw many restaurants open for business with some of them actually crowded. Some of the Chinese restaurants had big tables for 8 to 10 people set up for dining on the",
          "I visited Chinatown in Adelaide after visiting the Central Market located next to each other. There is nothing much to do in Chinatown, just some stores and restaurants. The Food Courts were getting ready to close when I arrived and they were selling their leftover Combo Lunch",
          "Crowded, hot, smelly. I have to put 100 characters in for this review to be submitted.... Won't be going here again.",
          "We enjoyed our mooching around Chinatown. Plenty of variety in meals and we managed to get a bargain. Much cheaper than advertised, think she was happy competing with the other stallholders in the food court. Plenty of souvenirs and other bits & pieces to buy.",
          "Located in town and next door to the Central Markets.Wandered through looking for a sit down lunch.Plenty of choices for dining.Lots of nick nack shops,locals outside shops mulling around.It was New Years Day so a few of the shops were shut.We had lunch at T Chow,packed to the",
          "It was our last stop for some dim sum before departing back home. We arrived and dim sum place wasn't open so we decided to walk around. I was so happy when I found many souvenir shops as I haven't bought anything yet for my friends back home. The prices was very affordable and",
          "The Chinatown in Adelaide is located next to the Central Market and directly opposite to the Central Bus Station (where many visitors and tourists will come here to exchange of tour coaches for their respective day tours in Adelaide). The size of the Chinatown is in fact quite",
          "It is not worth the walk from King William street, it is a very down market area and does not warrant the title china town. There are so many loveley places to visit in Adelaide's CBD but this is not one of them. I would suggest spending more time in the Central Market instead",
          "We had some spare time in Adelaide that morning and decided to visit Chinatown. We've been in several Chinatowns before and had some expectations. But we were a bit disappointed here. Firstly, it's not that big. Then there are a bunch of shops.....but nothing did wow us. There",
          "The China town in Adelaide is not that Chinese in a Chinese's point of view. It is a mix of Asian business, with western elements perfectly blended in. It worth a visit if you would like to just chill out and kill some time.",
          "After a promising entrance at either end there is little of interest in between. Very basic, tired and disappointing!",
          "Certainly not the best Chinatown in Australia. But it is a good place for food with different price options. But all the asian restaurant names are the most hilarious ones I have ever seen. Too funny.",
          "The entrance to Chinatown is quite pleasing, but once in the street there is not a great deal there. Situated right next to the Central Market, parking is not a problem as there is multi story car parks all around. The quality of the food could be better as well, apart from",
          "Been there twice for a lunch. The food is not that good. This place is not big and has nothing much to offer. I love the entrance of this chinatown though.",
          "China Town is always vibrant and buzzing, but the Adelaide centre is now looking tired and cramped. The food is ok, but you have to know where to go for the best value and quality so look around. The buffets are well priced but some times the food looks dry and unpalatable.",
          "Chinatown is not very big, but it's full of asian restaurants and souvenir shops, which are far less expensive than souvenir shops in rundle mall, selling the same things.",
          "the variety of foods on offer are simply mindblowing, Love Yum Cha and all the banquet meals available, plus my partner loves desserts so she was in her element",
          "Never had trouble with car park and everything there under one roof at reasonable prices. Definitely the place to be.",

        "wiki": "Cleland Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia about 22 kilometres (14 mi) south-east of the Adelaide city centre. Cleland Conservation Park conserves a significant area of natural bushland on the Adelaide Hills face and includes the internationally popular Cleland Wildlife Park and the popular tourist destinations of Mount Lofty summit and Waterfall Gully. It is maintained by the South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR).The conservation park was named for Sir John Burton Cleland (1878-1971), a renowned naturalist, microbiologist, mycologist and ornithologist, and member of the Royal Society of South Australia. After a career in medicine and pathology, Cleland became keenly interested in wildlife conservation.The conservation park occupies land in the gazetted suburbs of Cleland, Crafers and Waterfall Gully.The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category II protected area.\n\n\n== Cleland Wildlife Park ==\n\nThe Wildlife Park is accessible by sealed road from both the South Eastern Freeway and Greenhill Road, and on foot on a formed but steep track from Waterfall Gully or Mount Lofty. A limited public bus service operates. A fee is payable to enter the Wildlife Park (but not to the Conservation Park except for car parking at Mt Lofty summit).\nFacilities include a souvenir shop, cafe and toilets. Many visitors pay to be photographed holding koalas. Several other options are available to visitors, including an Aboriginal guide on a Cultural Tour of the Yurridla Aboriginal Trail, which explains dreaming stories of dingoes, emus, koalas, Yurrabilla, the creation ancestor, and a nightwalk, uncovering the secrets of the bush.\nCleland Wildlife Park offers visitors an opportunity to walk through large enclosures and interact with Australian animals such as kangaroos, koalas and emus, and to see others including wombats, Dingo and many bird and reptile species.\nIn November 2017 a concept plan was announced by the Weatherill government to revamp the park, including a hotel and a cable car connection, but the plan was described by critics as \"pre-election glitter\". The Weatherill government was not returned at the subsequent election in March 2018.\n\n\n== Protected Area and Biodiversity Conservation ==\nThere are seven major anthropogenic threats to biodiversity: habitat fragmentation, destruction, degradation (including pollution), overexploitation of species for human consumption, disease increases, introduction of invasive species, and global climate change. These activities such as agricultural expansion, reckless industrialisation and urbanisation, altered the ecosystems and distribution of species. Land use change has led to the degradation, fragmentation and destruction of habitats, therefore triggered the species movement and loss of biodiversity and species extinctions worldwide.There is a need to conserve and restore what humans have changed in the ecosystem on both a large and small scale. According to IUCN, protected areas are areas of land or sea dedicated by law or traditions (governance regimes, scientific, traditional knowledge and community-based approaches) to implementation of protection of biodiversity.IUCN protected area management categories has classified the protected areas according to their management goals and objectives. These classifications are recognised by the United Nations and many national governments. IUCN protected area designations are: Ia) Strict Nature Reserve, Ib) Wilderness Area, II) National Park, III) Natural Monument or Feature, IV) Habitat/Species Management Area, V) Protected Landscape/Seascape, VI) Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources.The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 (NPW Act) in South Australia provides the establishment and administration of reserves for conservation of wildlife in a natural environment, public benefit and pleasure and for other purposes.Cleland Conservation Park has established in 1st of Jan 1945  and classified as Category II  protected area in IUCN protected area management categories. Primary objective for Category II is \"to protect natural biodiversity along with its underlying ecological structure and supporting environmental processes, and to promote education and recreation.\"The current categories and order of the schedules were last reviewed in 2008 and under the NPW Act are:Schedule 7: Endangered species (also including critically endangered and extinct species)\nSchedule 8: Vulnerable species\nSchedule 9: Rare species\n\n\n== Conservation Prioritization and Management Plans ==\nIdentifying priorities for conservation is the first requirement within a protected area. An effective conservation action requires detailed information about the ecosystem, species and their distribution, as well as the distribution of any threat(s) that may affect them. Conservation planners should address three questions: \u201cWhat needs to be protected?\u201d, \u201cWhere should it be protected?\u201d and \u201cHow should it be protected?\u201d All the reserves and parks in South Australia are proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 (NPW Act) and the Wilderness Protection Act 1992 (the WP Act). Conservation of reserves are committed to the Minister under the Crown Land Management Act 2009 (CL Act).A management plan is the utmost important foundation for the direction of managing the reserve. The requirements for the preparation of management plans are outlined in the NPW and WP Acts and need to be prepared soon after the constitution of a reserve. The management plan should identify the vision for the reserve in addition to the strategies and objectives to meet that vision over a 10-year period. Every year, park managers outline the work programs that are aligned with the proposed strategies in the original management plan.Protecting and managing endangered or rare species requires a firm grip of their natural history (their ecology and distinctive characteristics). These essential information are: the species\u2019 morphology, physiology, demography, behaviour, distribution, genetics, environment, biotic interactions as well as interactions with people. The information can be achieved by studying published or unpublished literature and field work. Field work is crucial since only a small percentage of the world's species have been studied. The data in field work is collected by using long term monitoring, surveying, censuses and demographic studies which can determine the historical change of the population size. This enables the managers to distinguish short term fluctuations from the long term decline of population size.Natural Resources Adelaide & Mt Lofty Ranges (AMLR) are following four main strategies to conserve the biodiversity of the region:\nI) Maintain intact (viable) landscapes, II) reverse declines, III) control emerging threats, IV) recover threatened species and ecological communities.\n\n\n== Biodiversity Threatening Processes in Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges (AMLR) ==\nThreatening processes are practices or environmental factors that could threaten the survival or evolutionary development of species, populations, ecosystems and/or ecological communities.There are direct (legal and illegal ) threats impacting biodiversity in AMLR including historical vegetation clearances, the use of biological resources, climate change (causing drought and severe weather), the introduction of exotic species and poisoning practices. There are also threats associated with roads and transportation which cause wild life mortality. These have damaged the habitats, functioning of ecosystems, availability of food and the overall food web. According to Informing Biodiversity Conservation for the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Region, South Australian ecological stresses are:\nHabitat fragmentation\nEdge effects, spatial and temporal provision of resources\nEcosystem conversion, habitat loss and modification\nFragmentation of existing habitat (isolation of populations)\nBarriers to dispersal\nReduced reproduction/ recruitment\nDistance effects (isolation)\nSpecies mortality\nRoad mortality\nSpecies disturbance\nIndirect species effects (e.g. inbreeding, increased competition and loss of pollinator or host)\nEcosystem degradation\nAltered fire regimes\nAltered hydro logical regimes.Fire is an ecological stresses that threat to biodiversity while is a valuable management tool as well.\n\n\n== Native Plants and Animals Biodiversity in Adelaide Mount Lofty Ranges ==\nThe Adelaide Mount Lofty Ranges (AMLR) region is home to a range of native plants and animals.Native Plants\nAround 1,500 species of native plants including orchids, ferns, gum trees, herbs, lilies, grasses and rushes, originate within AMLR. Amongst those, 121 are nationally threatened while seven are considered to be threatened in the region. The two endangered plant species in the region are Fleurieu Peninsula Guinea-flower (Hibbertia tenuis) and Mount Compass oak-bush (Allocasuarina robusta).\nNative Animals\nThere are a great number of different native animals in the AMLR region, however some of these species have already become extinct and many are endangered. These threatened and endangered animals include birds, mammals, reptiles, frogs and freshwater fish. The details are given below.\nBirds\nThe AMLR region comprises 249 species of birds, 69 of which are considered threatened. The three species that are considered Endangered are: the Chestnut-rumped heathwren (Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri), the Mt Lofty Ranges Southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus intermedius) and the Orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster).\nMammals\nThe AMLR region comprises 27 species of native mammals, including an echidna, an antechinus, dunnart species, a bandicoot, possums, wombat, kangaroos, rats and bats. Seven species are considered threatened in a state or national level. The Southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus obesulus) and Western pygmy possum (Cercartetus concinnus) are considered vulnerable, while the Brush-tailed Bettong (Bettongia penicillata penicillata) has been listed as endangered.\nReptiles\nThe AMLR region comprises 68 species of native reptiles, including turtles, lizards, tortoises, geckos, legless lizards, skinks, snakes and goanna species. Six of the species are considered threatened, and the Heath goanna (Varanus rosenbergi) and Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis) are listed as endangered.\nFrogs\nThe AMLR region comprises 7 native frog species. The Brown Toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) is rare in South Australia and considered vulnerable in the region.\nFreshwater fish\nThe AMLR region comprises 20 native freshwater fish, including catfish, galaxiids, lampreys and eels. Three of these species are considered threatened nationally while Climbing Galaxias (Galaxias brevipinnis), Congolli (Pseudaphritis urvillii), Mountain Galaxias (Galaxias olidus) and Pouched Lamprey (Geotria australis) are considered Vulnerable in the region.\n\n\n== Long-term Monitoring of Species and Ecosystem ==\nProtection of species or individual populations is usually achievable via conservation and restoration of habitats. To do so, collecting essential data on biological communities and ecosystem function are important. Therefore, long term monitoring of populations needs to be accompanied by monitoring of the environment parameters. To determine the health of ecosystem, observation of the ecosystem processes such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and soil erosion, is necessary. Monitoring the community characteristics such as the present species and amount of biomass, are also other parameters in a healthy ecosystem. By monitoring the studies of these parameters, it enables managers to decide whether or not the goals of their projects are being achieved or if management plans need to be adjusted.According to Primack (2010), there are \u201clagging\u201d effects on the environment that may not surface for years after the original causes. This \u201clagging\u201d creates a huge challenge towards understanding the changing of ecosystems. Hence, long term monitoring programs provide an early warning for threats to the functioning of ecosystems and communities of species. Examples as mentioned below, can address the conservation/knowledge gaps and help to refine the management priorities:\nChanging in conservation status, an alarm towards becoming extinct\nThe Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis) had been classified extinct until its rediscovery near Burra in South Australia in 1992. It is classified as Endangered in South Australia. Another example Chestnut-rumped heathwren status has changed from Vulnerable in 2008, to Endangered in 2016. Also, Western Pygmy Possum were listed as Vulnerable in AMRL in 2008 and became Critically Endangered in the Adelaide and Mt Lofty Ranges Region in Sep 2015.Different emerging threats and species response\nIn 2008 wildfire was counted as the primary potential threat to Chestnut-rumped heathwren while deliberate burning, residential development (habitat has been cleared/fragmented) and dieback due to Phytophthora, were the secondary threats. However, high threats in 2010 recorded as drought, climate change and roadside accidents (due to inappropriate access and works).The Southern brown bandicoot's (Isoodon obesulus obesulus) decline in 2008 was due to some threats like loss or degradation of woodland habitat (exposed habitats as the result of kangaroos overgrazing), broad scale removal of habitats, predation (from introduced species like foxes and feral cats) and fire. In contrast, the decline of bandicoots in 2010 was due to climate change and drought, weed invasion (predominantly woody weeds) and dieback (particularly Phytophthora cinnamomi). These threats in addition to some other threats (nutrient input, altered hydrological regimes and fire regimes) have degraded the health of the forests and hence bandicoot habitats in general.\"Lagging time\" needs to be considered for predictions and future projects planning\nHarris, in one of his work that published in 2009, mentioned Western pygmy possum (Cercartetus concinnus) as \"Least concern, Lower risk\" in IUCN list. At the time of his work, the species was not recognized to be endangered in the national or state level in Victoria, Western Australia or South Australia. However, at the same time, New South Wales listed this species as endangered since their distribution was threatened by massive vegetation clearing, the reduction of food sources (by overgrazing of livestock), fire regimes and introduced predators (like red fox and domestic cats) and some native Australian carnivors such as quolls, snakes and owls. \nWhile the Western pygmy possum's conservation status remained Vulnerable in AMRL in 2008  and 2014, its latest status is Critically Endangered in the Adelaide and Mt Lofty Ranges Region in 2015. This could indicate some knowledge gaps about this particular species' responses.Threatened species and ecological communities response \nDuring Ash Wednesday bushfires in the South East in Feb 1983, many areas were severely burnt (including Scrub, Whennan's, Mount McIntyre, Yeate's, Millicent Golf Course, Mount Burr Mill Drop, East McRostie's, West McRostie's, Brooksby Road and Hackett Hill), Southern brown bandicoots inhabited those areas again (except Yeate's) by as early as April 1990. The study suggested that during the Ashe Wednesday bushfires, bandicoots moved through the extensive pine plantations and migrated to native vegetation in the neighbourhood. They found dispersal corridors along the edge of the fire by using the dense ground cover. However, in Cleland and the Mt Lofty Ranges, Paull stated that \u201cIt is not known whether bandicoots survived the fires within these patches in refugal areas or whether they recolonised from neighbouring unburnt patches.\u201dThe importance of habitat quality as well as degradation/fragmentation and destruction\nThe study by Paull (1995) suggested that the response of the Southern brown bandicoot to fire (controlled burns and uncontrolled bushfires) needed to be evaluated. In his article, Paull indicated that bandicoots preferred habitats that regenerated into patchy mosaics of scrub as they were less likely to be effected by bushfires. Further studies by him confirmed that bandicoots were vulnerable because of habitat fragmentation (an outcome of extensive historical vegetation clearance) and predation by feral carnivores in the South East and Mount Lofty Ranges.Also, the Mount Lofty Ranges\u2019 Chestnut-rumped heathwren are endangered nationally and in SA according to the IUCN Red List since it has a small population and distribution which is continuing to decline further. This bird is threatened by habitat fragmentation caused by extensive land clearance through the region, residential development, invasion by woody weeds and feral predators.On the habitat quality subject for the Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis), it has been observed that when artificial burrows were offered in the field to lizards, all lizards preferred vertical burrows over angled burrows, while juvenile lizards preferred shallower burrows than did adult lizards. Observation of 36 artificial burrows showed a significant increase in lizard numbers, during 2001-02 and over three surveys. The same study suggested that this local increase in population could be due to lizards locating appropriate burrows much more easily. The overall success could be appreciated as a tool for conservation management of this endangered species. Another study compared the fitness of female pygmy blue-tongue lizards in natural burrows and artificial ones, over a 3-year period. The study showed that the females in the artificial burrows had better body conditions and produced larger offspring with better body conditions also.Cost effective monitoring\nOperations of projects are determined by district and regional priorities and resource availability such as funding and staffing. A study on Chestnut-rumped heathwren showed that to predict the risk of extinction precisely, assessment of the trends of population size and distribution are required. Therefore, choosing the most cost-effective monitoring techniques for species with low density and visibility are key factors for managers. Although effective detection of population trends is essential for managing species under threat, the main factor is the amount of money available for the monitoring technique.\n\n\n== Mount Lofty summit ==\n\nThis popular tourist destination is 727 metres (2,385 ft) above sea level. It provides sweeping vistas across the Adelaide Plains and Gulf St Vincent. Flinders Column, a white painted obelisk shaped like a lighthouse, is a landmark which can be seen from far away on a clear day.\nCar parking facilities are provided: charges are payable. Public bus route 823 serves the summit with three journeys a day (including weekends and most holidays). Other facilities include an information centre/ souvenir shop, a cafe/restaurant (closed Mondays) and public toilets.\n\n\n== Waterfall Gully ==\n\nWaterfall Gully, another popular part of the park, is located on its western edge. It can be accessed via the sealed Waterfall Gully Road. A limited amount of free car parking is provided. There is no scheduled public transport service. Other facilities include a kiosk/restaurant and public toilets.\nThe main attraction is a waterfall, the largest of several in the park. The base is a short walk from the car park and the top can be reached by a formed but steep footpath, which continues to Cleland Wildlife Park and Mount Lofty summit.\n\n\n== Other ==\nBy far the largest part of the park consists of bushland, mostly woodland with some open spaces where clearing has taken place.There are a number of walking trails, including the Waterfall Gully - Mount Lofty summit trail which is a popular and reasonably challenging ascent of the west side of Mount Lofty, and parts of the long distance Heysen and Yurrebilla Trails, which run north\u2013south along the higher ground in the east of the park.\nAs of 22 December 2012, many trails in the park became shared-use, allowing mountain bikers to also make use of the trails.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of protected areas in Adelaide\nCleland (disambiguation)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHardy, Anne (1989), The nature of Cleland (2nd ed.), State Publishing, ISBN 978-0-7243-6542-5\n\n\n== External links ==\nCleland Conservation Park official webpage\nCleland Conservation Park webpage on protected planet Media related to Cleland Wildlife Park at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Australians do not seem to do zoos like we would in the UK. There are few bars and when possible, you can go mingle with the animals. Walk amongst the kangaroos and come eye to eye with an emu. Be warned that you may not be able to hold a koala if the weather is too hot. They",
          "Spent a few hours wandering this lovely park, and even spotted wild Koala in the tress near the kangaroos. Fed the animals and generally had a great trip. Super restaurant and nice gift shop too!",
          "We really wanted to see some wild life before we went to our next destination. We read about the Cleland Wildlife and Conservation Park. It was more fun and educational than we anticipated. From the entry into the park there were signs leading us to visit and view wild animals",
          "One can spend the whole day here... The territory is enormous, and there are lots of animals to visit. Make sure you get for feeding times of koalas (can touch or hug), dingos, tasmanian devil (just one left now, and it's hiding unless it's feeding time). Exceptional experience.",
          "Lots to see as in the the beautiful animals and wildlife...There's amazing views especially from the top where there's a fab restaurant which is value for money...",
          "Breakfast with the birds is a tour you can buy from Cleland and must be booked before the day. For your money you get entry for the day, a keeper taking you on their round through the three walk-through aviaries for an hour and a half before the park is open and a fabulous",
          "I am incredibly disappointed in the way the park is managed. Don't get me wrong it's beautiful. But our main attraction is to hold a koala. What they don't tell you is that you have to line up way ahead of time to meet one and then they only allow 5 people to hold it!! So",
          "I discovered this beautiful place during my stay in Adelaide and I really liked my experience. We can touch the animals and feed them. Just wow!",
          "In 10 years this place hasn't changed - real lack of investment; dwindling number of animals and nowhere for kids to play not even a small playground. My advice save your money and look for a cheaper alternative.",
          "I\u2019m not much of a traditional zoo person. I like to see the animals in their natural habitat. There\u2019s something about cages that makes me sad. Having said that, the animals here at Cleland have so much room, they\u2019re practically free in the wild, you get in their habitat with",
          "Once one has found the Park, which can be a bit difficult, it is well worth the visit. The entrance staff are friendly and welcoming (entrance fee for 2 adults, 1 senior and 2 young children was $50). Food, specially prepared, for the animals, is a very good idea to purchase,",
          "The park is a great way to be up close with Australian wildlife. Unfortunately we booked our tour through our cruise ship and spent most of our time in the park lined up to pat the Koala. It was a great moment. The park is great, you may have to search out the animals. They are",
          "A lovely park outside Adelaide. We travelled independantly on the Adelaide Metro Bus service. Very Easy but be aware there are only a few connecting buses daily and the last one back is 4.30ish. Set out well with lots of opportunity to feed the Kangaroos. And we caught a couple",
          "A nicely laid out park specialising in Australian wildlife. Get up close and feed the kangaroos and wallabies, we even got a few photos of a baby wallaby peeking out from its mothers pouch; that made the visit. It's a comfortable stroll taking a few hours, I suggest decent",
          "Just a great day out. Set out so the animals can roam, can get up close a pat a kangaroo etc Good value for money. Well maintained park.",
          "I absolutely love visiting Cleland Wildlife Park with my daughter. We go often as this is one of our favourite places to visit. I love the staff there, the coffee and food is also good, and the best part of course is interacting with the animals. I love that they\u2019re not locked",
          "We got to pet a koala (we didn't go for the photo holding session as that was only at 2pm and you could not buy tickets in advance). We also fed some friendly kangaroos The layout of the park led for a nice 4-5 km walk & exploring the wild life",
          "A must do! We visited Adelaide for only 3 days as part of our Month long Australia trip, and this is our highlight so far. We visited another wildlife place in Sydney which was no where near as good! The park has various \u201ctypical\u201d Australian animals so we were able to tick",
          "Spend nearly half a day there.Park was huge and wildlife had ample space to roam around.Park.Receptionist was very friendly and helpful.Once in side,there is an information center where you would get maps and further information.We had a great time there and it would be an ideal",
          "We come here with almost all our visitors. It is big and spacious has a nice reptile house and most animals are visible during the day albeit some are sleepy. If you want to see all the well known animals of Australia look no further. give yourself plenty of time because",
          "We had a great time with this tour. It takes place before the park opens, and you visit all the aviaries and help feed the birds. A wonderful experience, great guide, and most of all, beautiful birds. Australia has many colorful birds. You can also revisit the park after the",
          "just a lovely place and enjoy seeing all the animals and sharing with overseas friends a lovely day out its a definite visit .",
          "This wildlife park is amazing! My absolute favorite thing that we did in Australia - and we did a lot of great things - was to feed the koalas here. It is actually more than feeding them, as we got to meet several of them, pet them, take pictures of them, and watch one of them",
          "Due to the heat, we arrived early and left about lunch-time. There was a lot that we did not see, due to our time constrictions. In hindsight I would ensure the next visit to be longer, as entry fees are quite up there when paying for a family. (A pity the packs of food not",
          "What a great place to get up close to nature. We highly recommend spending the $3 for a bag (or three in our case!) of food on your way in, as the fun we all had feeding the animals was worth every cent. We fed and patted poteroos, wallabies and kangaroos and managed to feed a",
          "I used to think that it\u2019s a lot better than Gorge Wildlife Park, as it\u2019s a lot more spacious and kept so clean by the government. But my Japanese friend found that it was too large. Nevertheless, they enjoyed their time by feeding various sizes of kangaroos. They also a nice",
          "Beautifully maintained wildlife park. A great place to see Australian wildlife up close. Breathe in the beautiful fresh Eucalyptus smell. Plenty of shady trees. A great place to take your overseas visitors. Hard to believe it is so close to Adelaide CBD.",
          "Place is geared for international visitors but local young families will pay a huge chunk of change to just see a few kangaroos and other animals you'd see around your backyard or dead on the side of the road. For about a $1 you could go to the Gumeracha Rocking Horse and have",
          "This place is awesome we have just come back from the park and it was really great getting to close to so many animals I have seen a few Wildlife parks but never seen one where u get so close to the animals all the animals are really in their natural habitat unlike other",
          "We ranged in age from 88 to 5. Everyone loved it. Did private koala experience. Expensive but worth it. Learned lots. Highly recommend.",
          "Beautiful friendly staff and kangaroos. Not too expensive and you get to feed the Kangaroos. Unfortunately too hot to hold a Koala but you could see them close up. We did hold a snake not high up on my bucket list. The staff are exceptional and very knowledgeable. Easy drive up",
          "There is plenty of parking. It is larger than you realise. It is really well done for elderly or disabled. All the enclosures have sealed paths for wheelchairs etc. You can also hire wheelchairs on arrival, whoch is great. My Mum is 88 and we would not have been able to see the",
          "We had a fabulous day at Cleland Wildlife Park. We started our day with Michelle the bird keeper, doing the bird experience. Michelle was fun, knowledgeable and informative. We had initially booked for a picnic breakfast, but due to knowledge of incoming bad weather, the staff",
          "We totally enjoyed our day at Cleland Wildlife Park in November. My favorite part? I loved holding a koala and getting photos taken. (An additional $30). It was a warm day, so only ten people were allowed to hold a koala. My tip would be to get in line early if you want to",
          "A nice spot for a family day out, good for kids to enjoy and expose to the wildlife. Will be back again with visitors",
          "A superb wild life park.....exactly what is says ....full of Australian wildlife, although the wallabies and kangaroos are willing to be hand fed! Close up encounters not to be missed. Close to koalas, dingos, Tasmanian devils, wombats....you can see them all and in wonderful",
          "The trip was really awsm..Ireally don't have any words to express my feelings...the staff was very generous n helpful...the way they were handling the kaoala in their arms feeding him giving him medicine...like a mother caring her baby..awsm..no words",
          "Finally got a chance to visit here and was not disappointed. Lovely to see relaxed, happy animals, many that wander free range through the park. Fantastic selection of breeds and varieties - especially love the wallabies! Staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Look forward to",
          "What a fantastic day. Really felt wild as opposed to confined conditions although all animals very tame. Probably needed one bag of food per person which you get when you Pay to come in. We went mad and got five but didn\u2019t use. They are well fed and half weren\u2019t",
          "Were visiting our friends in Adelaide from Scotland for a month this September and they took us for the day to Cleland. It was great - firstly getting to stroke a koala (not a bear!) then wandering among and feeding the kangaroos and joeys was special. Lovely setting high up",
          "We included visiting Adelaide into our schedule mainly because of Cleland Wildlife park, as I did want to hold a koala not want to miss it or have it spoiled by long queuing. Therefore, I booked a private koala holding experience in advance. It was very expensive, compared to",
          "Very large and spacious and so reasonably priced. Interacting with the native Australian animals in this park feels so much more relaxed and natural than it does in others.",
          "While the park is nice, it is now prohibitively expensive. It is the last time we will go here. We will now go to a much cheaper park near Cudlee Creek to hold a koala and see kangaroos.",
          "We loved our visit to Cleland. It was much bigger than we anticipated and in lovely grounds so you get a bit of exercise in too! Whilst there are not lots of species, as you would find in a zoo, all the animals are Australian and there is plenty to see; we were there for 4",
          "The good 1. Wide open spaces 2. Lots of kangaroos 3. Had a cafe on site 4. Kids loved the fact they could come close to the kangaroos The not so good 1. Ticket price seemed a bit dear considering diversity of animals were not as many as you think (adults $25.50 pp) 2.",
          "If you want to get up close and personal with kangaroos, koalas and other Australian animals, this is the place to go near Adelaide. It was a highlight of our trip.",
          "Went for koalas but ended up with biggest kangaroo love ever. Amazing to hand feed and stroke them in the big open spaces. Can\u2019t imagine you could get a better up close kangaroo experience anywhere. Hand fed kangaroos with joeys. Feed available from reception. Known for koalas",
          "We took the kids for an outing on a public holiday and was surprised that it wasn't too busy! We packed our picnic lunch and sat amongst trees and animals to enjoy our lunch. It was such a glorious day to do it. The kangaroos are very friendly and we were able to feed them",
          "Nice relaxing place to come to, a lot of walking, so comfy shoes recommended. Lots of kangaroos and wallabies to see and koalas, to cuddle if you wait for the session, 2-4pm. Adult will cost $25, concession $20, kids 15 and under $12 Great to have a picnic lunch. There is also a",
          "After two Werks traveling from Sydney, Tasmania, Melbourne via Great Ocean Road to Adelaide it was a real experience having a Long walk throug Adelaide mountains and seeing all these wonderful animals. We will come back!",
          "A lovely comfortable walking pace visit around many animals, some contact as well. Good for all the family.",
          "If you ever wanted to cuddle a koala--this is the place! A wildlife park dedicated to indigenous animals--and photo opportunities found very few places. A must-see if you are in the Adelaide area.",
          "Only 2 stars because the Koala holding arrangement is very poor with very few people able to participate even after lining up for up to 1.5 hours. Most people who queued up were turned away. Our visitor from the US was very disappointed. Poor form Cleland! You need a better",
          "FIRST I would like to say something not related directly to the Park. On Wednesday 18. July I visited the Park with my Australia family. Lost my purse with all I owned and the next day my cousin phoned to see if it had been found So sorry I am reacting so late, live in",
          "What a delightful day we spent here meeting and feeding koalas, kangaroos, and so much more. Well worth a visit",
          "A real must for taking the Grandchildren to before they grow too old to care. Many parents are too busy looking at their smartphones.",
          "Visited Cleland as part of a conference deal, so even though I went solo, we got picked up and dropped by PureSA. The wildlife park was quite fun as the map clearly states where you can see which animal and what would be the ideal time to get there (eg: feeding, koala petting",
          "Go for a day with family/kids or by yourself. You will be able to pat kangaroos, see Tasmanian devils, snakes and koalabears. They have a restaurant too with ok meals and a souvenirshop. Love the emus too.",
          "Where in the world can a person come up close to a Koala Bear and have your own picture taken within inches of this live, cute and cuddly creature. Where in the world can you feed a kangaroo in the palms of your hand with out this springy animal leaping and running away from",
          "We decided to maximize our visit by participating in all the \u201cexperiences\u201d we could! We met Fred the Wombat, fed the Koalas, watched the birds be fed, as well as having a full day of hanging out with all types of marsupials and learning from personable and knowledgeable guides.",
          "joey came over to friends Doris/Yarvard from Germany to see what we were feeding the mother kangaroo. Very impressed with Lizard/Snake room with information on each exhibit and dingos",
          "We did not have any children in our group, yet we totally enjoyed the visit. It is such a unique experience to have a kenguru it from your palm. The koala, dingo and others. What an educational experience with all the informative displays in the area. A cafeteria and souvenir",
          "Here, you can literally walk up and pat some of the animals Australia is famous for like Koalas, Kangaroos and Wombats. The koalas are of course the most popular exhibit, with lines and full sessions, so if you plan on getting your photo taken with one wrapped up in your arms,",
          "We visited on a wet wild and windy day in June. Lovely cafe to start our morning off with coffee etc. We pretty much had the park to ourselves first thing in the morning and were amazed how close you actually get to the animals. The kangaroos hop up to you for the food and eat",
          "I think this is the only place you can hold Koala for free. They do have 2 session a day and 4 Koalas for holding. Usually it\u2019s not that crowded, but by the weekend gets more busy. It\u2019s nice place to spend few hours and hold Koalas.",
          "If you'd like to get close to Australian native animals, Cleland Wildlife Park is for you. Don't forget your camera! Buy a bag of animal food at the gate ($3), and hand-feed kangaroos, wallabies, potoroos and waterfowl. There are several free keeper talks during the day, and you",
          "We had so much fun at Cleland Wildlife Park for our date day. If you're planning on taking photos of the animals, I would allow more time than recommended. We ended up spending 5 hours here, taking our time with all the animals and taking lots of snaps. The free \"personal",
          "Arrived early morning on an extremely foggy Friday. We bought our tickets, 5 packs of animal feed, and wombat encounter tickets ($25 per person, max 2). We have been to many parks that offer koala encounters but this was the first park I have seen with a wombat encounter. As",
          "The Park it self is quite good, our kids 6 and 8 years love feeding the animals. It is better to get there in the morning as by the afternoon the kangaroos are so stuffed they can barely be bothered to lift their head to eat food offered, if at all. We were very disappointed in",
          "This is halfway between a zoo and \"the wild.\" Great views of koalas and kangaroos, with petting possible of both. Also dingos, birds, emus, etc. Lots of families.",
          "It was a rainy day in adelaide, but despite that we had to see some roos on our short trip to Australia. The park was barren due to the weather. Who knew this would be the best time to visit as the animals were all excited to get some food! haha Buying tickets were no issue and",
          "The park is in the rolling hills of Adelaide's Mount Lofty Range. It houses a collection of native Australian animals and birds in 172 acres of bush land. Kangaroos, wallabies and emus run somewhat free. We saw koalas and you could wait in line to pet one or to have your picture",
          "We love the Cleland wildlife park! It\u2019s a beautiful place to visit if you have a day or afternoon free! We came with our family from America and they loved seeing all the native Australian animals! The only reason this didn\u2019t get 5 stars from me is because I feel it was a",
          "Great place to visit. You can feed the animals. The Roos will hold your hand with their long nails till they get all the pellets. Not allowed to pet the Koalas as it was too hot but understandable",
          "This is a great place to visit. You can get annual passes which makes it cheap to visit. The drive up to the park is very nice.",
          "This is a lovely park with a great location and a good selection of native animals living in mostly natural locations. (However, we have to say that some are kept in pens, presumably to stop them escaping)! We spent about 6 hours here and we especially liked the Bandicoots",
          "Well worthy of a day out! Kangaroos were very cool and clearly don\u2019t mind receiving a stroke in exchange for some food. Koalas were amazing! Staff were all very friendly and helpful especially the snake man!",
          "This amazing place never disappoints. The staff are so welcoming and friendly and the exhibits always so well presented and the array of animals on view is wonderful. I love the personalities of the animals here, they always seem to put on a good show, as if they really love",
          "I have an annual membership which is very good value. When I need to relax, and recharge, I head for Cleland, taking my kindle, drink, and just sit near the lake watching the birds, The roos have plenty of room to move without being hounded by tourists after selfies. Some",
          "Had a really nice day at the park -- spacious, peaceful, uncrowded on a weekday. The kangaroos were great, more than we saw anywhere and spread out over several large areas. Very nice exhibits.",
          "Forget about the problems of everyday life, which we all have, and spend some time enjoying nature and be grateful for living in a country such as ours.",
          "This is a very nice animal park, it\u2019s not too big so you can easily get round in half a day. Basic food in cafe reasonably priced. Go hug a koala and get your phot taken but watch out their claws are quite sharp. Luckily they are quite docile and, no, you can\u2019t take one home",
          "Our driver, Mike picked us up right on time from our hotel. He took to Mount Lofty Summit and then pack into the park. We walked around feeding kangaroos, potoroos and a variety of birds. Also plenty of information about koalas and reptiles.",
          "You wont see lions elephants and tigers. Here you will see the aussie animals. Often really close. Go there.",
          "Our original plan was to spend a morning at the park moving on for lunch at a nearby cellar door . We arrived before 10am , just the right time to catch the hourly feeding times of the different species .BUT the staff unlocked the main entrance at 6 10pm to let us out . Amazing",
          "We loved it here. Once you were through the gates it felt like a very natural environment. Lots of wide open spaces and lots of parkland. With the food to feed the kangaroos, wallabies and emus we were off and it was amazing. Very friendly animals although they didn't like",
          "Cleland is the quintessential Australian experience really...stunning bushland, beautiful views and a massive range of Australian wildlife. you could say this is one of those places to bring your out of town friends or family but it is a whole lot more than that. There is plenty",

          "A visit to Cleland fitted in nicely between wine tasting sessions. Tucked away in the hills of Mount Lofty, but definitely worth the drive. You can freely walk through the areas and feed kangaroos and see other animals up close. The koalas where taking their mid-day nap and",

          "A great day out and a great way to spend to see some of the Australian wildlife. Make sure you see the koalas and kangaroos.",
          "We rolled into the park at 4 pm. However we still managed to see a lot of lovely animals. Best about this wildlife park is that it is confined to our unique Australian species in areas as closely resembling their native habitats as possible. Even better than best is being able",
          "If you're Australian, well then you're used to seeing kangaroos and koalas. But for us visitors, this is a treat and something to tell the grandkids about for years to come. Kangaroos, wallabies, emu, birds of every imaginable size and colour, they all await your visit. You can",
          "I was so impressed with the Cleland Wildlife Park. I purchased a tour through pureSA Tours. They pick up at your hotel if you are staying in Adelaide. Mike was a wonderful driver. He knows so much about the area and I learned a lot! It was a great way to take the sites in as we",
          "The sun had come up after it rained the whole morning, what better way to spend a saturday afternoon than at cleeland. Kangaroos, ducks, birds and other wildlife animals roam free in the park which makes it very interactive as you can feed them too! Lovely nature walk and lots",
          "If you are an international visitor or just a local family wanting an educational day out, this is THE place to go to see most of what Australia has to offer in the way of animals. A bit pricey to get it at $25 person or $54 for a family of 2 adults and 2 children but this",
          "This has been the best wildlife spotting during our 3 week holiday in Australia, which also adults will enjoy for whom it is important that animals are kept in a respectful way. Great infos, you can get real close to all animals and they have a huge space. You can easily spend",
          "You need to pay the $30 to hold the Koala bear in your arms; it is worth it. The Koala is very soft unlike the Panda bear which is like holding a giant brillo pad. They have the Tasmanian devil but it did not spin around like in the cartoons. This place reminds of San Diego wild",
          "Went with some friends on an overcast day, although a bit chilly we had a great time. Lots of animals to see and feeding them was good fun. The animals seemed very well cared for, curious and friendly, lots of little joeys to see :)",

          "I went there with my husband & two young children. We had a fantastic time. The grounds have really great paths to push a problem or stroller & the people there were so friendly & really got the girls excited about seeing & touching some of the animals. Such a fantastic day",
          "I went the on 19 July. I costed me 25 AUD for the entering fee but I think it was really worth it coz there are a lot of exotic animals there not only that but also you can get so close to them. You can feed the Kangaroos and other animals and play with them.",
          "We took our two kids to cleland on a rainy day and had a ball! The koala close up was fun, our kids loved feeding the small animals and patting the kangaroos too. It's really so close to Adelaide, easy parking and a casual restaurant/cafe serving ok food (great wedges and hot",
          "You walk around kangaroos and emus and can actually feed them and see them up close. The whole family loved it. And the picture opportunity with a sleepy koala was lots of fun. Fantastic afternoon.",
          "I'm from Vic where it isn't legal to actually hold one of the delightful creatures. I was impressed by how sensitive the handlers were to the Koala's feelings and they didn't hesitate to return a koala to their home if they felt they weren't in the mood for a close up. The park",

          "This is a great place to take the kids and visitors. Brilliant location. Loads of opportunities to interact with wildlife. If you live locally buy an annual pass, good value for money.",
          "What a great place to visit, you can walk up to the wild life and feed them if you choose to do so. A walk into the reptile enclosure is a must to see the dreaded tiger and the common brown snake. These are some of the deadliest snakes in the world. A bite from one of these",
          "It is such a huge park. We enjoyed feeding the animals especially wallabies, kangaroos and ducks. Had a closer look at animals. Had a good walk too.",
          "Cleland is fabulous and a must for any visitors/tourists! You can pay a bit extra for a koala hold experience but if you don't want to pay extra you can still have a few minutes up close with stroking and pictures at no extra cost. You queue up for a little bit and they let you",
          "Contrary to popular belief, Kangaroos don't hop down your street, unless you live in the country, and then it is rare and they are shy of people. So a chance to go and see Kangaroos close up and feed them is a chance that you have to take even if it is only once in your life.",

          "This park is amazing, you can feed kangaroos and emus. The best part of the whole park is being able to hold a Koala, there is an additional fee for this but is TOTALLY worth it. I suggest everyone see this park",
          "The approach to Cleland Wildlife Park is scenic whether you drive, travel on public transport or walk from Waterfall Gully. Once there the Australian animals are plentiful, diverse and interesting. Staff are friendly and informative. The Koala experience is exceptional. The cafe",
          "My children and I traveled here, to be greeted by lots, and I mean lots! of little cuties to hand feed, the minute we walked through the entrance. The kids were sold! We purchased the bags of pellets at $3, to hand feed the Potaroos (I think that's what they are, but who cares,",
          "Was a wonderful place just to wander around at your own pace watching the animals doing their thing, weather was good thankfully no rain.... Cafe was nice with a good choice of food",
          "In this wildlife park, many animals (kangaroos, bandicoots, wallabies etc.) are given free reign around the park, and they are so tame that we had a great deal of fun petting and feeding the animals. In addition, you really get to see a wide range of Australian animals up close",
          "The place was absolutely stunning. Everywhere animals which include kangaroos, koalas, emus and wallabies. The nature was really fascinating with it's trees and green nature. The place offers to hold a koala which I would totally recommend. It's also disabled friendly and you",

          "My fianc\u00e9 was thrilled to be able to hold a koala. Better yet, the free roaming animals were very tame and happy to eat off your hands, it was a unique experience. It is a little hard to get to if you don't drive, but we were lucky to get a cabby that was willing to pick us up.",
          "We have been to many wildlife attractions across Australia, and have seen our fair share of extremely good and poor ones, and when we pulled up outside the Cleland Wildlife Park, we thought it looked like one of the poor ones, and when we saw that it was $25 each, we almost",

          "The park is wide and spacious and it was good to see that most of the animals could roam freely. It was fun feeding the kangaroos in the open spaces and there were so many of them. Even the emus came near to watch! We could stroke and touch a koala bear for free, and paid AUD30",

          "This is an extensive wildlife park with many interesting walking pathways. On each pathway are enclosures with local Australian animals, birds, etc. It was fascinating to see the big red kangaroos right out in the open alongside the grey kangaroos. We saw wallabys, dingos,",
          "You can spend as much time as you like with the kangaroos, just buy the feed. You can see a variety of animals, including Tasmanian Devils and pootaroos, which look a lot like large rats to me. There is a line to hold the koalas and the handlers have to change out the animals",

          "We have visited Cleland many times over perhaps four decades. It is a picturesque park full of Australian wild life, from various species of kangaroo, koalas, wombats and emus to snakes in the reptile house. When we have had friends and family in from overseas we have taken them",
          "Excellent place to visit. We are lucky enough to live quite close and have been visiting regularly for years, first with our children and now our grandchildren. No matter how often we go there is always something to delight the children and several hours can easily be whiled",

          "We went here for a morning walk, we ended up getting lost (not in the bush on a safe trail) and ended up walking for about two hours. We say a number of Koalas and a couple of Kangaroos. The caf\u00e9 on the way home had lovely coffee and cake.",
          "I love this place! You can feed the kangaroos and wallabies and potoroos and enjoy strolling the whole place. It's a lovely location and the grounds are beautiful. You can touch a koala if you go at the right time. For an American, seeing all the animals was a real thrill.",

          "For anyone with international visitors coming to Australia, this is the go to place no matter where you live. It is worth any costs you have to incur to get there. Local Zoo visits are also a must, but the ability to personally interact with the animals at Cleland is second to",
          "This was a fab day out and was made even better by combining it with Mount Lofty, which was only a few minutes drive. Once inside Cleland, it's formatted like a natural park, with only the dangerous out of reach. We made a point of what times were the koala close-ups and holds.",
          "We went up to Cleland on a cool day and we're greater by a wonderful fire in the main building. We got up close and fed the kangaroos and had so much fun under the tall trees of Cleland. Amazing bird life, various Australian animals and touched a lizard. A must for anyone",
          "We went without any expectation and we were blown away. Coming from overseas (Canada) one of our main goals in Australia was to see the Aussie animals and this is WITHOUT A DOUBT, the best place to experience encounters. And it is actually affordable when compared to other zoos",
          "As a bird lover I enjoyed being able to wander through 3 bird aviaries in addition to checking out the birds that call the lake a home. Every inhabitant of the wildlife park calls Australia home and the visitor can close to the kangaroos, wallabies and koalas all located amongst",

        "wiki": "Adelaide ( (listen) AD-\u0259-layd) is the capital city of the state of South Australia, and the fifth-most populous city of Australia. The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide.\nAdelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its metropolitan area extends 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches 96 km (60 mi) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south.\nNamed in honour of Queen Adelaide, consort to King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia. Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens, in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga (\"place of the red kangaroo\"). Light's design, now listed as national heritage, set out the city centre in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands.\nEarly colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. Until the post-war era, it was Australia's third-largest city. It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the \"City of Churches\" due to its diversity of faiths. Today, Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. Adelaide's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century.\nAs South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevards of North Terrace and King William Street.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before European settlement ===\n\nBefore its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous Kaurna people, one of many Aboriginal nations in South Australia. The city and parklands area was known as Tarntanya, or Tarndanyangga in the Kaurna language. The surrounding area was an open grassy plain with patches of trees and shrub which had been managed by hundreds of generations. Kaurna country encompassed the plains which stretched north and south of Tarntanya as well as the wooded foothills of the Mt Lofty Ranges. The River Torrens was known as the Karrawirra Pari (red gum forest river). About 300 Kaurna populated the Adelaide area, and were referred to by the settlers as the Cowandilla.The Kaurna language was a complex one, reflecting their sophisticated culture and deep environmental knowledge. Within a few decades of European settlement of South Australia, Kaurna culture and language were almost completely destroyed. Extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both, which has included a commitment by local and state governments to rename or include Kaurna names for many local places.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nSouth Australia was officially established as a British Province in England in February 1836. The first Governor \nproclaimed the commencement of colonial government in South Australia on 28 December 1836, near The Old Gum Tree in what is now the suburb of Glenelg North. The event is commemorated in South Australia as Proclamation Day. The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, with his own original, unique, topographically sensitive design.\nClaims of the design being by the architect George Strickland Kingston have been thoroughly debunked. The city was named after Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, queen consort to King William IV at the time.Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress, and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals. Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen. Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working-class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land. As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share the convict settlement history of other Australian cities like Sydney, Brisbane and Hobart.\n\nAs it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. But by mid-1837 the South Australian Register was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now the South Australia Police) in April 1838 under 21-year-old Henry Inman. The first sheriff, Samuel Smart, was wounded during a robbery, and on 2 May 1838 one of the offenders, Michael Magee, became the first person to be hanged in South Australia. William Baker Ashton was appointed governor of the temporary gaol in 1839, and in 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design Adelaide's new gaol. Construction of Adelaide Gaol commenced in 1841.Adelaide's early history was marked by economic uncertainty and questionable leadership. The first governor of South Australia, John Hindmarsh, clashed frequently with others, in particular the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over 405 km2 (156 sq mi) of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from Encounter Bay in the south to Clare in the north.\n\nGeorge Gawler took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the Select Committee on South Australia in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the Adelaide Gaol, police barracks, a hospital, a customs house and a wharf at Port Adelaide. Gawler was recalled and replaced by George Edward Grey in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in Glen Osmond that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.\nTrade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the Murray River was successfully navigated in 1853 by Francis Cadell, an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a self-governing colony in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. Secret ballots were introduced, and a bicameral parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the University of Adelaide was founded in 1874, the South Australian Art Gallery opened in 1881 and the Happy Valley Reservoir opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at Broken Hill provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAdelaide was Australia's third largest city for most of the 20th century. Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Historian F. W. Crowley examined the reports of visitors in the early 20th century, noting that \"many visitors to Adelaide admired the foresighted planning of its founders\", as well as pondering the riches of the young city. Adelaide enjoyed a postwar boom, entering a time of relative prosperity. Its population grew, and it became the third most populous metropolitan area in the country, after Sydney and Melbourne. Its prosperity was short-lived, with the return of droughts and the Great Depression of the 1930s. It later returned to fortune under strong government leadership. Secondary industries helped reduce the state's dependence on primary industries. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the Playford Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of Whyalla.\nThe South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries but neglected cultural facilities which meant South Australia's economy lagged behind. International manufacturers like General Motors Holden and Chrysler made use of these factories around the Adelaide area in suburbs like Elizabeth, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. The Mannum\u2013Adelaide pipeline brought River Murray water to Adelaide in 1955 and an airport opened at West Beach in 1955. Flinders University and the Flinders Medical Centre were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, south of the city. Today, Flinders Medical Centre is one of the largest teaching hospitals in South Australia. In the post-war years around the early 1960s Adelaide was surpassed by Brisbane as Australia's third largest city.The Dunstan Governments of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival', establishing a wide array of social reforms. The city became noted for its progressivism as South Australia became the first Australian state or territory to decriminalise homosexuality between consenting adults in 1975. It also became a centre for the arts, building upon the biennial \"Adelaide Festival of Arts\" that commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the Formula One Australian Grand Prix between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands; it moved to Melbourne in 1996. The State Bank collapsed in 1991 during an economic recession; the effects lasted until 2004, when Standard & Poor's reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating. Since 1999, the Adelaide 500 Supercars race has made use of sections of the former Formula One circuit. Adelaide's tallest building, built in 1988, was originally known as the State Bank Building. In 1991 it was renamed the Santos Building and in 2006 it was renamed Westpac House, and it is currently the 160th tallest building in Australia.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century, a significant increase in the state government's spending on Adelaide's infrastructure occurred. The Rann government invested A$535 million in a major upgrade of the Adelaide Oval to enable Australian Football League to be played in the city centre and more than A$2 billion to build a new Royal Adelaide Hospital on land adjacent to the Adelaide Railway Station. The Glenelg tramline was extended through the city to Hindmarsh down to East Terrace and the suburban railway line extended south to Seaford.Following a period of stagnation in the 1990s and 2000s, Adelaide began several major developments and redevelopments. The Adelaide Convention Centre was redeveloped and expanded at a cost of A$350 million beginning in 2012. Three historic buildings were adapted for modern use: the Torrens Building in Victoria Square as the Adelaide campus for Carnegie Mellon University, University College London, and Torrens University; the Stock Exchange building as the Science Exchange of the Royal Institution Australia; and the Glenside Psychiatric Hospital as the Adelaide Studios of the SA Film Corporation. The government also invested more than A$2 billion to build a desalination plant, powered by renewable energy, as an 'insurance policy' against droughts affecting Adelaide's water supply. The Adelaide Festival, Fringe, and Womadelaide became annual events.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAdelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills, and 90 km (56 mi) from Gawler at its northern extent to Sellicks Beach in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia, an Australian government planning initiative, the \"Adelaide Metropolitan Region\" has a total land area of 870 km2 (340 sq mi), while a more expansive definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a \"Greater Adelaide\" statistical area totalling 3,259.8 km2 (1,258.6 sq mi). The city sits at an average elevation of 50 metres (160 ft) above sea level. Mount Lofty, east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of 727 metres (2,385 ft), is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of Burra.\n\nMuch of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation \u2013 sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the Cleland Conservation Park and Belair National Park. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and Onkaparinga catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the Happy Valley Reservoir supplying around 40% and the much larger Mount Bold Reservoir 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.\nAdelaide and its surrounding area is one of the most seismically active regions in Australia. On 1 March 1954 at 3:40 am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date, with the epicentre 12 km from the city centre at Darlington, and a reported magnitude of 5.6. There have been smaller earthquakes in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\n=== Urban layout ===\nAdelaide is a planned city, designed by the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, Colonel William Light. His plan, sometimes referred to as \"Light's Vision\" (also the name of a statue of him on Montefiore Hill), arranged Adelaide in a grid, with five squares in the Adelaide city centre and a ring of parks, known as the Adelaide Parklands, surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there. Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George Kingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates for city plans going back to Ancient Greece, including Italian Renaissance designs and the similar layouts of the American cities Philadelphia and Savannah\u2013which, like Adelaide, follow the same layout of a central city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that surround the city centre.The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable cardinal direction grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of ring roads in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The inner ring route (A21) borders the parklands, and the outer route (A3/A13/A16/A17) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) Grand Junction Road, Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, Portrush Road, Cross Road and South Road.\n\nSuburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and \"country towns\", as well as the satellite city of Elizabeth, have been enveloped by its suburban sprawl. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the South Eastern Freeway to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's South led to the construction of the Southern Expressway.\nNew roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The O-Bahn Busway is an example of a unique solution to Tea Tree Gully's transport woes in the 1980s. The development of the nearby suburb of Golden Grove in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.\n\nIn the 1960s, a Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study Plan was proposed to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, expressways and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier Steele Hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later Labor government elected under Don Dunstan shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the Liberal party won government and premier David Tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.\nIn 2008, the SA Government announced plans for a network of transport-oriented developments across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a 10 hectare industrial site at Bowden for $52.5 million as the first of these developments. The site covers 102,478 square metres, or about 10 hectares, and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the Adelaide to Outer Harbour railway line to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east.\n\n\n==== Housing ====\n\nHistorically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on 1,000-square-metre (1\u20444-acre) blocks. A relative lack of suitable, locally-available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.There is a wide variety in the styles of these houses. Until the 1960s most of the more substantial houses were built of red brick, though many front walls were of ornamental stone. Then cream bricks became fashionable, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular. Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with (painted) corrugated iron or tiles (cement or clay, usually red \"terracotta\"). Since then, Colorbond corrugated steel has dominated. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, most houses were of \"double brick\" construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by \"dwarf walls\". Later houses have mainly been of \"brick veneer\" construction \u2013 structural timber or, more recently, lightweight steel frame on a concrete slab foundation, lined with Gyprock, and with an outer skin of brickwork, to cope with Adelaide's reactive soils, particularly Keswick Clay, black earth and some red-brown earth soils. The use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased. In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the South Australian Housing Trust.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAdelaide has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa). The city has hot, dry summers and mild to cool winters with moderate rainfall. Most precipitation falls in the winter months, leading to the suggestion that the climate be classified as a \"cold monsoon\". Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer, although heavy falls can occur. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80 mm. Frosts are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city with significant wind chill in winter, which makes the temperature seem colder than it actually is. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon, although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at Mount Lofty occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from 8 to 10 \u00b0C (46 to 50 \u00b0F). There are usually several days in summer where the temperature reaches 40.0 \u00b0C (104.0 \u00b0F) or above; the frequency of these temperatures has been increasing in recent years.\nThe average sea temperature ranges from 13.7 \u00b0C (56.7 \u00b0F) in August to 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F) in February.\n\n\n=== Liveability ===\nAdelaide has been consistently listed in the world's top 10 most liveable cities through the 2010s by The Economist Intelligence Unit, although it dropped to tenth place in 2018 after holding fifth position in the previous three years. It was ranked the most liveable city in Australia by the Property Council of Australia, based on surveys of residents\u2019 views of their own city, between 2010 and 2013, dropping to second place in 2014. Greener spaces for sustainable living is an initiative that has proven to create happier residents and is one of the factors that contributes to Adelaide making the top 10 of the world's most liveable cities. For a relatively small city it boasts 29 large public parks as well as a botanical garden in the heart of the city. The reduction of Adelaide's tree canopy cover over recent years due to excessive tree removal for new construction has led to an increase in the cost of housing and a decrease of overall state of well-being.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nAdelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the Government of South Australia. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the City of Adelaide. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the State Government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The State Parliament's Capital City Committee is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.\nReflecting South Australia's status as Australia's most centralised state, Adelaide elects a substantial majority of the South Australian House of Assembly. Of the 47 seats in the chamber, 34 seats (three-quarters of the legislature) are based in Adelaide, and two rural seats include Adelaide suburbs.\n\n\n=== Local governments ===\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between nineteen local government areas. At its centre, the City of Adelaide administers the Adelaide city centre, North Adelaide, and the surrounding Adelaide Parklands. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, James Hurtle Fisher, was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a Lord Mayor, the current being Lord Mayor The Right Honourable Sandy Verschoor.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAdelaide's inhabitants are known as Adelaideans.Compared with Australia's four other major state capitals, Adelaide is growing at a much slower rate. In 2017, it had a metropolitan population (including suburbs) of more than 1,345,777, making it Australia's fifth-largest city. Some 77% of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states.\nMajor areas of population growth in recent years have been in outer suburbs such as Mawson Lakes and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,413 flats, units or apartments.About one sixth (17.1%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.\nAdelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. More than a quarter (27.5%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55 years or older, in comparison to the national average of 25.6%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15-year-olds), who comprised 17.7% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.3%.\n\n\n=== Ancestry and immigration ===\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:\n\nOverseas-born Adelaideans composed 31.8% of the total population at the 2016 census. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (6.2%), India (2%), China (1.8%), Italy (1.3%) and Vietnam (1.1%).Suburbs including Newton, Payneham and Campbelltown in the east and Torrensville, West Lakes and Fulham to the west, have large Greek and Italian communities. The Italian consulate is located in the eastern suburb of Payneham. Large Vietnamese populations are settled in the north-western suburbs of Woodville, Kilkenny, Pennington, Mansfield Park and Athol Park and also Parafield Gardens and Pooraka in Adelaide's north. Migrants from India and Sri Lanka have settled into inner suburban areas of Adelaide including the inner northern suburbs of Blair Athol, Kilburn and Enfield and the inner southern suburbs of Plympton, Park Holme and Kurralta Park.\n\nSuburbs such as Para Hills, Salisbury, Ingle Farm and Blair Athol in the north and Findon, West Croydon and Seaton and other Western suburbs have sizeable Afghan communities. Chinese migrants favour settling in the eastern and north eastern suburbs including Kensington Gardens, Greenacres, Modbury and Golden Grove. Mawson Lakes has a large international student population, due to its proximity to the University of South Australia campus.1.4% of the population, or 18,403 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nAt the 2016 census, 75.4% of the population spoke English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Italian (2.1%), Standard Mandarin (2.1%), Greek (1.7%) Vietnamese (1.4%), and Cantonese (0.7%).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAdelaide was founded on a vision of religious tolerance that attracted a wide variety of religious practitioners. This led to it being known as The City of Churches. But approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of Australia's least religious cities. Over half of the population of Adelaide identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being Catholic (21.3%), Anglican (12.6%), Uniting Church (7.6%) and Eastern Orthodox (3.5%).The Jewish community of the city dates back to 1840. Eight years later, 58 Jews lived in the city. A synagogue was built in 1871, when 435 Jews lived in the city. Many took part in the city councils, such as Judah Moss Solomon (1852\u201366) and others after him. Three Jews have been elected to the position of city mayor. In 1968, the Jewish population of Adelaide numbered about 1,200; in 2001, according to the Australian census, 979 persons declared themselves to be Jewish by religion. In 2011, over 1,000 Jews were living in the city, operating an orthodox and a reform school, in addition to a virtual Jewish museum.The \"Afghan\" community in Australia first became established in the 1860s when camels and their Pathan, Punjabi, Baluchi and Sindhi handlers began to be used to open up settlement in the continent's arid interior. Until eventually superseded by the advent of the railways and motor vehicles, camels played an invaluable economic and social role in transporting heavy loads of goods to and from isolated settlements and mines. This is acknowledged by the name of The Ghan, the passenger train operating between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin. The Central Adelaide Mosque is regarded as Australia's oldest permanent mosque; an earlier mosque at Marree in northern South Australia, dating from 1861 to 1862 and subsequently abandoned or demolished, has now been rebuilt.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSouth Australia's largest employment sectors are health care and social assistance, surpassing manufacturing in SA as the largest employer since 2006\u201307. In 2009\u201310, manufacturing in SA had average annual employment of 83,700 persons compared with 103,300 for health care and social assistance. Health care and social assistance represented nearly 13% of the state average annual employment. The Adelaide Hills wine region is an iconic and viable economic region for both the state and country in terms of wine production and sale. The 2014 vintage is reported as consisting of 5,836 t (5,744 long tons; 6,433 short tons) red grapes crushed valued at A$8,196,142 and 12,037 t (11,847 long tons; 13,269 short tons) white grapes crushed valued at $14,777,631.The retail trade is the second largest employer in SA (2009\u201310), with 91,900 jobs, and 12 per cent of the state workforce.Manufacturing, defence technology, high-tech electronic systems and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries all play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia were made in Adelaide at the General Motors Holden plant in Elizabeth. The site ceased operating in November 2017.\nThe collapse of the State Bank in 1992 resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4 billion). The collapse meant that successive governments enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which was a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has more recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.The global media conglomerate News Corporation was founded in, and until 2004 incorporated in, Adelaide and it is still considered its 'spiritual' home by Rupert Murdoch. Australia's largest oil company, Santos, prominent South Australian brewery, Coopers, and national retailer Harris Scarfe also call Adelaide their home.\nThe city has been chosen to be the site of the new Australian space center. South Australia is already home to over 80 organisations which employ 800 people in the space sector. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated the \"agency will act as a launching pad to triple Australia's space economy to $12 billion and create up to 20,000 jobs by 2030.\"\n\n\n=== Defence industry ===\n\nAdelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1 billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. The principal government military research institution, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, and other defence technology organisations such as BAE Systems Australia and Lockheed Martin Australia, are north of Salisbury and west of Elizabeth in an area now called \"Edinburgh Parks\", adjacent to RAAF Base Edinburgh.\nOthers, such as Saab Systems and Raytheon, are in or near Technology Park. ASC Pty Ltd, is based in the industrial suburb of Osborne and is also a part of Technology Park. South Australia was charged with constructing Australia's Collins class submarines and more recently the A$6 billion contract to construct the Royal Australian Navy's new air-warfare destroyers.\n\n\n=== Employment statistics ===\nAs of November 2015, Greater Adelaide had an unemployment rate of 7.4% with a youth unemployment rate of 15%.The median weekly individual income for people aged 15 years and over was $447 per week in 2006, compared with $466 nationally. The median family income was $1,137 per week, compared with $1,171 nationally. Adelaide's housing and living costs are substantially lower than that of other Australian cities, with housing being notably cheaper. The median Adelaide house price is half that of Sydney and two-thirds that of Melbourne. The three-month trend unemployment rate to March 2007 was 6.2%. The Northern suburbs' unemployment rate is disproportionately higher than the other regions of Adelaide at 8.3%, while the East and South are lower than the Adelaide average at 4.9% and 5.0% respectively.\n\n\n=== House prices ===\nOver the decade March 2001 \u2013 March 2010, Metropolitan Adelaide median house prices approximately tripled. (approx. 285% \u2013 approx. 11%p.a. compounding)\nIn the five years March 2007 \u2013 March 2012, prices increased by approx. 27% \u2013 approx. 5%p.a. compounding. March 2012 \u2013 March 2017 saw a further increase of 19% \u2013 approx. 3.5%p.a. compounding.In summary:\n\nEach quarter, The Alternative and Direct Investment Securities Association (ADISA) publishes a list of median house sale prices by suburb and Local Government Area. (Previously, this was done by REISA) Due to the small sizes of many of Adelaide's suburbs, the low volumes of sales in these suburbs, and (over time) the huge variations in the numbers of sales in a suburb in a quarter, statistical analysis of \"the most expensive suburb\" is unreliable; the suburbs appearing in the \"top 10 most expensive suburbs this quarter\" list is constantly varying. Quarterly Reports for the last two years can be found on the REISA website.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\n\nEducation forms an increasingly important part of the city's economy, with the South Australian Government and educational institutions attempting to position Adelaide as \"Australia's education hub\" and marketing it as a \"Learning City.\" The number of international students studying in Adelaide has increased rapidly in recent years to 30,726 in 2015, of which 1,824 were secondary school students. In addition to the city's existing institutions, foreign institutions have been attracted to set up campuses to increase its attractiveness as an education hub. Adelaide is the birthplace of three Nobel laureates, more than any other Australian city: physicist William Lawrence Bragg and pathologists Howard Florey and Robin Warren, all of whom completed secondary and tertiary education at St Peter's College and the University of Adelaide.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nAt the level of primary and secondary education, there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of independent and Catholic schools. All schools provide education under the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the International Baccalaureate (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\n\nThere are three public universities local to Adelaide, as well as one private university and three constituent colleges of foreign universities. Flinders University of South Australia, the University of Adelaide, the University of South Australia and Torrens University Australia\u2014part of the Laureate International Universities are based in Adelaide. The University of Adelaide was ranked in the top 150 universities worldwide. Flinders ranked in the top 250 and Uni SA in the top 300. Torrens University Australia is part of an international network of over 70 higher education institutions in more than 30 countries worldwide. The historic Torrens Building in Victoria Square houses Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College Australia, and University College London's School of Energy and Resources (Australia), and constitute the city's international university precinct.The University of Adelaide, with 25,000 students, is Australia's third-oldest university and a member of the leading \"Group of Eight\". It has five campuses throughout the state, including two in the city-centre, and a campus in Singapore. The University of South Australia, with 37,000 students, has two North Terrace campuses, three other campuses in the metropolitan area and campuses at Whyalla and Mount Gambier. Flinders University, with 25,184 domestic and international students, is in the southern suburb of Bedford Park, alongside the Flinders Medical Centre, another campus in neighbouring Tonsley, and maintains a small city campus in Victoria Square. The plaza on the Bedford Park campus was revamped in 2014 and officially re-opened in 2016.There are several South Australian TAFE (Technical and Further Education) campuses in the metropolitan area that provide a range of vocational education and training. The Adelaide College of the Arts, as a school of TAFE SA, provides nationally recognised training in visual and performing arts.\n\n\n=== Research ===\nIn addition to the universities, Adelaide is home to a number of research institutes, including the Royal Institution of Australia, established in 2009 as a counterpart to the two-hundred-year-old Royal Institution of Great Britain. Many of the organisations involved in research tend to be geographically clustered throughout the Adelaide metropolitan area:\n\nThe east end of North Terrace: SA Pathology; Hanson Institute; RAH; National Wine Centre.\nThe west end of North Terrace: South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), located next to the new Royal Adelaide Hospital.\nThe Waite Research Precinct: SARDI Head Office and Plant Research Centre; AWRI; ACPFG; CSIRO research laboratories. SARDI also has establishments at Glenside and West Beach.\nEdinburgh, South Australia: DSTO; BAE Systems (Australia); Lockheed Martin Australia Electronic Systems.\nTechnology Park (Mawson Lakes): BAE Systems; Optus; Raytheon; Topcon; Lockheed Martin Australia Electronic Systems.\nResearch Park at Thebarton: businesses involved in materials engineering, biotechnology, environmental services, information technology, industrial design, laser/optics technology, health products, engineering services, radar systems, telecommunications and petroleum services.\nScience Park (adjacent to Flinders University): Playford Capital.\nThe Basil Hetzel Institute for Translational Health Research in Woodville the research arm of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute, a global research collaboration for evidence-based healthcare with its headquarters in North Adelaide.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cultural life ==\n\nWhile established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the vine cuttings that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the Barossa Valley.\nThe Royal Adelaide Show is an annual agricultural show and state fair, established in 1839 and now a huge event held in the Adelaide Showground annually.\nAdelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers from both major political parties. The renowned Adelaide Festival of Arts was established in 1960 under Thomas Playford, which in the same year spawned an unofficial uncurated series of performances and exhibits which grew into the Adelaide Fringe. Construction of the Adelaide Festival Centre began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the South Australian Film Corporation in 1972 and the State Opera of South Australia in 1976.\nOver time, the Adelaide Festival expanded to include Adelaide Writers' Week and WOMADelaide, and other separate festivals were established, such as the Adelaide Cabaret Festival (2002), the Adelaide Festival of Ideas (1999), the Adelaide Film Festival (2013), FEAST (1999, a queer culture) and Tasting Australia (1997, a food and wine affair). With the Festival, the Fringe, WOMADelaide, Writers' Week and the Adelaide 500 street motor racing event (along with evening music concerts) all happening in early March, the period has become known colloquially as \"Mad March\".\n\nIn 2014, Ghil'ad Zuckermann founded the Adelaide Language Festival.There are many international cultural fairs, most notably the German Sch\u00fctzenfest and Greek Glendi. Adelaide is home to the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, the world's largest Christmas parade.\n\n\n=== North Terrace institutions ===\nAs the state capital, Adelaide is home to a great number of cultural institutions with many along the boulevard of North Terrace. The Art Gallery of South Australia, with around 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection. Adjacent are the South Australian Museum and State Library of South Australia, while the Adelaide Botanic Garden, National Wine Centre and Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute are nearby in the East End of the city. In the back of the State Library lies the Migration Museum, Australia's oldest museum of its kind.\nFurther west, the Lion Arts Centre is home to ACE Open, which showcases contemporary art, Dance Hub SA and other studio and arts industry office spaces. The Mercury Cinema and JamFactory (ceramics and design gallery) are just around the corner.\n\n\n=== Performing arts and music venues ===\n\nThe Adelaide Festival Centre (which includes the Dunstan Playhouse, Festival Theatre and Space Theatre), on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the State Theatre Company of South Australia. Other live music and theatre venues include the Adelaide Entertainment Centre; Adelaide Oval; Memorial Drive Park; Thebarton Theatre; Adelaide Town Hall; Her Majesty's Theatre; Queen's Theatre; Holden Theatres and the Hopgood Theatre.\nThe Lion Arts Factory, within the Lion Arts Centre, hosts contemporary music in a wide range of genres, as does \"The Gov\" in Hindmarsh. The city also has numerous smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars which host performances.\n\n\n=== Live music ===\n\nIn 2015, it was said that there were now more live music venues per capita in Adelaide than any other capital city in the southern hemisphere, Lonely Planet labelled Adelaide \"Australia's live music city\", and the city was recognised as a \"City of Music\" by the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.In addition to its own WOMADelaide, Adelaide attracts several touring music festivals, including Creamfields, Laneway and Groovin'.\nAdelaide has produced musical groups and individuals who have achieved national and international fame. These include the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, the Adelaide Youth Orchestra, rock bands The Angels, Cold Chisel, The Superjesus, Wolf & Cub, roots/blues group The Audreys, internationally acclaimed metal acts I Killed The Prom Queen and Double Dragon, popular Australian hip-hop outfit Hilltop Hoods, pop acts like Sia, Orianthi, Guy Sebastian, and Wes Carr, as well as internationally successful tribute act, The Australian Pink Floyd Show.\nNoted rocker Jimmy Barnes (formerly lead vocalist with Cold Chisel) spent most of his youth in the northern suburb of Elizabeth. Paul Kelly grew up in Adelaide and was head prefect at Rostrevor College. The first Australian Idol winner, Guy Sebastian, hails from the north-eastern suburb of Golden Grove.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\nAdelaide plays host to two of Australia's leading contemporary dance companies. The Australian Dance Theatre and Dance Hub SA (formerly Leigh Warren & Dancers) contribute to state festivals and perform nationally and internationally. Restless Dance Theatre is also based in Adelaide and is nationally recognised for working with disabled and non-disabled dancers to use movement as a means of expression.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nNewspapers in Adelaide are dominated by News Corporation publications\u2014Adelaide being the birthplace of News Corporation itself. The only South Australian daily newspaper is The Advertiser, published by News Corporation six days a week. The same group publishes a Sunday paper, the Sunday Mail.\nThere are eleven suburban community newspapers published weekly, known collectively as the Messenger Newspapers, also published by a subsidiary of News Corporation. The Independent Weekly was a small independent newspaper providing an alternative view, but ceased publishing its print edition in November 2010 and now exists as a digital daily newsletter only, InDaily. The Adelaide Review is a free paper published monthly, and other independent magazine-style papers are published, but are not as widely available.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nAdelaide is served by numerous digital free-to-air television channels:\n\nAll of the five Australian national television networks broadcast both high-definition digital and standard-definition digital television services in Adelaide. They share three transmission towers on the ridge near the summit of Mount Lofty. There are two other transmission sites at 25 Grenfell Street, Adelaide and Elizabeth Downs. The two government-funded stations are run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC South Australia) and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). The Seven Network and Network Ten both own their Adelaide stations (SAS-7 and ADS-10 respectively). Adelaide's NWS-9 is part of the Nine Network. Adelaide also has a community television station, Channel 44.\nAs part of a nationwide phase-out of analogue television in Australia, Adelaide's analogue television service was shut down on 2 April 2013.The Foxtel pay TV service is also available via cable or satellite to the entire metropolitan area.\nAll the major broadcasting networks also operate online on-demand television services, alongside internet-only services such as Stan, Fetch TV, Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and Kayo Sports.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\n\nThere are 20 radio stations that serve the metropolitan area, as well as four stations that serve only parts of the metropolitan area; six commercial stations, six community stations, six national stations and two narrowcast stations.DAB+ digital radio has been broadcasting in metropolitan Adelaide since 20 May 2009, and currently offers a choice of 41 stations all operated by the existing licensed radio broadcasters, which includes high-quality simulcast of all AM and FM stations.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe main sports played professionally in Adelaide are Australian Rules football, association football (soccer), cricket, netball, and basketball. Adelaide is the home of two Australian Football League teams: the Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club, and one A-League soccer team, Adelaide United. A local Australian rules football league, the SANFL, is made up of 10 teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFL) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1927. The SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.\nAdelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events. Until the completion of the 2012\u201314 renovation and upgrade of the Adelaide Oval, most large sporting events took place at either AAMI Stadium (the then home base of the Adelaide Crows, and the then Port Adelaide's home game venue), or the historic Adelaide Oval, home of the Southern Redbacks and the Adelaide Strikers cricket teams. Since completion of the upgrade, home games for Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide now take place at Adelaide Oval.\nSince 1884, Adelaide Oval has also hosted an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of One Day International cricket matches. Memorial Drive Park, adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host Davis Cup and other major tennis events, including the Australian Open and the Adelaide International. Adelaide's professional association football team, Adelaide United, play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is Hindmarsh Stadium, which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few purpose-built soccer stadia in Australia. Prior to United's foundation, Adelaide City and West Adelaide represented the city in the National Soccer League. The two sides, which contest the Adelaide derby against one another, now play in the National Premier Leagues South Australia.\nFor two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level rugby league, after the New South Wales Rugby League had played a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval for five years starting in 1991. The Adelaide Rams were formed and played in the breakaway Super League (SL) competition in 1997 before moving to the new National Rugby League in 1998. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to the more suitable Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a peace deal with the Australian Rugby League to end the Super League war, the club's owners News Limited (who were also owners of the SL) suddenly closed the club only weeks before the start of the 1999 season.\nAdelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the Adelaide 36ers which plays in the National Basketball League (NBL) and the women's team, the Adelaide Lightning which plays in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL). Both teams play their home games at the Titanium Security Arena. Adelaide has a professional netball team, the Adelaide Thunderbirds, which plays in the national netball competition, the Suncorp Super Netball championship, with home games played at Priceline Stadium. The Thunderbirds occasionally play games or finals at the Titanium Security Arena, while international netball matches are usually played at the 10,500 seat Adelaide Entertainment Centre. The Titanium Security Arena has a capacity of 8,000 and is the largest purpose-built basketball stadium in Australia.\n\nSince 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas have hosted the Tour Down Under bicycle race, organised and directed by Adelaide-based Michael Turtur. Turtur won an Olympic gold medal for Australia in the 4000m Team pursuit at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and was the first event outside Europe to be granted UCI ProTour status. Adelaide maintains a franchise in the Australian Baseball League, the Adelaide Bite. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium (until 2016) was Norwood Oval. From 2016 the team moved to the Diamond Sports Stadium located near the Adelaide International Airport due to renovations at Norwood. Its name stems from the local Great Australian Bight, and from the abundance of local Great White Sharks. Adelaide also has an Ice Hockey team, Adelaide Adrenaline in the Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL). It was national champions in 2009 and plays its games at the IceArenA.The Australian Grand Prix for World Championship Formula One racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the Adelaide Street Circuit which was laid out in the city's East End as well as the eastern parklands including the Victoria Park Racecourse. The Grand Prix became a source of pride, and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful Clipsal 500 for V8 Supercar racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a rally of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.\nAdelaide formerly had three horse racing venues. Victoria Park, Cheltenham Park Racecourse, both of which have now closed, and Morphettville Racecourse that remains the home of the South Australian Jockey Club. It also has Globe Derby Park for Harness racing that opened in 1969, and by 1973 had become Adelaide's premier harness racing venue taking over from the Wayville Showgrounds, as well as Greyhound Park for greyhound racing that opened in 1972.\nThe World Solar Challenge race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-years' history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide hosted the 2012 World Bowls Championships at Lockleys Bowling Club, becoming the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.\nDirt track speedway is also popular in Adelaide with three operating speedways. Adelaide Motorsport Park, located adjacent to the Adelaide International Raceway road racing circuit at Virginia (24 km (15 mi) north of the city centre) has been in continuous operation since 1979 after the closure of the popular Rowley Park Speedway. Gillman Speedway located in the semi-industrial suburb of Gillman, has been in operation since 1998 and caters to Motorcycle speedway and Sidecars, while the Sidewinders Speedway located in Wingfield is also a motorcycle speedway dedicated to Under-16 riders and has been in operation since 1978. In 2016 backed my South Australia's Peregrine Group owners of OTR (On the run service stations and 24/7-hour convenient stores) opened up a multi-purpose facility; a state-of-the-art motorsporting park and a hotel alongside its newer OTR service station outside a small township of Tailem Bend currently named The Bend Motorsport Park. Design for thrill seekers and rev-heads the facility currently host South Australia's second V8 Supercars motoring event during a round in August and hopes to bring in other major international motoring events such as SBK Superbikes and other well established FIA motoring events.\nAdelaide is home to the Great Southern Slam, the world's largest roller derby tournament.  The tournament has been held biennially over Australia's Queen's Birthday holiday weekend since 2010.  In 2014 and 2016 the tournament featured 45 teams playing in two divisions.  In 2018 the tournament has expanded to 48 teams competing in three divisions.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBeing centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east\u2013west and north\u2013south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan public transport system managed by and known as the Adelaide Metro. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the O-Bahn Busway, 6 commuter rail lines (diesel and electric), and a small tram network operating between inner suburb Hindmarsh, the city centre, and seaside Glenelg. Tramways were largely dismantled in the 1950s, but saw a revival in the 2010s with upgrades and extensions. A proposal to significantly extend the tram network called AdeLINK is dormant following a change of state government.Road transport in Adelaide has historically been easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Adelaide was known as a \"twenty-minute city\", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, such arterial roads often experience traffic congestion as the city grows.\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:\n\nThe South Eastern Freeway (M1), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to Murray Bridge and Tailem Bend, where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.\nThe Southern Expressway (M2), connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of South Road.\nThe North-South Motorway (M2), is an ongoing major project that will become the major north\u2013south corridor, replacing most of what is now South Road, connecting the Southern Expressway and the Northern Expressway via an motorway with no traffic lights. As of 2020 the motorway's northern half is complete (save for a small link under construction at Croydon Park), connecting the Northern Expressway to Adelaide's inner north-west; the section running through Adelaide's inner west and inner south-west is awaiting funding.\nThe Port River Expressway (A9), connects Port Adelaide and Outer Harbor to Port Wakefield Road at the northern \"entrance\" to the metropolitan area.\nThe Northern Expressway (Max Fatchen Expressway) (M2), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the Gawler Bypass to Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, Adelaide International Airport and Parafield Airport. Adelaide Airport, in Adelaide's south-western suburbs, serves in excess of 8 million passengers annually. Parafield Airport, Adelaide's second airport 18 kilometres (11 miles) north of the city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes. Parafield Airport served as Adelaide's main aerodrome until the opening of the Adelaide Airport in February 1955. Adelaide airport serves many international and domestic destinations including all Australian state capitals.\nAdelaide is also home to a military airport, known as Edinburgh Airport, located in the northern suburbs. It was built in 1955 in a joint initiative with the UK for weapon development.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAdelaide's two largest hospitals are the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) in the city centre, a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Adelaide (800 beds), and the Flinders Medical Centre (580 beds) in Bedford Park, affiliated with Flinders University. The RAH also operates additional campuses for specialist care throughout the suburbs including the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre (150 beds) in Northfield and the Glenside Campus (129 beds) for acute mental health services. Other major public hospitals are the Women's and Children's Hospital (305 beds), in North Adelaide; the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (340 beds) in Woodville; Modbury Hospital (178 beds) in Modbury; and the Lyell McEwin Hospital (198 beds) in Elizabeth. Numerous private hospitals are also located throughout the city, with the largest operators being not-for-profits Adelaide Community Healthcare Alliance (3 hospitals) and Calvary Care (4 hospitals).\nIn 2017, the RAH was relocated from the city's East End to a new AU$2.3 billion facility built over former railyards in the West End. The state-of-the-art hospital forms part of a new biomedical precinct called BioMed City that colocates the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), the University of Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences building, the University of South Australia's Health Innovation Building, and the state's Dental Hospital. SAHMRI is building a $300 million second facility due to be completed by 2022 to house the Australian Bragg Centre with Australia's first proton therapy unit. There are also plans for the Women's and Children's Hospital to be relocated to the precinct adjacent the RAH by 2024.\n\nThe largest provider of community health care within Adelaide is the not-for-profit Royal District Nursing Service (RDNS), which provides out of hospital care and hospital avoidance care.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nAdelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the Adelaide Electric Supply Company, which was nationalised by the Playford government in 1946, becoming the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA). Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the Olsen Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network (ETSA Utilities, later renamed SA Power Networks) and the outright purchase of ETSA Power by the Cheung Kong Holdings for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP Trevor Crothers resigned from the party and voted with the government.The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year. In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation. In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012. South Australia has the highest retail price for electricity in the country.Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Electricity generation comes from a range of technologies and operators. ElectraNet operates the high-voltage electricity transmission network. SA Power Networks distributes electricity to end users. The largest electricity and gas retailing companies are also the largest generating companies.\nThe largest fossil fuel power stations are the Torrens Island Power Station gas-fired plant operated by AGL Energy and the Pelican Point Power Station operated by Engie. South Australia also has wind and solar power and connections to the national grid. Gas is supplied from the Moomba Gas Processing Plant in the Cooper Basin via the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System and the SEAGas pipeline from Victoria.\nIn 2011, South Australia generated 18% of its electricity from wind power, and had 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.Due to almost universal blackouts within the city during September 2016, the state worked with Tesla to produce the world's largest electricity battery at Hornsdale Power Reserve which has increased that state's electrical security to the extent in which large blackouts are no longer an event.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nThe provision of water services is by the government-owned SA Water. Adelaide's water is supplied from its seven reservoirs: Mount Bold, Happy Valley, Myponga, Millbrook, Hope Valley, Little Para and South Para. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements (90GL per annum) in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the River Murray.A sea-water desalination plant capable of supplying 100GL per annum was built during the 2001\u20132009 drought; however, it operated at about 8% of its capacity until 2019. In December 2018, the State and Federal Governments agreed to fund a $2m study to determine how the plant could be used to reduce reliance on river water, in an effort to help save the Murray River basin and mouth (including the Coorong) from further ecological damage.\n\n\n=== Communications ===\nAdelaideFree WiFi is a citywide free WiFi network covering most of the inner city areas of Adelaide, primarily the Adelaide CBD and Northern Adelaide precincts. It was officially launched at the Adelaide Central Markets on Tuesday 25 June 2014. It is provided by Internode, with infrastructure provided by outdoor Cisco WiFi N access points attached to the top of lighting poles, as well as inside cafes and businesses across the city.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAdelaide city centre includes chart of major streets and squares, street widths, and town acres\nAdelaide Hills\nCity of Adelaide\nMusic of Adelaide\nPort AdelaideListsImages of Adelaide\nList of Adelaide obsolete suburb names\nList of Adelaide parks and gardens\nList of Adelaide railway stations\nList of Adelaide suburbs\nList of films shot in Adelaide\nList of people from Adelaide\nList of protected areas in Adelaide\nList of public art in South Australia\nList of public transport routes in Adelaide\nList of South Australian commercial icons\nList of sporting clubs in Adelaide\nList of tallest buildings in Adelaide\nSister cities of the City of Adelaide (the Local government area that governs the city centre)\nTourist attractions in South Australia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAdelaide City Council > Official City Guide\nAdelaide City Council\nKids in Adelaide Retrieved 12 May 2020.",

          "Lived and vacationed in Adelaide for years and finally stumpled across the Gaol. It's a fascinating place. There is a ton of history, a lot of it unexpected. Not for everyone but for those liking such a thing, a great treat",
          "We visited the gaol during the day.Very interesting place full of history.The staff are very informative and friendly. They have a good souvenir shop.",
          "Spent a good few hours here, it was so interesting. The lady at the front desk talked us through a map and was very helpful. The cells and all the readings were so well laid out and the history is fascinating. At the end th3 lady at the desk told us a few more facts which were",
          "How about staying in a Gaol that was built in the 1840's. Wonder around the graveyard where the bodies of the prisoners were buried. There are 4 different tours you can take: 2hour ghost at night ($44). 4 hour ghost at night ($80). All night lockin's 9pm till 4am $125. 2hour",
          "Catch the tram to the nearest stop and brisk walk later you have arrived for an interesting look at past and recent history A few cells set to show furniture, models lounging showing the boredom, would be a good visual addition but plenty to explore and learn. No Cafe available",
          "I took the self guided tour. You are given a map when you pay your admission. There are lots of things to see and read. I enjoyed my visit there. This gaol was still in operation until the 80's. This is well worth the visit. The gaol is not far from ath CBD. You can get",
          "We enjoyed our visit. The kids liked their Mystery trail and it allowed them to interact with the history and explore all aspects of the jail.",
          "Very interesting place to visit - but we found it a little difficult to get to, not knowing the area. An historic gaol with a past, but still used up until the 1980's, so there are 'improvements' to show how things changed over the years - or did they? We did the self-guided",
          "Building looks exactly what you would expect an old gaol to look like! Friendly service at reception and the woman explained a wee bit about the history of the gaol. An easy self guided tour - the map is all you need to navigate around. Very interesting place to spend a couple",
          "Came here on Sunday morning at opening. The lady on the till was very friendly and explained a little bit of the history of the prison and gave us a map with a route to follow. An amazing piece of history for SA and Adelaide and well worth the visit. Walking through really",
          "The Adelaide Gaol is a very interesting historic site to visit made all the more interesting by the fact that the place was an operating gaol until the 1980\u2019s. I went on a self guided tour with a map to follow and found that you could really get a feel of what the place would",
          "I went to the Gaol on Sunday afternoon and was fortunate to have a personal guided tour with Helen. She certainly knew all about the gaol and the former inmates. Thanks Helen for a great afternoon.",
          "Came here on a rainy mid week day and happily filled in a few hours taking ourselves through the grounds. We were literally the only visitors so used the supplied map which clearly shows the path to take to see everything. Enough sign boards without needing to spend hours",
          "Good value for money did a self guided tour spent 2 hours exploring site. Staff member at reception gave a good run down how to do the self guided tour. Found the history of the goal to be very interesting I highly recommended a visit",
          "Lived here for nearly 15 years, seen it from outside and always meant to, but never got to in. Until now!!! We took our friends and their young kids to see it, family pass offers 2 x adults & 2 x kids for around $35 AUD. Our tour was self guiding but I understand there is a",
          "We stopped by here on a Sunday morning close to opening, without having high expectations. We were pleasantly surprised by the whole experience and were glad that we made the trip. There was a passionate volunteer working when we were there that gave us an intro to the gaol",
          "Melbourne has more history and long past, but Adelaide goal is more hands on. Your people are very good at telling story about scary history and set atmosphere.",
          "So enjoyed the visit to the Adelaide Gaol with 3 grandkids ages 9 & 10 in July 2019. There was a puzzle that required clues to be followed to find the code to be \"released\" from Gaol and all joined in to find the way out. We were most impressed with the way it was organised",
          "The Adelaide Gaol Escape Trail was run in the July School Holidays, I think yearly, it was mentioned it was the 3rd one. Great for adults and kids alike with a map and a series of places to find. it takes you to all areas throughout the gaol so no place is missed when",
          "Really enjoyed this experience. Was informative and enlightening. Kids of all ages enjoy this experience. Certainly eerie at times but what a fantastic way to experience history.",
          "A beautifully built Gaol with such an interesting history! It is all on 1 level, with lots of information as you go around, you get a map which guides you around so you get to see everything. The tower where they did the last executions was a little creepy (when you are the only",
          "Wow, was quite amazed at this beautiful old jail, very interesting to read all the plaques along the back wall of executed prisoners crimes. Worth a visit if you have few hours to spare.",
          "The Gaol is open at 10am-4pm. We paid $12.50 for concession each. We were given a map of the jail and a 3 min chat and off we went. We took 2 and a half hours walking (easy walk, all on the one level). The Gaol had loads of history, really interesting, the map was easy to follow",
          "Visited for the open day during History Month. Admission was discounted to $5 for the day. Adelaide Gaol is one of my favourite museum places to visit. There's so much history and since it only closed in the 80s there plenty of items were left behind after it closed, making it",
          "This is a $5.00 entrance fee which has to be one of the best value tours around. The history is amazing and all the persons hanged are buried in the gaol itself. There are volunteers to assist and prove a great history lesson. We spent about and hour and a half here and our son",
          "Definitely worth a visit! For $14.50 it\u2019s reasonably priced. You get given an umbrella just in case and a map with a route to follow. Really accessible for everyone. Lots to look at and read without being too overwhelming. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s haunted. I could have sworn I heard this",
          "It was a good experience to see how people were treated and criminals were held for there time in the gaol. Definitely a visit for anyone who like the history of the city.",
          "I have visited and investigated the Old Adelaide Gaol many times. My favourite times have been with the Adelaide Gaol Preservation Society who have helped preserve this iconic location over the past 30+ years, giving their time and money back to gaol, rather than taking it for",
          "We took our grandchildren aged 5 and 7years and they had a brilliant morning. The staff seemed to go out of their way to be helpful and welcoming. They engaged the children with the 'Gaol break' activity and the hunt for clues set had the children engrossed and enthusiastic.",
          "We did a self guided tour through the gaol with the jail break activity for a bit of fun. Having closed its doors in 1988, the gaol in some areas (eg the store) is a time capsule of days past. While the displays demonstrate the conditions and stories of the prisoners throughout",
          "I did the self guided tour, and it was amazing! It was really creepy, even though we went during the day. I was too scared to do the ghost tour. There is a lot of history there, and you can feel it as you walk through. I was shocked to learn it was still open till 40 years ago.",
          "My son loves learning about history and has a fascination with old buildings. The Adelaide Gaol did not let him down. We entered and were greeted by the extremely personable staff at reception and then we began the children\u2019s exploration and Gaol escape. This gave ya the",
          "We did our own tour on an extremely hot day, make sure you have water with you. As a family we found the gaol a fascinatingly, compelling place to visit. The conditions and rules the inmates endured was unbelievable. Quite a few who were executed have been interred within the",
          "This was only closed in the 1980's so it almost feels like a recently working gaol! Some of the stories of the inmates and \"hanging tower\" are pretty spooky, and the place certainly has a rather dour atmosphere (especially on the drizzly day we visited) but its an interesting",
          "For access by private vehicle there is free parking adjacent to the gaol, otherwise it is around a 10 minute walk from the nearest bus stop. There are picnic facilities in the grounds and a small selection of snacks is sold at the entry counter. For those with mobility",
          "While interesting, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like this wasn\u2019t as impressive as the other prison museums I\u2019ve seen in other Australian cities.",
          "We spent two hours there on a Sunday afternoon. Umbrellas were provided as we walked around the prison. Lots of information about the prison, inmates and executions. Would have loved an audio tour but bearing in mind it closed in the early 1980s it\u2019s almost unreal prisoners were",
          "Full of fascinating history from what was comparatively recently a working prison. See the cells used. See also where executions occurred and prisoners were buried. There are lots of artifacts on display. Well worth a visit.",
          "My sister bought us a tour for my husbands birthday We went along thinking that we were getting a ghost tour. It is not a host tour is it is booked by the society. It is just a guided night tour A couple of comments was made about seeing something but was brushed aside very",
          "Staff were very helpful. Exhibits very good. Some items were difficult to read in the dark. Parking was free and plentiful. Thank you for a great visit.",
          "Went with my teenage boys yesterday we took about two hours to see everything. It was so interesting and fun to explore. My two boys don\u2019t like many things but they loved this and enjoyed the history.",
          "Spent about 3 hours here exploring all of the gaol and it was so interesting. Loved learning the history of the gaol.",
          "We walked to the Adelaide Gaol. The clerk was nice and she gave instructions how to visit the gaol. This prison had murderers, thieves, armed robbers and embezzlers. There was poor sanitation in that prison. There were rats, insects and harsh conditions. There were lots of",
          "The early Australian history here is great, the map from the front counter was clear in detail and easy to follow. Would work well for kids to see how crime and penalty has evolved. Some great photos around the towers also.",
          "My son (12) and I took the self guided tour and really enjoyed it. The museum had some really interesting features and sights to see. I think the museum has got the balance of its presentation just right; there has been some reconstruction, but not so much that you lose the feel",
          "We stopped by the Gaol today and did the self guided tour. It is so informative and we both loved learning all about the place and some of the prisoners. Highly recommend!!! We spent about 3 hours there and it was really affordable.",
          "Awesome place to visit can\u2019t recommend highly enough!! Going back soon to do ghost tour. Friendly staff and they are more than happy to help!!",
          "A group of work friends completed a ghost \ud83d\udc7b tour of the gaol What a great experience it was with lots of facts and stories to be told Recommend for sure.",
          "I did the self-tour, and I have a fascination with prisons as I study them. Would potentially been a better experience if I'd gone with someone else, or had done the ghost tour, but it was a cheap and decent thing to do when by oneself. Lots of information, with an interactive",
          "Still can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only been closed less than 30 years. Lots of info to read. Lady in shop very helpful gave us sun umbrellas and a water spay to keep cooler as it was hot. My daughter had just as much fun with these as she did learning about the inmates there.",
          "We did the night ghost tour on a week night. It does kick off on time so do not be late. Actors dress up and play out how it was back then. We didn't feel or sense any spirits and being night time, people are already sensitive. It was an interesting tour and does highlight how",
          "Colleen at the front counter was lovely and friendly. Very helpful and full of knowledge. The jail itself is quite interesting and well maintained.",
          "Interesting insights into a slice of life we hope never to see. Sad, uncomfortable and fascinating. We caught the free tram, got off at the Cocacola factory and walked through Bonython park and past the police horse paddocks to get there - which was charming. Self led tour -",
          "Our visit was a sunny afternoon but the goosebumps were definitely prominent for most of the tour. It was very interesting and very informative. The information boards and props were great. You didn\u2019t want to be left in any room by yourself though.",
          "This was a great day out, we thought it would be busy as it was a Saturday but we had almost the entire place to ourselves. It was really interesting learning about the history and inmates which they had. If you have a few hours spare I would recommend going!",
          "We did the self-guided tour (reasonably priced at $14.50 for an adult) and enjoyed this historical attraction very much.",
          "This is of interest but the South Australian Government have let it fall into disrepair. With a little money spent on it, it could be good",
          "I visited with my 10-year old son. We used the Kids Photo Trail book (part of Children's University program) to self-guide, however this is the same as the general self-guided tour. This institution was brutal and antiquated, and the opportunity to visit and walk through was",
          "Fantastic place with so much history over a long period of time, went on a self guided tour provided with a map and a lot of information upon entering the goal. Teens loved it too.. easy to walk Around my mother in law was with us in a wheel chair and was able to easily access",
          "Did the evening ghost walk, with a guide, who revealed the history of the jail. Very atmospheric inside. Scary in places! Very informative though, about how a jail changed through the age's. I found the hanging tower and the graves made me stop and think about what it must have",
          "Well organised and loads of interesting stories. follow the trail, get the kids involved in the hunt for ex residents, take your time tread about how the prison was a major part of the history of the State. don't miss it. We have been three times and always find something new",
          "A must see place when visiting Adelaide because its living history right there in front of you. Often old prisons are partially demolished or stripped bare and you have to use some imagination to get the \"feel\" for the place. But here in Adelaide you could almost hear the doors",
          "I have memories of riding past this prison as a child, on a train with my family, to go into town. As we passed by, their would be some prisoners in the vegie gardens and we would wave to them. Some 40 odd years later, we decided it was time for a look around. What a shock to",
          "I visited this relic of days gone by when incarceration was considered the correct form of punishment. Yes, it is stark but one must remember the penalty need fit the crime. It was here that the murderer of a close friend had his life terminated and I felt a need for closure. I",
          "We walked from town to visit the old Gaol and associated museum. 9.5 $ oz to get in per adult. Good wander around the rooms and cells. Good history panels and some interesting tales of inmates and their crimes. Hard to believe that it was a working prison until recent times.",
          "You simply must visit this iconic landmark in South Australia's history. The construction of this gaol almost financially crippled the SA economy during the mid 1800s. The gaol operated between 1841 and 1988 and the conditions were brutal. Highlights include the gruesome",
          "Had a lovely day visiting the Adelaide Gaol. We always love to visit old gaols and penitentiaries on our holidays, and thought we should check out one in our town. A little disappointing that it was a self-guided tour, with not even an option to purchase a head set to help you",
          "I partook in the night ghost tour that was guided and took place for two hours. It was really interesting, informative and was hosted really well. I would highly recommend this as something to do if you're in the area, but would point out the one downfall was how much people",
          "Visited Adelaide Goal as a couple July 2017. My husband had always wanted to go but I was surprised at how interesting I found it. The lady that greeted us was very warm and welcoming. She gave us a map, a brief history of the goal, some interesting facts and pointed out points",
          "I visited the during the morning. The staff provided a map and a brief overview that was sufficient to sell all the highlights. 66 inmates were hanged there and over 300000 people were interred - many for shorter periods. Whilst the displays were interesting I wished I has the",
          "Very very cold and very dark. Wrap yourself up in the warmest clothes you have, including gloves and beanie, and make sure u have plenty of camera battery to use your own torch. For even more comfort, take a small fold up seat so you can sit down when they stop for lengthy",
          "We went here not expecting much. We were wrong! You get chance to see how/where the prisoners lived and you can see the gallows too. Outside, the prisoners who were put to death there are buried in the grounds. You can visit each 'grave' and read why they were put to death. All",
          "Attended the recent Open Day which offered $5 entry per person. My youngest was hoping to connect with one of its ghosts, but alas, that did not happen. Unfortunately it was all self-guided, so we weren't privy to any juicy or scary stories to enhance our tour. It was a little",
          "Sad place Eerie to think of all the horribleness that went on there...but that's life! I like the dig they have done in which they've uncovered some different foundations. Reasonable prices The 1 Staff member was friendly For some time to kill it's a good 2 hours out of your",
          "We wasted our time walking out there. It was closed for a private function. This is supposedly one of the top 10 things to do in Adelaide and they close it for a private party ??????",
          "We went with a community group, wonderful guided walking tour, of Adelaide's not so pleasant past. The buildings and surrounds have and are still being preserved, along with artworks done by prisoners, tools of trade of prisoners, guards, wardens, doctors and dentist rooms.",
          "I've lived in Sa all my life and today I decided to do a self guided tour. The lady at the gate was very helpful. The map was great, a great little creepy place if your into all things haunted and historical. The gift shop was fun too.",
          "We went twice, once on a night ghost tiur & then again during the day. The ghost tour was a guilded tour that went for 2 hours. The self guilded tour during the day took us about 2 hours. Very interesting and gift shop was very resonable as were the admissions fees.",
          "It is a bit hard to know how to review this - the self guided tour was full of interesting information, but it is also a heavy sort of topic. It kept my kids interested, with plenty of cells to walk into, try out a non-contact visit and a good look at the Hanging Tower (which",
          "Very impressive facility very close to the city. It's hard to believe this facility was still in use until 1988 when you see how basic the facilities are. Do the self guided tour, you're given a map after paying your entry fee and it's very easy to navigate around. Allow 2",
          "Tours are self guided and the whole experience is somewhat underwhelming. Unless you are really into prisons, I would not bother visiting.",
          "It is hard to believe that this prison only closed in 1988. The facilities are, at the very least, basic, so the time fitting the crime must have quite an ordeal. We did the self-guided tour, which is very easy as the map is clear and easy to follow. There is a small shop",
          "This is a really interesting attraction, which seems be missing from the tourist trail. When we visited there were only a handful of people there, although we understand it is busier at weekends and with school visits. The Gaol is virtually untouched since the last inmates left",
          "This prison, which was in operation until the 1980s is located close to downtown Adelaide. Open in the early 1800s, this is not a happy place. About 40-something people have been executed here, by hanging, and their graves here are marked well. This is a somber but very",
          "This gaol is raw and seems to have changed little since it was used, which is how you want to see an exhibition like this. We did a self guided tour, which allowed us time to wander around and take in the depressing climate of a penal institution that was in use until",
          "Was not sure what to expect from visting the Old Adelaide Gaol. Whilst it contains a morbid history, it was far more interesting than I expected and I enjoyed it more than other similar sites I had previously been to. The location is slightly out of walking distance from the",
          "During its lifetime the Gaol housed over 300,000 inmates and executed 45 of them, all of whom are buried within the prison walls. It is a foreboding building full of atmosphere, but not a nice one.",
          "You would need to be interested in the penal system and the conditions prisoners lived in to appreciate this place. We went there thinking it was \u2018old\u2019 as in it had not been used recently, but then found out the last prisoners were there in 1984. There is quite an emphasis on",
          "For a small entrance fee, wander round the Old Adelaide Goal. Lots of historic information and old photos. Experience life in goal in the last century. Some areas still being restored but it is absolutely fascinating. A gift shop also on site. This is a brilliant attraction.",
          "Excellent venue with loads of character. Goal cells and graves in wall were a bit unsettling. caterers did a great job, nice and central easy to get to",
          "The old Adelaide Gaol had very few people visiting the day we attended. It's not a sophisticated 'tourist' place, as it shouldn't be. Just to walk through the cells and the grounds gave you a real idea of the deprivation and loneliness the inmates would have felt. And to think",
          "I've actually been here twice and one occasion I stayed the night (about ten years ago) and did the midnight tour whilst staying in the old hospital ward, original beds and all! I can't recommend going more, it's fascinating, time will stand still! Weather you're a tourist or a",
          "I was amazed at how few people there were at the gaol this afternoon. This experience was certainly worth the entry fee and a lot more. A great insight into the conditions that the prisoners endured in the early part of the colonial Adelaide settlement and the influence many of",
          "A fascinating place with lots of history. At night it is really mind blowing, especially if you do an Adelaide's Haunted Horizons Ghost Tour here.",
          "A visit here is certainly worth it. It is very walk-able if you are in the city centre. The jail or gaol is almost the way it was when it was closed. A lot of it is not maintained so it has the creepy decrepit air. We went on a self guided tour which was very good. There are",
          "Great venue for a concert in open air between the gaol walls. Best in reasonable weather. Plenty of good parking, opportunity to visit the cells, and casual food and wine available to enjoy for an hour or two before the event. Good acoustics, and good venue for a variety of",
          "If you're like us in that you enjoy visiting museums and landmarks of historical significance, then you''ll enjoy the old adelaide goal. It was intersting to wander through, reading of the history stories behind both the building as well as the inmates. Wish there were some",
          "Whilst looking for things to do in the city, we stumbled across this little gem. We got the tram from Adelaide railway station to west terrace, and the Gaol was only about a 10 minute walk. The staff member who served us was very friendly and informative. We were given a map so",
          "Well worth a visit. Lots to see. Hanging tower very grim as you would expect. Quite spooky and creepy walking around some of the corridors.",
          "If you like your dark history, or walking tours, add this to your list. Thoroughly entertaining look into the (relatively recent) past.",
          "A very informative and interesting place to visit to see the place and methods of punishment used from the earliest days of the area to current times when the prison was closed. Staffed by volunteers all of whom were very friendly and helpful.",
          "Went to the Gaol a few weeks ago while visiting my brother who lives in Adelaide, he and his wife went with me as they had never visited before. I have to say I found it fascinating and on a par with Robin Island and Alcatraz both of which I have visited. The prison was a",
          "This was a great experience at a low cost although somewhat out of the way. It was recently used until the 1980s but looks like a convict era building. Its history is displayed through signs and could be better displayed with lifelike models but still worth a visit.",
          "The place is not far from the city, it is quite big area, you need 2 hours to look around and read the story. some place have the mannequin, a bit scary.",
          "I booked my tour through the Adelaide Gaol Preservation Society. All tour guides are volunteers and very professional. We had a guide named Tennille, she knew so much about the history of the gaol as well as its ghosts. Great experience although we didn't see an actual ghosts.",
          "We took a self guided tour and the family had a lot of fun. It is both interesting and a little scary to see how prisoners were kept over the years. The interactive/display section was good fun and caught the kids attention. Areas of the jail are run down but I guess you have",
          "Self guided tour of the goal. Very interesting with good displays in the museum area. Keen photographers will enjoy the photographic opportunities. Hard to believe the goal only closed in 1988 as it is a very old goal and quite primitive. We would have loved a guided tour as",
          "We visited the Adelaide Gaol on a ghost tour and we were not disappointed. Whether you believe in ghosts or not, the stories of those who do, and have had an encounter at the gaol, are worth a listen. We came away with a good historical understanding and a bit of a chill. A very",
          "We done the ghost tour @ the goal very informative & had a great night. Didn't see any ghosts but a lot of history even thou it's it closed in the 80's if i recall highly recommend if your looking for a good night out.",
          "The Old Adelaide Gaol is full of history and intrigue. While it's creepy seeing the burial plots of executed prisoners, it's also interesting reading about their crimes. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and for $14 entry, it's good value for money.",
          "A glimpse into the terrible world of prisoners and the prison system. I can still remember when this was an operating prison and waving to the prisoners working in the garden, from the train. We were looking for something different to do with the kids and didn't regret coming",
          "it was so nice to explore the gaol on self guided tour. full of history and lots of signs to let you know about everything. pretty creepy and the fact it ran up to 1987 was hard to imagine. definitely the way prisoners should even be kept nowadays. was really cool seeing the",
          "Make the effort to visit Adelaide Gaol. An extremely interesting tourism attraction detailing the history of the gaol and its residents. Be careful when exploring the New Building....",
          "Run by volunteers it is well worth a visit. It rivals the Melbourne goal . As it was used until recent times it is still generally in tact. You can take a guided tour or wander on your own. The guided tour is well worth the money to get the real stories. The volunteers are very",
          "A great insight into the workings and machinations of a system and a time far long since past. Penny was a great guide who took us through the gaol for 1 1/2 hours talking about the life and times of prisoners of the goal. Ghost stories abound.",
          "This was a pretty low key visit. We could read all about the gaol but then we're on our own to tour the facility. There was information all around, some of it very sad. Seems to have had compassionate governors and on the whole not nearly as awful as some other goals I have",
          "Fantastic view of South Australian History. Interesting, informative and yes a little creepy. Suggest reading at all the opportunities presented so allow longer than what is recommended and you'll enjoy even more of the visit.",
          "Caught the free train the West Terrace, approx. min walk to attraction. Reasonable price and a number of interesting facts are posted throughout the Gaol. Self directed tour.",
          "Enjoyed learning the history of the goal. We found that some areas could have benefit from additional signage detailing the area/artifacts, though overall we had a nice time wandering around here. When we visited it was raining and we found that a number of areas where outside",
          "Have been meaning to visit the gaol for a long time, having a relative over from Tassie gave us a great excuse to do the tourist thing. On arrival easy parking, cost of the tour was quite inexpensive. We had a map and did our own self-guided tour. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit",
          "We visited on a cold day, so that added to the sense of misery that would have been imposed on the inmates. A worthwhile visit and under normal circumstances, quite reasonably priced. On the day that we visited, a part of the gaol was closed to the public due to a private",
          "Very interesting historical site my wife enjoyed it immensely she is into touring old jails and seeing how the women were treated",
          "A walk around this historic Gaol is so worth the time and money. Not expensive. Full of history and as it closed in the 1960s it shows how prison life was for the inmates. It is quite a cold place in winter so take jackets. They do supply umbrellas if it is raining. Self guided",
          "We visited with our 3 year old son and although he was too young to understand he had fun running around the grounds while my husband and I were able to read the information in the exhibits. It could benefit from more signage and some updating, but overall it was interesting and",
          "Visited here today well worth a visit fascinating look at S.A history good value for money. Absolutely would bring more interstate visitors here again",
          "Penny and Rob were our husband and wife hosts on our night time tour of the Gaol. It's a cracker of a tour with some stories that will absolutely make you crap yourself when you visit the gaol with the highest levels of paranormal activity in Australia. I am not a huge believer",
          "One of Adelaide's oldest buildings which is full of history and a must see when visiting. We opted for the self guided tour which was really interesting to read and take our time to explore this site and a huge credit to SA Parks for the amount of interp sigange and displays on",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and spent about 2 hours exploring the gaol. There is an entry fee of $14 per person for your own self guided tour, but you are supplied a map and interesting information in regards to important sites and burials on the grounds. It was a cooler,",
          "Adelaide Goal is an awkward visit - mainly because it used 'til the late 80's so the place is a mix of old and modern facilities. But if you love jails - this is still a must visit. SA is not a place for horrific crimes or punishment but it shows you an interesting side of",
          "Was a great place to visit and to explore really interesting and to have some graffiti on the cell doors from past inmates was quite awesome to see. Well worth a look",
          "We ended up staying at 120 North Terrace in Adelaide and picking up some tourist info on this gaol in our hotel. I love going to old gaols and this one did not disappoint. It was just a nice 1/2 hour walk from our hotel, past the new hospital being built. There was an entrance",
          "We visited on a Sunday for a self-guided tour ($14). The gaol has an incredible history and the buildings are very interesting. The leaflet you are given has a great map with all appropriate sights listed and also a history of the executions that took place at the gaol. There",
          "The Adelaide Gaol is a great tourist attraction that you forget is in the very heart of the City and the night time Ghost Tour is well worth the visit if you like a spooky atmosphere ! The Gaol itself is very interesting and in good condition considering the age of the",
          "The tour was very well run . The guide was very polite and friendly ,he was very clear to say that we might or might not have ghostly experiance. The guide was very informative about the jails history and was happy to answer any questions.the jail has some lovely architectural",
          "We had a great visit to the Adelaide Gaol. It wasn't too busy and the volunteers dressed in period costume added drama to the tour. We followed the map and meandered our way through the different sections, we were there about 3 hours. I think a hire service of guided tour",
          "We very much enjoyed our self guided tour through the gaol. There are plenty of information bays around the gaol to give you an insight into each area.",
          "Our group aged from 22 to 72 did not enjoy the ghost tour at all. It dragged on and we found it more funny than eerie - and they had a full moon to work with on the night we were there! As tourists we got a bus as close as we could and then had a good walk to get there.",
          "Visited for the first Blues festival, great venue and well managed and organised. Easy to access with adequate parking and good facilities and catering for this event anyway. The historic part of the building is well worth a visit and well laid out",
          "great place to see old buildings and the way the colony grew, gives a great memory of the prison system check out the new building !!! and keep an eye out for the local ghosts, yes ghosts more than 1 !!!",
          "Hard to believe that this facility was still being used in 1988. Very grim, a real eye opener. If you have a couple of hours to spare the Gaol is well worth a visit.",
          "Plenty to see. Might be better with a guide to go around. The old gaol and the new one not much different. Showed what a hard life they had especially for small crimes when they were starving.",
          "this is a must see for anyone interested in history, the self guided tour is very informative and it's one of the few places we have visited where you can have a hands on experience (lock picking kept us entertained for ages). interesting displays from opening in 1841 to its",
          "A great example of an early Australian gaol. Unspoiled by gimmicks and false props. Gritty. The gaol has a raw quality that gives you the sense of desperation and isolation the prisoners would have experienced. Prisoners graves between the walls of the prison. Two hanging sites",
          "What a little gem in Adelaide. Excellent piece of history with access to most areas in original state. The gaol is well mapped & signed with interesting stories of the prisoners & times past. It was a shame that guided tours are not offered unless we paid an extra $30. As",
          "I found this neat, the stories, the eeriness from just walking around. I don't think it gets very busy as a tourist attraction since its ran by volunteers but thats no problem, it made walking around even more spooky. The price was very reasonable, I believe $15-20 for the day.",
          "The first Gaol Blues Festival was held at the Adelaide Gaol yesterday March 20th 2016. What a fantastic venue for such a fantastic festival. The admission to the festival also gave everyone access to the historic Adelaide Gaol. Armed with a map of the gaol we were sent forth to",
          "A friend and I took the 8.30pm tour (12/3/16) and absolutely loved it. Our tour guide was well versed in the history which made the 2.5 hours whiz by. Loved the feel of the old place, so much so, we are going back for a lock-in, so that we can spend more time using the",
          "Good balance of history & ghosts of the Old Adelaide Gaol. Our Adelaide Gaol ghost tour had a good balance of Gaol history & the spirits who occupy the gaol. Our guide had an in-depth knowledge of both of these aspects. Our tour also provided an introduction to the paranormal",
          "came to the gaol with my brother as we were looking for something to do, very glad we did, really great history and a lot of really interesting information about the gaol and the prisoners, great thing to do if you have some time to spear in Adelaide, the story's are great to",
          "You should have this as an option only if you are staying several days in Adelaide and you went to all the other places.",
          "The goal was somewhat difficult to find as we walked along the towpath whereas it would have been easier to go along the main road. Fascinating and macabre!",
          "Take your time to walk around this jail and lsdten to and read the stories You are able to enter a number of cells .The displays are good and tell us a lot about the cruelty of the not so distant past",
          "We found the Adeliade goal to be very interesting. Many stories about inmates to make you shiver. Recommend for family",
          "Went for a Ghost Tour which was good, tour leader was new I think and a bit nervous but the tour was still interesting from a historical perspective. Wish we'd had more time to come back and see the place in the day.",
          "Very interesting place this Adelaide Gaol. We enjoyed walking around and reading about life behind bars. I enjoyed being able to go into the cells and have a look. The displays are great, so informative. Cool learning more about Adelaide's history. I would recommend checking",
          "We went on self guide tour we are locals in our 50's and we thought that we would start looking at some local attraction, this is quite an eye opener of life & times of prisoners & prison wardens ,there was certainly some tough times in the gaol on both sides of the law,this was",
          "I have been here a couple of times, both on a self guided day tour and also with Adelaide Haunted Horizons on one of their numerous tours on offer. Both tours were brilliant. If you're a believer in the Paranormal, or even if you just want a fun time with friends, I recommend",
          "this place takes you back and makes you ponder about what people went through,,, this place is haunted also with night tours available. truly unique experience,",
          "Had the guided tour. It was interesting, but nothing special. Expensive for what you got out of it. The Port Arthur prison in Hobart was much more interesting. There are better ways to spend your time in Adelaide. Kids might like it.",
          "I\u2019ve passed by the gaol many times on my way to/from the city. I\u2019ve also seen its inside on a TV programme. Then, I had a chance to visit it with my friends, who were staying at a hotel nearby. We went early in the morning in order to avoid the heat of the day. But",
          "great experience taking the kids to show them how hard the prisoners had back then, great old things to look at. friendly people at the front desk. place has been kept very well preserved",
          "This is the gaol that wasn't supposed to be needed. The place closed in 1988 as a working jail, as it was out of date with health regulations. The whole story of this very early building in Adelaide is a fascinating one to say the least.",
          "The set tour option was about $14 each and we spent a few hours there wandering the different buildings - some interesting history and good access to most parts of the old jail.",
          "We went on the evening ghost tour recently. The history of the gaol was fascinating, but the spookiest thing we experienced was a possum running along the wall towards the end of the tour. The guides were very helpful and fairly knowledgeable, but if I had my time over I would",
          "I did a ghost tour here several years ago (prior to feb 2015 which wasn't an option in the 'when did you visit' required field below). Very spooky and have 2 very strange photographs taken that evening. One with definate orbs and the other very hard to describe, but very creepy",
          "It was good to see around the gaol, particularly at night. The 2 tour guides were very knowledgeable & interacted well with the group. No ghosts or strange experiences happened on this tour, maybe next time.",
          "Self guided tour through the old gaol gave an interesting insight into Adelaide's criminal history and those incarcerated within it's walls.",
          "We visited this attreaction on a very hot day but when we entered the gaol the cold atmosphere was intimidating. The ladies at the entrance were very pleasant and helpfull but we toured the gaol on our own and I was glad the others were there because I found it very scary. It",
          "Husband and wife travelling to Adelaide for a week or so ... a break from the kids , time to see some Aussie sights ,,,,this one is pretty impressive ... a virtual museum and history lesson together ; well presented as a tourist destination; well laid. out with informative /",
          "we did the tour on our first night in town and was not disappointed. The staff was knowledgeable about the history and were sensitive to our 10 year old when she started to get scared and didn't want to hear the more graphic stories. We had a great time overall though getting",
          "The goal is located in a complex of buildings near the Torrens River. I decided to walk there from the CBD and found the walk along the road to be hot, dusty and noisy. However, the return walk along the river was most pleasant.",
          "Amazingly beautifully architectured structure to such a historical past filled with pain and suffering. The self-guided tour is easy to do and so informative. You easily spend two hours here reading.",
          "It's not expensive to visit but it could have been made much more exciting with more imagination. I've done other old gaol tours with headphones and recordings of stories as you wander round. The history was interesting and I'm glad I went but was underwhelmed.",
          "I can't believe it was still being used so recently. A real eye opener for the kids, even if a little spooky.",
          "Is a great self tour where everything is explained to you along the way. Would definitely recommend to others.",
          "Absolutely amazing place. Been twice. Once during day. Then a guided evening tour. Planning on goinv back for a night time ghost tour. The place is facinating. I lived reading all the graffiti scratched inti and written on the back of the cell doors. And the temp deffo drops in",
          "This was a bit on the outskirts of the main city but worth the trek. Is as it was with a lot of information. Self led tour around with information boards. I found it fascinating and worth thee entrance fee",
          "Spent the afternoon here. Lots of history. Being a prisoner here would have been awful, being able to see inside some cells was a great insight of how it would have been. Right down to the contraband etc. To think the last hanging was only in 1964. Well worth the visit",
          "We found the guide at the front desk to be incredibly helpful and so insightful. She said she'd only just started but her knowledge was great. We enjoyed the self guided tour and reading about the history. What a fascinating place.",
          "A very interesting way to spend a few hours walking around the old Gaol and drinking in the history of the place. Can be a bit dark in places with the history of executions",
          "Visit the Adelaide Gaol on one day trip and three night ghost tours. What a place, wouldn't like to have been a prisoner but very interesting to visit with amazing history. If you're lucky you might even see a ghost or two!!",
          "When we went it was self tour only. A well conducted guided tour would have been good to create a bit of life/drama/charisma into the displays. Interesting stories and artifacts abound.",
          "Spent much more time here than we planned as it was so interesting and lots to see. From the cells to gallows to the graves in th prison yards, great part of history",
          "Absolutely loved the Adelaide Gaol. Fascinating to go through each building and follow the history. And I ended up buying a ghost book written by our tour guide the next night! Icing in the cake would have been a ghostly experience, but you just can't ask and receive.",
          "This is a brilliant place if you love to be scared, not sure if there are any ghosts there but we managed to scared the hell out of ourselves. It is a must see.",
          "The Adelaide goal is a dull but historical place. Its cold and lack lustre...but then it is a jail. You will have a tour guide and be part of a larger group which is great. Apparently there are ghosts but we didn't see or hear any. I wouldn't do it again.",
          "If you love history, this is the place to go. We have visited 3 times and loved it every time. The guides are really interesting and have so information. You get goosebumps in the last room they take you",
          "Been a few times now, and I love reading all the information about the inmates and make up stories to scare whoever I am with.",
          "I happen to stumble across the Gaol and for anyone interested in history I would definitely recommend going! The interactive exhibits in gate 1 are incredible with real items from the days the gaol was operating. The graves at the back were a little eerie but reading the history",
          "I'm a history buff so old gaols are just heaven. This is a well presented informative set up which provides a great insight into conditions not just in the gaol but in the larger community during early settlement. Allow plenty of time as there is a lot to see.",
          "Having lived in Adelaide for most of my life, I have often gone past the Old Adelaide Gaol - but never in it. On the spur of the moment, and because I wanted to get out and do something, I decided to take a look. As Adelaide's original gaol, the buildings are old (old by",
          "We went really early - just as it was opening and it was quiet and we were able to take our time and not be interrupted. Nice walk around - highlighted by another visitor who used to work doing maintenance on the facility. The staff didn't really mingle with the visitors but we",
          "it was a good for a look but there could have been more examples of its early history on show. Easy to walk to from the city center but the signage a bit confusing. Plenty of parking if going by car.",
          "This goal was still used up to 1988! Interesting to see the hanging gallows, original prison cells (built in 1841) without any upgrades. There are markers where prisoners are buried along teh back walls. The tour is self-guided so you can go at your own pace.",
          "Very interesting insight into the way prisoners lived in early days, from 1941 all the way through to its closure in 1988. The Gaol Preservation Society have been doing a great job and there has recently been some interactive displays introduced which are likely to keep the",
          "It is a good tour if you like gaols. It is up with the old Melbourne and Dubbo. The volunteers are very helpful and very willing to share the history. They will happily provide details of any felons in the family.",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect, was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the tour. Wasn't corny and over dramatic. Based on facts and very eerie. You will get goosebumps! Really enjoyed it with a group of friends.",
          "Good to visit and get the history of crime in South Australia. Good to see how people where held till recently - not very nice. Spooky, but worth a visit soon.",
          "went here with my boyfriend and learnt about all the history of the place and how it all worked and how they all lived day to day, great place to visit",
          "Was quite interesting, spent a bit over an hour here. The kids loved finding the items in the book. More access would of been been better, as well as a radio system to tell stories and history of the cells etc. Was freezing! The lady at the front desk was lovely.",
          "On a winters day during the week I was the only visitor. You follow their map and walk around on your own so you can take your time. Some great stories about some inmates. Very spooky standing on the trap door where some inmates were executed before hanging was no longer a",
          "A great incite into early Adelaide, and how the prison system worked Interesting how the prisoners made items to either get out or entertain themselves Well worth a visit Cheaply priced Great for family's",
          "Attended the recent once-a-year $3 admission day with my teen and young children in tow. We spent about 2 hours walking through every building and open cell, which were simply fascinating. Lots of information to read and helpful guides to chat with. Unbelievable to think that",
          "My husband and I attended a $3 open day at the gaol which was outstanding value for money. It's a fascinating place, one of the two oldest buildings in Adelaide and horrible to think that it was in operation until 1988. I love that when Adelaide was first established as a free",
          "The self-guided tour was very informative and the volunteers were helpful and eager to teach us more about the gaol and it's history. It was a very pleasant day",
          "The Adelaide Gaol is a must-see if you visit this lovely city. A major part of Adelaide's heritage it's an excellent look into life as a prisoner between 1841 - 1988. It was the first permanent gaol in South Australia and is one of the two oldest buildings still standing in the",
          "Although I am a local I had never previously visited Adelaide Gaol. I am glad i have now. The Gaol was better than we anticipated and is well preserved and attended. We spent 2 hours doing the self-guided tour at our own pace, reading the signage taking in the eerie ambiance.",
          "We took our friends from Drifter Paranormal to visit the Old Adelaide Gaol - whilst we had a great day in one of Adelaide's most fascinating historic locations, it just isn't the same without the Adelaide Gaol Preservation Societies displays, which were informative and gave the",
          "Unfortunately my friend and I had already visited the goal in Melbourne so I personally found this one a little boring. It did have drawings from the guy that did the ettamogah pub drawings.The wall on the inside has some of the prisoners buried in it. We had a lovely walk",
          "The gaol is a 30 minute walk from North Terrace and so a little way out from the city centre which perhaps discourages some visitors. Service buses can be used. This gaol only closed 30'ish years ago. It is a first class museum which brings to life the penal system which",
          "This is well worth the trip. You go on a self guided tour which is easy to follow but be prepared to jump at all the creaks and groans especially if there is no one else around at the time you are taking the tour. The odd manequin also adds to the eerie vibe. The history in this",
          "It was a great way to spend a couple of hours. Interesting visit, very spooky! I'd recommend going when it's not raining as a lot of the facility is outdoors.",
          "We did this tour with my cousin and her young family. It was very interesting walking around on the self guided tour(map and information provided). The kids thought it was cool being locked up in the cells that were accessible. It was informative reading about the history of the",
          "Did this during the daytime - I'm pretty sure I wouldn't handle this place at night. Eerie. Not as spooky as Port Arthur is Tasmania, but close. The graves, the solitary cells, the hanging room. Visit this place.",
          "Enjoyable walkabout tour. Excellent volunteers who loved to tell the tales of the prisoners & the history. Their passion made it made it all the more interesting. It was a good way to spend an hour. Would recommend it to anyone.",
          "Not even sure if it's worth the $14 admission, although some parts were interesting. I wouldn't recommend this tour at all.",
          "Three of us went to the gaol and really enjoyed it. Learnt lots from the amount of information given. Could feel how the criminals lived and felt during there time here. The hanging tower and cemetery were very emotional areas but were fascinating at the same time. Would like it",
          "Very good historical tour. Very informative, would bring visitors to Adelaide here. The guides were very friendly and shared lots of useful info.",
          "Great insight to what it was like to be a criminal and what life and death was all about. It looks like a lot of effort has gone into some of the displays, but so much of it was not open which a bit disappointing eg. Upstairs in the new building. On the whole pretty good.",
          "We found this experience highly fascinating. The atmosphere whilst walking around is incredible. So interesting, especially the hanging room. Knowing that between the outer wall and inner wall are buried hanged criminals of the past is an eerie feeling. Well worth the time",
          "Love it. It was very emotional to look inside jaol. Very friendly staff. Strongly recommend everybody. It is a part of Australian history",
          "A place that is hard to believe was still in use until 1988. It is a stark reminder on the importance of treating fellow people with dignity. A good visit.",
          "Self quided tour was interesting. Very eerie feeling in some places. Learned a few things along the way. Was a bit disappointed that there was not much on show would have been better if more sections were restored and opened like the hospital. Staff did not really seemed to",
          "We enjoyed our self-guided tour of the gaol. The history was very interesting, and the grounds and exhibits were very well maintained. We'd definitely recommend a visit to this attraction!",
          "I love history so the Old Gaol had me fascinated. Due to there being several stages of construction over several decades, there have been recent archeological finds that had been lost in history. Well preserved and with plenty of information, complete with a ghostly feel, Old",
          "The goal is good for a look, there is a great wealth of info and guided tours, learning by the displays and seeing the cells set up as they were in the day. It is for sure a good example of a preserved past and will make people realize what punishment was like. It is free and",
          "Unfortunately the night tours are on hold at the moment. Still this place is run by a non-for-profit organisation and you are free to go in there and have a look around. A great place to take bored kids, or if you want to take your time and go in there by yourself to learn some",
          "We found parking at the gaol very easy after visiting other city sites. The gaol was interesting, but at times the lights in the rooms (on timers) didn't respond to pushing and as the day was very dark and dismal this made it hard to see things. The dummies in some rooms are",
          "Fantastic afternoon spent with friends! We went on the open day, so we only paid $3 each to get in - bargain!! Even managed to go on some free tours and talk to many experienced staff who knew lots and were so passionate!",
          "It was rather hard to get into the gaol from the North Terrace end of the city due to traffic restrictions, but the place is extremely interesting. It was a little pricey ($14 per head) but well signposted for the self guided tour. Worth a visit.",
          "Had a couple of hours to kill and decided to visit the goal. It was extremely interesting especially as the price of admission included a map and some information on the history of the place. To visit the cells and read about the prisoner who was in that cell made it a very",
          "I'm easily spooked and this place certainly made me jump more than once. It's nice to be able to walk around at your own pace and plenty of signs around to make you aware of the use of buildings around you. The small museum was a good break, we spent about 30 minutes trying to",
          "My partner and I spent the early afternoon here and we thouroughly enjoyed it. The staff were lovely and the minute you approach the front doors you get an eery historic feeling. We loved looking in all the different cells and reading the stories of certain individuals. Overall",
          "Did the guided night tour, lots of eerie ghost stories and some insight to the history of the prison. Was interesting and at times very spooky. There was a big group on the night and we were all waiting to spot ghosts but nothing really happen, although at times within the",
          "We took the three kids aged 9, 11 and 13 for a visit to the jail. It was certainly eye opening but from the moment we stepped in the door our youngest just wanted to get out. She felt really uneasy, perhaps a bit too confronting? The older two were more interested. I think we",
          "A fascinating insight into prison life in early Australia 1841 to 1988. We done a self guided tour following the map provided. Parking available on site and on street adjacent to the site.",
          "The Adelaide Gaol was located about 2 bus stops away from where we were staying during the trip and we took a bus near to West Terrace Tram Station and we walked all the way in. Initially due to the hot sun, my friend and I were feeling dehydrated but all was worth it when we",
          "I found the gaol interesting and scary all at the same time. It was recently a working gaol and has erry items like security cameras and visitors rooms. I cant get over how hot it could get their and the standards of the room being so poor. Although not a must see thing of",
          "My farther was visiting from england so decided to take him here. We were both very impressed. Unfortunately due to funding cuts there is no guided tour but all the articles are very good. The hangmans tower is very atmospheric. There are some sad tales of people being executed.",
          "The kids loved visiting this attraction, we did the self guided tour. Only mistake we made was we arrived here on a Saturday and it does not open so had to go back on Sunday (10:00am opening)",
          "It's a wasteland. You have so much history going to waste in this place. The self guided tour really doesn't tell you anything. You walk into one of their yards and it's just... space... Then you have the ridiculous entrance to the place which, to be fair, is NOT their",
          "After a daytime visit, I would like to try this at night... really interesting, pretty small scale, a good couple hours will give you a good feel for the place and how it must have been.",
          "We went on a weekend that had special events and filled in a few hours, the volunteers were great offering information on the history of the gaol. I'm glad we went on the special event day though as I don't think we would have stayed more than an hour if there weren't",
          "In original as vacated condition, one can wander around at leisure, visit the execution tower, hold the scaffold lever, see the graves of those executed, not to be missed.",
          "We went on the Ghost Tour during the night. Too many \"stories\" of ghost experiences. There was a vague description of a few inmates, but not much history of the gaol itself. I understand we went on the Ghost Tour, however nothing happened (which I know isn't anyone's fault), and",
          "We did a self guided tour of the gaol and it was well worth it. Lots to see and lots of interesting information. Similar to other goals if you've been to others. The price was appropriate for what it was. Lots of interesting artifacts to see as well.",
          "The Adelaide Gaol has a long and interesting history which is well presented on a guided tour of the site. Interesting to note the archaeological dig in one part that pre-dates the building of the gaol. Well worth the visit",
          "We did a night tour this time. I found it exciting and was looking behind me the whole time. There is something about the Adelaide Gaol day or night, that puts a little tingle up your spine. The hanging tower did lose some of it's previous appeal due to the smell of fresh paint,",
          "We did a self tour, arrived early just after it opened so only few people walking around. A brochure with the different divisions was given & also you can borrow a laminated page of the peoples graves and details of when they were executed! Having had a family member spend",
          "Not a place I want to review as I haven't enjoyed visiting . I do think some would find it's history and it;s tales of woe interesting and the architecture is worth a look",
          "I'm a huge fan of Gaols, and have visited several since coming to Australia, & I'm glad to say this one did not disappoint. I didn't have a guide, and simply walked around myself, but you are given a map with the route the guides take, ensuring you see everything. There are",
          "This Gaol is a part of Adelaide history old and new, having closed in 1987. We enjoyed walking around and looking at all the interesting features of the prison. The lady on reception was so helpful and made sure we were looked after and gave us directions around the Gaol. As we",
          "One of the best attractions of Adelaide. The tour of the gaol is a must-see when visiting Adelaide. The history of this place is quite fascinating, visiting the graves of prisoners condemned to death can be a moving experience.",

          "I had passed this iconic building many times over nearly 60 years - and was thrilled to learn I could visit this amazing historical Adelaide building. It is a wonderful exhibit of how life was for those who broke the laws from 1841 to 1988 - amazing that this building would",

          "Enjoyed our experience of the prison and it\u2019s history. Staff were really helpful and informative. A little disappointed some of the prison was out of bounds due to a private function and this didn\u2019t reflect in the cost of admission. If you\u2019re missing a third of the prison it should be reduced by a third. Seems fair.",

          "Surprising off the beaten track Adelaide attraction. It's one of those slightly eerie  adventures where you almost feel that step back in time; imagining what those old stone walls have seen and heard is a thrilling, creepy contrast to the surreal peacefulness of the grounds today.",

          "This is a beautiful old house. Thank goodness Don Dunstan prevented its demolition. Part of the house is used for commercial purposes - weddings etc and is not open, but the rest of the house is well worth a visit",
          "We loved this tour. We paid for the guided tour which was well worth the additional 5 dollars. Barbara showed us the top 2 floors and Grant the basement. Both were friendly and knowledgeable. We learned a lot about Mr. Ayers, Adelaide and the house. You can take all the photos",
          "Sir Henry Ayres House is wonderfully preserved. It feels as if he just left. The house is in the central business district (on the edge really) so easy to get to. It is a terrific remnant of Adelaide's history and is very touchy-feely as they are very liberal with access to all",

          "This beautiful property is a must for lovers of the Victorian era style houses. Built in the 19th century, it has been beautifully maintained by the National Trust. All of the original furniture was sold off so whilst the house has since been decked out with furniture in the",

          "We walked past Ayers House on our recent visit to Adelaide and made sure we stopped by properly to visit. Definitely worth it and I'm so glad we made the effort to come. The lady on the front desk was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave us a quick rundown on The history of",
          "We visited during a recent open day and enjoyed a self-guided tour for a donated admission fee. I'm not entirely sure that we were able to access all the same areas as one would on an ordinary tour, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. The children were able to role play with",
          "Wonderful being taken back to the 1800s by the butler and staff for a night tour of this beautiful house. Thank you we had a lovely time.",
          "This is a must see house in the heart of town so easily accessible. The tour guide was dressed for the occasion and we enjoyed Devonshire tea after the tour. Beautiful furnishings.",
          "Easily accessible on North terrace, this gorgeous house sits within a small garden sanctuary. Great rooms, fascinating exhibits. Occasionally the Museum has special exhibitions (costumes from TV series for example), and while free to National trust members there is an admission",

          "My wife and I encountered this lovely old house while strolling along the North Terrace. It is an fascinating look at how the upper class lived in late 19th century Adelaide. Sir Richard Ayers gave his name to Ayers Rock, now called Uluru, and as we were visiting this location",
          "I stumbled across this lovely old home when I was visiting the Museum and Art Gallery. I had recently been to see Martindale Hall and was interested to learn about the connection. It is lovely to be able to experience walking through these old buildings and try to imagine what",
          "We only had a day to explore Adelaide and spotted that Ayers House was a National Trust property so we opted to visit. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and we are glad that we chose the guided tour - very reasonable at just \u20ac5 each. There is also the option to just",
          "A 90 minute tour of a former government officer doesn't sound like much fun but this great old building (now a modern hotel) has been managed to ensure the history hasn't been lost. Our tour guide was extremely knowledge and kept the tour moving. For the original cabinet room",
          "Thought we'd pop in to have a look . Ayers house gives you a good insight into what it was like back in the day . It would be a great place for a wedding or big function very nicely presented.",
          "Attended the wedding of a niece at this location. Setting was very good for a smaller wedding. Room is nicely laid out in the old style and suites this purpose. Parking is not too bad and the is a pub close within a short walk for guests to take refreshments.",
          "Lovely old building that you're allowed to wander through on your own. You can go down in the cellars as well as up to the bedrooms on the first floor. Gives you a great sense of the period. Good value at $10. A must see!",
          "This historic house is worth a wander round if you're interested in how the wealthy folks of Adelaide lived years ago. Unfortunately on the day I visited no tour guide was available (there are usually hourly tours) so I walked round alone. The friendly staff member on duty gave",
          "This place has an excellent historical record of the early days of Adelaide and the families who figured prominently in its founding days. The place is much larger than first appears and teh displays have something for everyone.",
          "Ayers House sounded interesting from the guidebooks so we went along to take a look. We were offered our own personal guided tour - no waiting for any others to show up. Our guide then walked us round the house for the next thirty minutes, pointing out many features and",
          "I visited this for an exhibition - I was so interested to see the house which I understand to have been the home of Henry Ayers who also had a summer residence on the front at Glenelg - seems to have original features - seems to have several rooms so good for a small exhibition",
          "Sadly 1 of the poorest publicised exhibitions I have come across. Heard about its showing in Victoria and was lucky enough to literally stumble across it's Adelaide showing the day before it closed! So glad I did though as it was marvellous.The intricate detail in the garments",
          "National Trust has once again done a fantastic job of curating a dress exhibition - clothes designed by Marion Boyce from the Dressmaker movie. Ayers House showcased the exhibition. Cant wait for further showcases",
          "Visited this house and found that the contents had largely been removed and there was an exhibition of costumes from The Dresser. This meant that National Trust members had to pay the exhibition admission to see the house instead of getting in for free. The decor of the house is",

          "This memorial won\u2019t take long to see, but worth it if you are passing by. A very fitting tribute to honour all the soldiers that lost their lives during the war.",
          "I was walking past on the way to the Botanic Gardens and ended up stopping for 3/4 of an hour going through the extensive role of fallen heroes to see if any of my family was on the wall. No surprises but still evoking some deep-felt emotion for the diggers who served there",
          "It is an excellent view of the city and the flame outside is a good memory about not forget them. Its a good experience including the foreigners",
          "Nice War Memorial to those who served in World War One. The Memorial was unveiled at the Anzac Day Service 1931. Very impressive and worth a visit.",
          "Great Memorial with beautiful panels inside with all the names on of those who served. You can walk down the road on the memorial walk next to this",

          "On the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue stands the National War Memorial, a monument commemorating those who served in WW1. It is a powerful sculpture made from marble from Angaston and Macclesfield. In the arched marble relief facing the Terrace, the Spirit of Duty",
          "Situated in a prominent position, this National War Memorial is very impressive. The fact that you can go in underneath to read the names of the fallen is amazing and we were very impressed that it is in such beautiful condition - inside and out. Well worth taking the time to",
          "Don't miss this come and pay your respects, it is so easy as a tourist to just walk on by and do all the touristy bits but sometimes take a breath and look about, don't forget the past",
          "I don't think there are too many monuments like this that you can enter. It was powerful to go in and have the sounds from the traffic muffle down and spend a few minutes thinking about the huge loss of life during WW1.",
          "This is so good because it is different, because it has a strong humanity focus, because of its position. This is public sculpture at its best.",
          "The position of this structure is brilliant as you can't miss it if you walk or drive along North Terrace or Kintore Avenue. It is compact, but has such an atmosphere & really encourages you to consider all the lives that have been lost in all the wars.",
          "This is perfectly scaled and well presented. It is so sad to see the names of so many brave men who lost their lives but at least they have been immortalised.",
          "Visiting family and we attended Remembrance Day service , it is definitely worth stopping and having a look if you are down visiting the art gallery or museum. Lest we Forget.",
          "The First World War -- then referred to as the Great War -- took a terrible toll on Australia, with a casualty rate of 65%. This is a South Australian memorial rather than a national one, but it is quite grand. The structure is influenced by the Art Deco style, which was",
          "i love this memorial the outside is very nice and i love the inside we spent ten minutes going through the names and trying to find the names of family members. i do not recommend going at night as i have heard that homeless people stay in there",
          "It's on of those things you can so easily walk past, but itis worth going in to have a look. The external sculptures are stunning",
          "I am always awed by the sense of loss that must have been felt by so many families. Understated but effective Less we forget",
          "When you visit make sure that you go inside as well, the names of all the people who died in the wars are there.",
          "A very peaceful and reflective part of Adelaide. I suggest taking a coffee and or your lunch and sit in this respectful little space",
          "This is beautiful memorial, you can go inside the sculpture and see names of fallen heroes engraved in the walls.",
          "Walking along North Terrace road, we came across the war memorial. We have visited many war memorials across Australia and this is one of them. Not particularly big, but you still see many visitors posing in front of it.",
          "We spent some time viewing every apect of this amazing war memorial on North Terrace. The memorial is a wonderful tribute to all those amazing people who given their all for this country and acknowledges every conflict where we have lost lives of such wonderful people.",
          "The National War Memorial is a significant feature on Adelaide`s North Terrace. It is a poignant reminder and symbolic of the fine balance between war and peace. I recommend visitors enter the memorial to view the information and names of those who lost their lives in the World",
          "Beautiful Memorial with secret entrance don't just take a photo walk around it & go inside & look up at the ceiling...",
          "Just up from the Railway station on North Terrace this is a beautiful memorial to the fallen hero\u2019s lost in many conflicts throughout the years.",
          "Walked past here on the way to the Torrens Parade Ground. Peaceful and central location. Respectful national memorial.",
          "This memorial on North Terrace is a wonderful monument and respectful tribute to the fallen. There is pine tree behind this monument, which is a descendent of the \"lone-pine\" from Turkey.",
          "When I walked pass it, I had decided to go for a walk as the area was so quiet and peacefully where people would so wanted to sit down and think about whats in it, just about a war memorial or the beloved one they lost, and who sacrified in the war really were heroes. God",
          "How many Australians gave their lives to help the British army in World War 1. My UK family served in the field ambulances and I had not appreciated that there were Australians serving serving in the same Royal Army Medical Corp (RAMC)",
          "We walked up to this place when we stayed for the coupled of days and the work that has gone into this piece wonderful.",

          "Was there on Remembrance Day and the love for those who had lost their lives for others to live better was tangible. It is a place to reflect and appreciate what we have and what we have lost.",
          "The memorial stands on a prominent place next to the musea. After having seen The Aznac monument in Alice Springs we realized that many Australians have been fighting wars in Europe and Asia as part of the Common Wealth forces.",
          "It is a nice monument in a nice park near reflecting pools that honors Australia's war dead and living veterans. Very meaningful this Remembrance Day.",
          "Armistice Day yesterday. Service and wreath laying ceremony in morning and another ceremony later in afternoon with about 180 pipers and drummers from Adelaide pipe bands marching through streets of Adelaide.",
          "Stopped by this memorial on a walk about, it quite serene and peaceful even though it\u2019s close to a main road, after seeing the names that were displayed it does make you think how lucky we are. The monument is well kept and clean and free from graffiti.",
          "Walking along the area of the University of Adelaide and Terrace street one stumbles upon the expressive and graceful memorial. It honors the amazing and courageous sacrifice of Australian warriors fighting for the freedom and peace of others in World War One. The memorial",
          "Stopped to pay our respects at the memorial. One thing that Australia does very well is create respectful and grand memorials to their servicemen and women. The whole thing is worth a visit but don't forget the crosses etc that have been brought back from overseas and are",
          "The memorial seemed smalll until you realize there is an interior portion as well. Worth walked through.",
          "I only saw this twice in passing, but I thought it was a very poignant memorial to those lost in battle.",
          "I took a walk down North Terrace from the Stamford Plaza Hotel to the Botanic Gardens, and I was totally impressed by the number of grand heritage buildings along the way, including the War Memorial but also among many others, the buildings of Adelaide Uni, South Australian Uni",
          "The Adelaide War Memorial commemorates those who made the ultimate sacrifice in World War 1 and is situated adjacent to Government House. During our travels through various countries we have seen many variations of war memorials, some imposing and some small, but all with a",

          "Almost 35,000 South Australians served in the First World War. This number amounted 38% of men between the ages of 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 or 14% South Australians died. The memorial is dedicated to the memory of South Australians who died in the World War I.",

          "There is a room inside the memorial and seeing this plus the memorial walkway down to the river was very moving.",
          "The War Memorial is an outstanding memorial to the fallen from all wars. It\u2019s interesting how the names of the fallen from 1st WW are inscribed inside. The plaque for 2nd WW is outside.",
          "This is a small memorial but is very well worth a visit. Mostly pays tribute to the soldiers that fought in world war 1, when such a huge percentage of men went overseas to fight. Great place to pay tribute.",
          "Located 5-10 minutes walk from the Rundle Mall shopping district and amongst the city's cultural, government and garden highlights. This monument if quite different in style to their capital city war memorial monuments but wonderfully sincere and serene. Do take a look.",

          "We just happened to spot this as we were taking a bus tour around the city and decided to come back for a closer look. If the side door is open you can go inside and see the names of all those that gave their lives and in which battle. Around the outside is the original crosses",
          "One thing that us Yanks fail to realize is how traumatic the World Wars were for Australia. In the states, we don't think much nor honor the memory of WW1. In Australia, it's still a major memory. Stop by and pay your respects, for a country that sacrificed much for us to be",

          "You rarely see this size of memorials in Europe. It\u2019s great to see the respect that is shown to former (and current) servicemen. This memorial is mostly WW1, but there are statues, and other memorials in the surrounding area/garden.",
          "If you go visiting the museums, you can hardly miss the National War Memorial. It is just average, architecture-wise.",
          "I attended the dawn service for Anzac Day, and then inspected the new avenue of remembrance which links the War Memorial to the Parade Ground. The design, art work and lighting for the new avenue beautifully complements the original memorial (with its internal room below where",
          "It was lovely to see such a fitting tribute to the fallen. There is no doubt as to how they honour their fallen and it is moving to see this and all other memorials in the area. It is well worth looking and walking around these sights. I can see why the RSL is so well thought of",
          "Adelaide does War memorabillia well. It seems to fit in with the street landscaping and architecture. This was simple but effective",
          "We stopped by to reflect on all those lives that have been lost to so many wars. This is a lovely monument to the fallen.",
          "Large memorial placed on a prominent corner for maximum viewind. Celebrates and remembers the fallen.",
          "That kind of monument isn't usually quite attractive but this one is impressive by its size by the fact you can enter in it, and is not ugly. This being said it's not a must.",

          "The War Memorial stands on the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue and while impressive in itself it is just one of many buildings, features of interest etc in the immediate vicinity including a Convention Centre, the Parliament building, Government House, the South",
          "In all the countries we've visited I believe Australia gives the most sincere and heartfelt emotional displays. The monument is awesome. The outside ring holds a number of enclosed crosses presented to represent different units or branches of service bearing witness to the main",
          "I was lucky enough to be in Adelaide last weekend. Attended the service here. Although only a small monument it does make us remember the fallen.",

          "A moving tribute to respect, honour and remember those who fought for our country, I thank you for your service.",
          "Well positioned in Adelaide, main structure quite striking. Meaningful crosses around the perimeter, each with its own story. Disappointed that the crosses were not well maintained, many being overtaken by ivy, spider webs, accumulated leaves and dust.",
          "Easily accessible on North Terrace and good photo opportunity. Very nicely maintained with well upkept garden area.",
          "Both are close to Rundle Mall. War Memorials and related Walks are sombre, serious places. I appreciated the homage paid to war veterans, and the well maintained and designed monument. I just found it a bit jarring that the faces on the War Walk looked happy - as if they were",
          "The national war memorial is worth a visit and the parade showing the plaques to the various theatres of war is very moving. Include as part of the historical stroll along North Terrace.",
          "If you have any interest in history these two memorials are definitely worth a visit. The National Memorial is fairly traditional but the ANZAC Memorial is an absolute work of art - very impressive. They are located near each other.",
          "An impressive memorial to people who lost their lives. Definitely worth a look if you are in the area.",
          "While walking to the Botanical Gardens from our hotel, we came upon the National War Memorial, on North Terrace. The imposing structure caught our attention, a few blocks away. As we approached, I began taking it all in. Though marked on my maps, it had not made it to my",

          "Located at the north edge of the city, this memorial honors those who died in WWI. It is sad to read the names that are etched on the walls of the inner shrine, but when you look at the scenes of South Australian youth responding to the call for sacrifice you look at the",

          "The monument is a fitting tribute to those that lost their lives in the big WW1 and after. The remembrance room is cool and worth a look. My only comment is on the three bronzes and the plough, not sure what the plough is about? Harvesting souls into heaven or something. Still",

          "This memorial sits in a prominent place on North Terrace and Kintore Avenue. It is a four sided monument praising the fallen in World War One. The clever thing with this is that there are openings on both sides so that the public can see the names of the fallen by battles. There",
          "Outside Government House is a lovely looking War Memorial and not far from other Adelaide attractions. But one thing was not so good the park near the Memorial and Government House was a mess, I am not raciest but the two times we walk past the park Aboriginals were Drinking",

          "I've been fortunate to travel to the Western Front and see some of the larger War Memorials in the world, and whilst they have their place, importance and obvious significance, The National War Memorial does something that few others do. It stands there as a quiet reminder to",

          "It feels strange rating such a place of remembrance, reflection and cultural significance. It's an impressive War Memorial, that was \"opened\" on ANZAC Day 1931; still holding numerous memorial services each year. Sadly, it was undergoing extensive maintenance during our visit,",
          "This landmark in Adelaide on the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue has in more recent times become a place for other War Memorials and rightly so. Tilletts are still in existence down on West Terrace opposite the Cemetery and they deserve to take pride in this majestic",
          "Adelaide's National War Memorial location and its impressive architecture make it a prominent landmark. Its prime purpose is to honour those who made the supreme sacrifice in times of war and it is a worthy memorial to the fallen. During my recent visit, most passers-by either",
          "A Sobering experience, as it is with any War Memorial, but again beautifully laid out and maintained.",
          "The National War Memorial is a great insight into those who fought for South Australia in various wars and was a great place to see.",
          "On North Terrace. Go inside and read the boards of Remembrance.View the gardens and statutes. Sit and reflect.",
          "A very lovely edifice, a quiet corner on a busy street, listing the fallen within. Good for the young to appreciste those whomsacrificed themselves for us all.",
          "Amazing tribute to the soldiers of our country,the craftsmanship of the stone masons and architects are truely wonderful.",
          "A short stop here gave the impression that Adelaide values the service of its military. Worth a visit.",
          "Often have walked past the National War Memorial, and have been inspired by the white marble monument, with the angel and three people kneeling before the angel. But until the other day I have never actually stoped and looked around the memorial and inside the memorial. Behind",
          "Having attended Anzac dawn service in a few spots across town, this has to be on the best ones. The memorial itself is simple yet very lovely for a visit. It's located near the rest of the Adelaide 'must visit' spots so if you're out and about go past and have a look. If you are",
          "A stunning memorial to all our servicemen and servicewomen. The main memorial is a beautiful structure. When you walk inside it features a honour roll. Loved all the ww1 wooden memorials around the periphery of memorial",
          "The South Australian War Memorial is a beautiful tribute to the fallen. In April 2016 the Kintore Avenue War Memorial walk was also opened. Easy to get to on North Tce and beautiful gardens nearby.",
          "This is one of the best Memorials I have seen, the stone and marble carved is amazing, and the names.. so many.. plus the surrounding crosses and stories.",
          "Visited the War Memorial after the March on Anzac Day. It was covered with wreaths laid during the Dawn Service. Worth a visit if you are in the City of Adelaide.",
          "Went into Adelaide to see the new wall it is most impressing and well worth a visit. It is just past the war memorial down Kintore Avenue. Also you now can get a good view of Government House through the new fence,",
          "A long granite wall etched with figures from all aspects of the armed forces, from the waler horses of WW1, tracker dogs who work to find IUDs, images of nurses, diggers and much more. The images are etched into the wall by small \"dots\" and from the distance the effect is",
          "I am biased because I have military knowledge and experience but the National War Memorial together with the brand new ANZAC Walk is outstanding. There is a lot to discover and enough to keep one interested for several hours. The scope of the displays and the associated",
          "Commeration place for those souls lost in War, it's a magnificent monument that all South Australians can take pride in, see how many turn up for the Dawn Service on Anzac Day.",
          "No words can describe the emotion you feel when you're inside the memorial looking at the list of our Diggers who gave their lives in service of our nation. Well worth a visit.",
          "This was a must see I was told--and I agree. It was very thought provoking. There was a solemn air inside and it was sobering seeing all the names and regiments.",
          "This war memorial is a sad place for me as it remembers those who have died in wars. It is, however, quite an imposing reminder of the hopelessness of war if int are interested.",
          "Whilst in Adelaide on the Anzac weekend, I went to my first Dawn service at this war memorial. It was a beautiful service and so many people turned up to pay their respects. This is a beautiful monument and well worth taking the time to look through it and even just take time",
          "The designer captured the emotion of that episode in time, very moving. When you study this monument there is so much more to see as you walk around it.",
          "A walk down town to the river brings you not only to interesting museum but to this memorial, follow the street right along the river till us see the sign Adelaide ZOO. Surprisingly it is a well laid out zoo with a pleasing walk to see the animal's and you don,t miss the Panda",
          "The Anzac Memorial Walk on Kintore Avenue, Adelaide, worth visiting especially with children as they can run safely and peer into the Governor's residence",
          "Looking forward to visiting the Memorial for the ANZAC Day service, there's been a lot of work going on around the memorial and it's looking good.",
          "You can't get as close as you should due to current renovations taking place. We stopped and had a look. A fitting memorial to all those that gave their all.",
          "Mid April 2016 there is some significant road works going on around this monument so you can't really get close. You can still appreciate it from a distance so if your going near it, I'd recommend still having a look.",
          "I have looked at this many times. I always think it is in a strange place - on the corner of an intersection. But if you combine it with a walk around it is good.",
          "The museum is absolutely fascinating and the volunteers who welcomed us, on entry, were so very helpful in pointing us to the best things to see as we had restricted time. Well worth a visit",
          "When we were in the city, the National War Memorial was being revamped, with a new path being opened from Kintore Avenue. The workmanship of the sculpture is of high standard and the design very pleasing. It makes you think of the alternatives to wretched war.",
          "I like to take walk around the city when I am there. I recommend north tce as there are many nice sites to see within the city.",
          "Located in close proximity to the city centre on North Terrace - a magnificent memorial to those servicemen who gave their all in WW1. Constructed of marble and bronze, lists of servicemen by battalion are within. Quiet reflection draws one to thoughts of the horrors these",
          "Located on North Terrace its easy to get to the memorial. Its made out of marble and bronze and you can see the lists of servicemen on the walls on the inside of the memorial. There is a dawn service on anzac day (25th of april) and a service on Remeberance Day (11th November)",
          "I used to spend quite a bit of time hanging around here as a teenager, namely because he would spend a lot of time at the State Library and when my mates wanted a cigarette they would always come out here and sit on the steps in from of the pond. This place is pretty basic when",
          "Impressive but unable to have a close look because it has been cordoned off due to renovations. Well located and very grand . Should look great when surrounds are completed. Can't help feeling sad when you are reminded of all the lives lost - sacrificed for little gain.",
          "A wonderful tribute to our service men & women in a prominent place for all to see. Remember to visit and pay your respects when in the city centre.",
          "Large, impressive and rightly moving memorial. Overlooks the city from a high hill. Makes you think.",
          "Anyone who wishes to pay tribute to those who gave their lives to ensure our freedom, must visit here. You will be touched by their memorials!",
          "A small but very moving memorial thoughtfully designed and a pleasure to visit, the kids were studying WWI and read through the list of names for anyone familiar with the stories they were reading.",
          "Take a few moments to reflect on those who bravely gave so much so that we may have what we enjoy today. Sends shivers down my spine to think of what they had to endure.",
          "How do you really rate a war memorial? It's a moving tribute in the heart of the city, just down from the museums and government house.",
          "Good place to pay your respects but sadly poorly maintained. Urine smell emanated from it, I would have hated to be there on a hot day!",
          "This is a nice memorial that needs more. Unfortunately Adelaide misses out on providing a significant tribute to those that served. It's time to widen Kintore Ave as a boulavard memorial worthy of other cities in Australia.",
          "This is a lovely memorial and don't miss going underneath it and seeing all the names of the men and women who gave their lives. Well worth going to an ANZAC service here too. Lest We Forget.",
          "An excellent memorial to say thank you to all the people that have sacrificed in times of war and conflict",
          "National War Memorial is an important landmark on North Terrace. It\u2019s a monument to commemorate those who served in World War I. When memorial services are held at the site, many people gather around it to participate in the event. Every time when I passed by it, I often saw",
          "Memorial is on the smaller side compared to others in Australia but still has a powerful message and meaning to it. Worth the visit when in the city.",
          "Second war memorial we visited on this trip to Australia...first being The Shrine in Melbourne which is on a greater scale. Have walked past the Adelaide memorial many times while strolling along North Terrace...smaller than the Melbourne Memorial but no less impressive and is",
          "It's a wonderful commemoration, and it's truly beautiful. I stop to look at it every time I pass as a local. If you are interested in Australian history or war history, stop here for even just a few minutes while you are in the city centre.",
          "The War Memorial is simple yet beautiful, not as big as the one in Hyde Park Sydney or Brisbane.I like the way the front of the monument represents Spirt of Duty, the girl, the student and the farmer ) and the back of the monument Spirit of Compassion , bearing aloft the body of",
          "I admire the Australians for honoring those who died protecting their country. During my visit of 4 cities of Australia (Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide), I noted the presence of War Memorials in their parks. Adelaide has one located along the North Terrace Street",
          "Well worth a visit - an impressive and very fitting memorial to those who have fallen for their country.",
          "The marble and gold paint on the inside make this a really beautiful memorial. If you're on the tram walk get off at the hospital and walk along for a look, or walk 2 minutes down the road from the library.",
          "The National War Memorial is located on the corner of North terrace and Kintore Avenue. As well as being a large stone carved memorial, it also houses memorial panels inside (through the doors at each side) listing all those from South Australia who fell during the Great War."

It is the largest public research library in the state, with a collection focus on South Australian information, being the repository of all printed and audiovisual material published in the state, as required by legal deposit legislation. It holds the \"South Australiana\" collection, which documents South Australia from pre-European settlement to the present day, as well as general reference material in a wide range of formats, including digital, film, sound and video recordings, photographs, and microfiche. Home access to many journals, newspapers and other resources online is available.\n\n\n== History and governance ==\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Adelaide Mechanics Institute was founded just over a decade after the establishment of the colony, in 1847. This organisation merged with the South Australian Library in 1848, creating the \"Mechanics' Institute and South Australian Library\", based in Peacock's Buildings, Hindley Street. Nathaniel Summers was appointed as the first librarian. It subsequently moved to Exchange Chambers, King William Street, but by 1855 had gone into decline.In June 1856 the South Australian Legislative Council passed Act No. 16, the South Australian Institute Act, which incorporated the South Australian Institute under the control of a Board of Governors, to whose ownership all materials belonging to the old Library and Mechanics' Institute was immediately transferred. This Act also ensured the library would be open to the public free of charge, and granted funding was allocated to it. This made the library very popular particularly amongst artisans and workmen who filled it to capacity in the evenings. At this point it was a lending library, and held a large amount of fictional work. The Act also provided for a museum as part of the new organisation.As new books arrived from Britain, the library expanded and soon needed new accommodation, which was found in North Terrace in 1860.The Copyright Act (1878), Part II section 15, required that a copy of every book published in South Australia was to be deposited in the Institute by a process known as legal deposit, for preservation of the books. (After Federation, the Copyright Act (1905) replaced the earlier state copyright legislation with regard to legal deposit, but the State Library continues to collect and preserve locally produced material.)The Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery Act (1884) renamed the South Australian Institute as Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery, and also broadened the scope of the Board's control to include the expanding network of regional and suburban institutes. It also created a new, independent body, the Adelaide Circulating Library, to take over the business of circulating books on a subscription basis.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe next important piece of legislation affecting SLSA was the  1939 number 44 Libraries and Institutes Act, which repealed the Public library, Museum and Art Gallery and Institutes Act and separated the Public Library from the (newly named) Art Gallery of South Australia and South Australian Museum, established its own board and changed its name to the Public Library of South Australia. The new entity thus became a statutory corporation.Various reorganisations occurred through the years following, but the legislation still governing the Library is number 70 Libraries Act (1982), which repealed the Libraries and Institutes Act (1939\u22121979) and the Libraries (Subsidies) Act 1955-1977 (with the latest version as of July 2019 being 12 May 2011).During the 1990s, the Library became a Division under a series of departments, responsible to the Minister for the Arts. The State Records Act 1997 separated the responsibility for management and disposal of state government records, bringing this under a State Records Council rather than the Libraries Board.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nFrom 2001 the Library became part of the Division of Arts SA, which was part of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, continuing to report to the Minister for the Arts.After the election of the Marshall government in March 2018, the post of Minister for the Arts ceased to exist, Arts South Australia (as Arts SA was now known) was dismantled and its functions transferred to direct oversight by the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Arts and Culture section.\n\n\n== Mortlock Wing ==\n\nThe building now known as the Mortlock Wing was opened on 18 December 1884 as a \"Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery for the colony of South Australia\" with 23,000 books and a staff of three. It had taken over 18 years to complete after the initial foundations were laid in 1866. (In 1873 the foundations of the western wing of a proposed new block were laid, but there the matter ended until 1876, when fresh plans were drawn, and another set of foundations put in. Again the work went no further until 1879 when the west wing was finally commenced. The earlier work was condemned, and had to be removed before the Public Library could be started.) The foundation stone was laid on 7 November 1879 by Sir William Jervois and the building was constructed by Brown and Thompson at a total cost of \u00a343,897, and opened in 1884. Supervision for the Board of Directors was undertaken by secretary Robert Kay (1825\u20131904), later general director and secretary of the Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery of South Australia.\nThe building is French Renaissance in style with a mansard roof. The walls are constructed of brick with Sydney freestone facings with decorations in the darker shade of Manoora stone.\nThe interior has two galleries, the first supported by masonry columns, and the second by cast iron brackets. The balconies feature wrought iron balustrading ornamented with gold while the glass-domed roof allows the chamber to be lit with natural light. Two of the original gas \"sunburner\" lamps survive in the office space located on the second floor at the southern end.\nRestoration of the building occurred in 1985 as a Jubilee 150 project by Danvers Architects, consultant architect to the South Australian Department of Housing and Construction. The $1.5 million project was jointly funded by the government and the community.\nIn honour of a substantial bequest from John Andrew Tennant Mortlock, the Libraries Board of South Australia resolved that a percentage of the South Australiana Collections would be housed in the wing and named the Mortlock Library of South Australiana in 1986.\nAfter the State Library underwent a substantial redevelopment, commencing in 2001 and reaching completion in 2004, the main chamber of the Mortlock Wing became an exhibition space providing a glimpse into the history and culture of South Australia.\nIn August 2014 the Mortlock Wing featured in a list of the top 20 most beautiful libraries of the world, compiled by the U.S. magazine Travel + Leisure.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== General reference collections ===\nThe general reference and research material in the State Library was named the Bray Reference Library in 1987 after former SA Chief Justice, Dr John Jefferson Bray, who served on the Libraries Board of South Australia from 1944 to 1987.\n\n\n=== Heritage collections ===\nThe State Library has a national responsibility to collect, preserve and give access to historical and contemporary South Australian information. The South Australiana collections document South Australia from pre-white settlement to the present day, and the Northern Territory to 1911.  The South Australiana collection is one of the most comprehensive in the world due to legal deposit requirements for published material, and through donations of unpublished material.    A well known donation is the Bradman Collection of cricketing memorabilia.\n\n\n=== York Gate Geographical and Colonial Library ===\n\nThe York Gate Library was acquired from the estate of Stephen William Silver, of S. W. Silver and Co. (William) a London-based company who not only sold clothing, furniture and equipment suitable for emigrants to the British Colonies, but also a series books providing relevant information for such emigrants. William had started to collect objects and books related to the areas to which their customers were migrating. These were kept in his residence at 3 York Gate, London and hence became known as the York Gate Library. When he died on 7 March 1905, the South Australia branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia raised the money to buy the collection of nearly 5,000 volumes and pamphlets so they could be brought to Australia. In 2006, the centenary of the establishment of the library in Australia, the collection was threatened with eviction.\n\n\n=== Rare books ===\n\nThe State Library's rare books collection is the major collection of its kind in South Australia. It comprises Australian and international items which have been identified as having a special interest through subject matter or rarity.\n\n\n=== Children's Literature Research Collection ===\nThe Children's Literature Research Collection was formed in 1959 and has over 65,000 books, periodicals, comics, board and table games, and toys. The collection has been enhanced by donations from South Australian individuals and families and from organisations. It is one of the State Library's heritage collections and is of international importance.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nThe Library manages, in collaboration with the History Trust of South Australia, the Centre of Democracy on the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue. The Centre's gallery exhibits treasures from History Trust and State Library collections, as well as items on loan from State Records of South Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Courts Authority, Parliament House, Government House and private lenders.\n\n\n=== National edeposit system (NED) ===\nAs a member library of National and State Libraries Australia, the organisation collaborated on the creation of the National edeposit (NED) system, which enables publishers from all over Australia to upload electronic publications as per the 2016 amendment to the Copyright Act 1968 and other regional legislation relating to legal deposit, and makes these publications publicly accessible online (depending on access conditions) from anywhere via Trove.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSouth Australian Museum\nArt Gallery of South Australia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nState Library of South Australia",

        "wiki": "Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary is a marine protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located on the east coast of Gulf St Vincent in and adjoining the north-western part of the Adelaide metropolitan area and which was established in 2005 for the protection of a resident population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus).The sanctuary covers an area of coastline extending from Port Gawler in the north to North Haven in the south, and includes the waterways of the Port Adelaide River, the Barker Inlet and some associated channels, as well as Torrens and Garden Islands, and inlets on the Lefevre Peninsula such as Mutton Cove.  The habitat protected by the sanctuary consists of \u201cmangroves, seagrass, saltmarsh, tidal flats, tidal creeks and estuarine rivers.\u201d  As of 2014, it covered an area of 118.75 square kilometres (45.85 sq mi).The sanctuary was proclaimed in 2005 for the purpose of achieving the following two objects:\n\n(a) to protect the dolphin population of the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet; and\n(b) to protect the natural habitat of that population.\n\nThe sanctuary is also required to achieve the following six objectives:\n\n(a) the protection of the dolphin population of the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet from direct physical harm is to be maintained and improved;\n (b) the key habitat features in the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet that are necessary to sustain the dolphin population are to be maintained, protected and restored;\n (c) water quality within the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet should be improved to a level that sustains the ecological processes, environmental values and productive capacity of the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet;\n(d) the interests of the community are to be taken into account by recognising indigenous and other cultural, and historical, relationships with the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet and surrounding areas, and by ensuring appropriate participation in processes associated with the management of the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet;\n (e) public awareness of the importance of a healthy Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet to the economic, social and cultural prosperities of the local communities, and the community more generally, is to be promoted; \n (f) the principles of ecological sustainable development in relation to the use and management of the Port Adelaide River estuary and Barker Inlet are to be promoted. \n\nAs of June 2015, the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary was managed by the Department of Environment and Water  with assistance from other South Australian government agencies, local government and other organizations with responsibilities in respect to  the waters and land associated with the sanctuary or having an interest in such.  Management activity was supported by a community volunteer group known as the ADS Action Group which was created in 2012 and which had 50 registered volunteers in 2015.The Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary shares territory with the following protected areas \u2013 the Barker Inlet-St Kilda Aquatic Reserve, the Port Gawler Conservation Park, the majority of the St Kilda \u2013 Chapman Creek Aquatic Reserve and the Torrens Island Conservation Park.  It will also share territory with parts of the Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary yet to be proclaimed as of 27 October 2016 and which are located in localities and suburbs including Bolivar, Buckland Park, Dry Creek, Globe Derby Park, Port Gawler and St Kilda.The sanctuary also adjoins the Adelaide Metropolitan Beaches Restricted Area which extends from North Haven in the north along the Adelaide metropolitan coastline to Sellicks Beach in the south and which is described in the National Parks and Wildlife (Protected Animals\u2014Marine Mammals) Regulations 2010.  Both the sanctuary and the Adelaide Metropolitan Beaches Restricted Area are areas subject to the additional regulatory requirements regarding \u201ccommercial activities\u201d in respect to interaction with marine mammals including all species of dolphins present in South Australia.The sanctuary is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProtected areas of South Australia\nList of protected areas in Adelaide\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial webpage\nThe webpage for the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary on the Protected Planet website\nPort River Dolphins, Behind the News",

        "wiki": "St Peter's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in the South Australian capital of Adelaide. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Adelaide and Metropolitan of the Province of South Australia. The cathedral, a significant Adelaide landmark, is situated on approximately 1 acre (0.40 ha) of land at the corner of Pennington Terrace and King William Road in the suburb of North Adelaide.\nThe south front has similar features to the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the Church of St Jean-Baptiste de Belleville in Paris, including an ornate rose window above the main entrance which depicts stories of South Australia and the Bible.\n\n\n== Foundation and construction ==\n\nThe See of Adelaide was constituted in June 1847. As there was no cathedral, Trinity Church on North Terrace was denoted as the pro tempore cathedral church. Augustus Short, the first Bishop of Adelaide, held the first ordinations there on 29 June 1848 (St Peter's feast day). When Adelaide was surveyed by Colonel William Light over a decade before, land in Victoria Square had been set aside for public use. Bishop Short obtained a land grant in the square from Governor Robe in March 1848; the grant was registered on 23 April 1851. By late 1849 a subscription was bringing in funds for construction of a cathedral on the now cleared site. Around this time the legality of the land grant began to be publicly questioned. It was argued that the area was a public reserve and the governor had no power to issue such grants. To resolve matters Bishop Short, supported by the Synod, took the matter to the Supreme Court. The judgment in June 1855 confirmed that the grant was invalid and construction could not proceed.Bishop Short purchased just over an acre of land, on Pennington Terrace in North Adelaide, on 8 August 1862. He reported in 1868 that the funds gathered were sufficient and announced to the diocese's synod of his decision to begin construction of a cathedral. Bishop Short had William Butterfield design the cathedral, but the long communication gap between England and Adelaide contributed to delays and disagreement. Butterfield's plans were purchased and given to Edward John Woods, of Adelaide architectural firm Wright, Woods and Hamilton, for completion. Woods changed some of the plans' materials and design, while keeping the general details as Butterfield had proposed. Woods was noted by his colleague Walter Bagot as strongly influenced by French architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, and had imbued a French Gothic character in many elements of its design. Bishop Short laid the foundation stone, a 13 long hundredweight (0.7 t) block from Glen Ewin Quarry, on St Peter's Day 1869 in front of over a thousand people. Brown and Thompson contracted for the building work, which progressed slowly. The first service was held on St Peter's Day 1876, though the building was incomplete. Synod meetings and regular services began in May 1877.The women of the diocese had raised \u00a31,200 to purchase an organ which was installed in 1877. The first part of the cathedral was consecrated on 1 January 1878. By the time Bishop Short retired in late 1881, \u00a318,000 received from many donors had been spent. Much of the furnishing was also donated including stained glass windows, a marble font, the chancel's tessellated pavement and an altar. Work began again in 1890 during the tenure of Bishop George Wyndham Kennion. Governor the Earl of Kintore laid a foundation stone, 1.5 long tons (1.5 t) of Monarto South granite, on 27 September. The ceremony included Masonic Honors as the Governor was Grand Master of the South Australian Freemasons. The congregation raised funds and Woods was again contracted as architect. Over \u00a310,000 was spent beginning the two towers and the western part of the nave, and completing the northern porch. Building work ceased in 1894 when funds were exhausted and did not resume for some years.A \u00a34,000 bequest came from Sir Thomas Elder in 1897. This and other smaller amounts from offerings and gifts were added to the building fund. A tender was awarded in 1899 to complete the nave and bring the towers to roof height. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge donated \u00a31,000, conditional on completion of work by 1902, and in 1900 Robert Barr Smith donated \u00a310,000 to enable completion of the towers, spires and creation of an apse at the chancel end. The Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary) were present when the nave was consecrated and a Boer War memorial unveiled on 14 July 1901. A dedication ceremony for the towers and spires was held on 7 December 1902, and the last scaffolding removed two months later. The south porch and some temporary vestries were subsequently built, in addition to a crypt under the Lady chapel. A consecration ceremony was held on 7 April 1904; this marked completion of the cathedral's external structure. Records show that the work from the 1890s to date had cost somewhat over \u00a325,000.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe cathedral's interior is 203 feet (61.9 m) long of which the Lady chapel occupies ? and the nave and chancel the remainder. The nave is 59 feet (18.0 m) wide and, at the top of the spire's crosses, the cathedral rises 168 feet (51.2 m) from ground level. Hammer dressed Tea Tree Gully sandstone\u2014from what is now Anstey Hill Recreation Park\u2014 was used in the sanctuary, choir, transepts and part of the nave. Stone used for the quoins is lighter in colour and came from the same area as that used in the Adelaide Town Hall. The building's base and some of the interior uses stone from Glen Osmond in the Adelaide Hills. Other parts of the cathedral use stone from New Zealand, Pyrmont, New South Wales and Murray Bridge.A reredos\u2014a decorative structure behind the altar\u2014was installed in 1904. It was finished considerably later and dedicated on 6 March 1910 by Bishop Arthur Nutter Thomas. The reredos, containing 23 coloured and gilded panels plus carved figures, is 34 feet (10.4 m) high. This structure was built at St Sidwells Art Works, Tiverton, England to a design by T. H. Lyon. The reredos features Christ in the centre panel, with saints filling the surrounding niches. Four coloured panels below the figure of Christ depict events in the life of St Peter, the patron saint of the cathedral. The cathedral has significant fine-quality stained glass windows. James Powell and Sons made three that were unveiled in the Lady chapel in November 1900. The southern transept window is the largest stained glass window in the cathedral and was dedicated in August 1926. A window representing Saint Cecilia, patron saint of church music, was unveiled in 1876 in the pulpit side of the chancel, though by 1969 it was ironically concealed by the organ. Windows elsewhere were funded and influenced by bequests. Amongst these Charles Beaumont Howard's memory is commemorated by a window in the chancel, Sir Anthony Musgrave's daughter Joyce Harriet by one in the sacristy and churchman Richard Bowen Colley by another window in the chancel. The remains of the English biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher are interred within the cathedral.The stalls for the canons and choir, along with the original bishop's throne (now used as the dean's stall) and pulpit canopy, were a gift to the cathedral from Sir John Langdon Bonython in memory of his wife. Made in Adelaide in 1926, carvings can be seen on the capitals at each end of the stalls and also around the upper work in the canopies above.\nIn the western tower is the cathedral's ring of eight bells, hung for change ringing. Their purchase was funded by a bequest from cathedral warden Frederick Allen Wakeman. They were cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough England in 1946 and were dedicated by Bishop Robin on 29 June 1947. With the tenor (largest) bell weighing just over 41 long hundredweight (2.1 t) they are the heaviest ring of eight bells in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second heaviest ring of eight in the world after Sherborne Abbey in England. The bells are rung by members of The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers who also operate the Adelaide Ringing Centre of 8 dumb-bells for training which opened in 2012.\n\n\n== Music ==\nSt Peter's Cathedral has a long and distinguished musical reputation in Adelaide. St Peter's Cathedral Choir has been singing services in the cathedral for over 130 years. It is the only choir of children and adults of its type in Adelaide. Currently, the choir sings three choral services per week (Solemn Eucharist and Evensong every Sunday, plus Evensong on Wednesdays during school terms) in addition to regular concert performances and other special services. In 2006/7 and 2010/11, the choir toured internationally to the UK and Italy. In 2014/15, the choir undertook their third international tour to the UK and France.\n\n\n=== Directors of music and masters of the choristers ===\nHistorically, the Master of the Choristers was also the Cathedral Organist. In 1994, role was split, creating the positions of Director of Music and Organist.\n\n2020- present: Anthony Hunt\n1996\u20132020: Leonie Hempton OAM\n1994\u20131996: Peter Leech\n1963\u20131994: John David Swale AM\n1963\u20131964: Lyall Von Einem (acting)\n1955\u20131962: Jack Vernon Peters\n1936\u20131955: Rev. Horace Percy Finnis\n1891\u20131936: John Millard Dunn\n1876\u20131891: Arthur Boult\n\n\n=== Organists ===\n2018\u2013present: David Heah\n2015\u20132017: Joshua van Konkelenberg\n1999\u20132015: Shirley Gale\n1994\u20131999: John David Swale AM\n\n\n=== Organ ===\nThe cathedral's original organ was built by the London firm of Bishop & Son. It was installed in 1877 and dedicated on 1 January 1878. Located in what is now the sacristy, it was used for over fifty years before relocation in 1930 to St Augustine's Church in Unley, South Australia. The current organ was built by William Hill & Son and Norman & Beard of Melbourne and London and was dedicated on 29 July 1929. Until 2017, it remained largely unaltered, featuring electro-pneumatic action, four manuals and fifty speaking stops, featuring 26 couplers. Two additions were made, the addition of a Mixture V stop on the Great (1986) and the 32' Contra Trombone to the pedal division (1989). The lowest 12 pipes of this rank are located on a wall above the sacristy, opposite the main organ case. In 1963, a carved wooden case for the organ, designed by Walter Bagot, was only partly installed. In 2017/18, the instrument underwent major restoration and overhaul by Harrison & Harrison Ltd of Durham, UK. New mixtures were added to both the great and swell divisions, plus the addition of 8' and 4' principal stops in the pedal division. Some tonal irregularities dating from the 1980s were reversed, ensuring the instrument once again speaks and sounds to the original Hill, Norman and Beard specification. The console was also upgraded to include a capture system and modern playing aides, and the casework was completed, drawing inspiration from the original Bagot design. This work was completed at a cost of approx AU$1.5 million and the \"First Chords\" played on Advent Sunday 2 December 2018.\n\n\n== Clergy ==\nThe bishop of Adelaide was the formal rector of the cathedral until 1986. The cathedral was governed by the bishop with assistance from a dean (the dean of Adelaide) and chapter. The dean and chapter operated as an independent body, meaning they were not required to report to the synod of the Diocese of Adelaide. In 1986, the administrative functions of the dean and chapter were transferred to the cathedral council. Since 1986, the cathedral has been administrated as a parish with the dean (known as the dean of the cathedral) as rector. The dean of the cathedral is not synonymous with the dean of Adelaide (which has been vacant since 1997).\n\n\n=== Deans ===\n2012\u2013present: Frank Nelson (previously Dean of Wellington, New Zealand)\n2009\u20132011: Sarah Macneil (later Bishop of Grafton)\n2000\u20132008: Steven Ogden\n1999\u20132000: Stuart Smith (acting)\n1987\u20131998: David Richardson (later Dean of Melbourne and Anglican Ambassador to the Vatican)\n\n\n=== Bishop's vicar ===\n1982\u20131987: Keith Chittleborough\n1966\u20131982: Lionel Edward W.

        "wiki": "Carrick Hill is a publicly accessible historic property at the foot of the Adelaide Hills, in the suburb of Springfield, in South Australia. It was the Adelaide home of Sir Edward \"Bill\" Hayward and his wife Lady Ursula (n\u00e9e Barr-Smith), and contains a large collection of drawings, sculptures, antiques and paintings. Completed in 1939 and built in the style of an English manor, it is one of the few period homes in Australia to have survived with its grounds undiminished and most of its original contents intact.\nAfter being bequeathed to the state of South Australia upon Sir Edward's death in 1983, since 1985 it has been managed by the board of the Carrick Hill Trust, a statutory corporation which as of 2019 reports to the  Department of the Premier and Cabinet.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe nearly 40-hectare property was the wedding gift of Ursula's father to the Haywards. After their marriage in 1935 the couple spent a year-long honeymoon in Europe. They bought many of the furnishings for their new home, including an imposing staircase, at the sale of Beaudesert House in Staffordshire, England. Construction of Carrick House began in 1937 and was completed in 1939. During this time Lady Ursula designed the gardens.\nThe Haywards claimed a number of well-known artists as close friends, and some of their work features in the collection that fills the house. Ursula was an artist in her own right, and her work is also represented.\nCarrick Hill was bequeathed to the state on Sir Edward's death in 1983, his wife having predeceased him. The Carrick Hill Trust was established as a statutory body by the Carrick Hill Trust Act (1985), which reported to Arts SA (later Arts South Australia) from 1993 to 2018, when it started reporting directly to the Department of Premier and Cabinet. \nThe artist David Dridan, a personal friend of the Haywards, was a member of the Carrick Hill Interim Committee, and founding member of the Carrick Hill Trust.\n\n\n== 21st century use ==\nThe house and grounds are open to the public for most of the year, closing in July for maintenance. An admission charge applies to the house, but not the gardens. Carrick Hill regularly houses themed art exhibitions.\nOn 13 November 2005, it hosted a reunion picnic for former staff of John Martin's, which was for many years owned by the Hayward family. The event coincided with the opening of a social history exhibition entitled \"Johnnies Spirit of a State\" and was held on the weekend of the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, which was founded by Sir Edward.Carrick Hill has hosted exhibitions of works by notable Australian artists, built around the Hayward collection. Previous exhibitions have featured the work of William Dobell, Jeffrey Smart, Robert Hannaford and Adrian Feint.\nIn 2018, Carrick Hill hosted an exhibition of May Gibbs' illustrations and other artists working with Australian botanical subjects.The Carrick Hill Trust has set up the Australian Museum of Gardening in the historic building which displays the influences over the art of gardening in the past 250 years. The collection includes more than thousand gardening tools.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPostcards: Carrick Hill's French connection\n\n\n== External links ==\nCarrick HillOld website:\n\nUrsula Hayward\nHistory - includes information about Sir Edward",

          "The gardens, food at the cafe, the house and the tour were all wonderful. If I lived in Adelaide a picnic lunch in the gardens would be on my agenda often. The gardens are free, only the tour and food at the cafe take your money - your choice. Otherwise it can be a free day out",

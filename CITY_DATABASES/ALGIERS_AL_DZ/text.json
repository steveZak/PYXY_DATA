        "wiki": "The Maqam Echahid (Arabic: \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u064a\u062f\u200e, Arabic pronunciation: [m\u00e6k\u00e6\u02d0m elch\u00e6\u02d0hi\u02d0d], English: Martyrs' Memorial) is a concrete monument commemorating the Algerian war for independence. The monument was opened in 1982 on the 20th anniversary of Algeria's independence. It is fashioned in the shape of three standing palm leaves which shelter the \"Eternal Flame\" beneath. At the edge of each palm leaf stands a statue of a soldier, each representing a stage of Algeria's struggle.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Martyrs Memorial is located on the heights of Algiers, in the municipality of El Madania, west of the Bois des arcades, east of Diar el Mah\u00e7oul and north of the plaza shopping center Riadh El Feth. It overlooks the neighborhood of Hamma (common Belouizdad) and the Botanical Garden Hamma (known as Jardin d'essai) in the north. The monument has been erected on the site of an ancient military fort.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nConsisting of three stylized fins that join mid-height, the concrete monument built by the Canadian company Lavalin, based on a model produced in the Fine Art Institute of Algiers, under the leadership of Bashir Yelles, reaches a height of 92 metres (302 ft). Above the three supporting fins, at 14 metres (47 ft) from the ground, is an Islamic style turret with a diameter of 10 metres (33 ft) and a height of 7.6 metres (25 ft), topped by a dome of 6 metres (20 ft). It rests on an esplanade that burns an \"eternal flame\" and includes a crypt, an amphitheater and the National Museum of El Mujahid (underground).\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe project to build a memorial in memory of the dead from the War of Independence is the brainchild of President Houari Boumedienne. Its implementation was, however, completed under the presidency of his successor Chadli Bendjedid.\nThe company Lavalin is responsible of the studies and construction of the monument. Several Algerian artists involved, like the painter Bashir Yelles, the calligrapher Abdelhamid Skander and the Polish sculptor Marian Konieczny.\nThe completion of the work was a real technological challenge because of the constraints inherent to the geometry of the assembly, especially the curvature of the fins, the situation of the site at the edge of a steep cliff and high seismicity of the region. Pierre Lamarre, director of engineering and structural design, Claude Naud, expert planning and construction methods, along with Bashir Yelles, imagined a solution that proved itself decisive and innovative.\nSeven months (7 months and 20 day) (November 15, 1981 to July 5, 1982) were necessary to build this architectural work. The monument was inaugurated by the then President Chadli Bendjedid in February 1986.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlgerian war\nAzadi Tower\nPearl square\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "wiki": "Algiers ( al-JEERZ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u200e, romanized: Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir; French: Alger) is the capital and largest city of Algeria. The city's population at the 2008 Census was 2,988,145 and in 2011 was estimated to be around 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around 5,000,000. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean Sea and in the north-central portion of Algeria.Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the Mediterranean Sea. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the deys, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel, 122 metres (400 ft) above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city's name is derived via French and Catalan Alger from the Arabic name al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631), \"The Islands\". This name refers to the four former islands which lay off the city's coast before becoming part of the mainland in 1525. Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir is itself a truncated form of the city's older name Jaza\u02beir Ban\u012b Mazghanna (\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0632\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0629), \"The Islands of the Banu Mazghanna,Sons of Mazghana\", used by early medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi.\nIn antiquity, the Greeks knew the town as Ik\u00f3sion (Ancient Greek: \u1f38\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), which was Latinized as Icosium under Roman rule. The Greeks explained the name as coming from their word for \"twenty\" (\u03b5\u1f34\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9, e\u00edkosi), supposedly because it had been founded by 20 companions of Hercules when he visited the Atlas Mountains during his labors.Algiers is also known as el-Behdja (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629, \"The Joyous\") or \"Algiers the White\" (French: Alger la Blanche) for its whitewashed buildings, seen rising from the sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nA small Phoenician colony on Algiers's former islands was established and taken over by the Carthaginians sometime before the 3rd century BC. After the Punic Wars, the Romans eventually took over administration of the town, which they called Icosium. Its ruins now form part of the modern city's marine quarter, with the Rue de la Marine following a former Roman road. Roman cemeteries existed near Bab-el-Oued and Bab Azoun. The city was given Latin rights by the emperor Vespasian. The bishops of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century, but the ancient town fell into obscurity during the Muslim conquest of North Africa.\nThe present city was founded in 944 by Bologhine ibn Ziri, the founder of the Berber Zirid\u2013Sanhaja dynasty.  He had earlier (935) built his own house and a Sanhaja center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.  Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by Roger II of Sicily in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the Hammadids in 1014. The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the Almohads in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Ziyanid sultans of Tlemcen. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under amirs of its own due to Oran being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.The Pe\u00f1\u00f3n of Algiers, an islet in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by the Spaniards as early as 1302. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and Spain. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Pe\u00f1on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nIn 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the Capture of Algiers (1516). Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the Fall of Tlemcen (1517), was the founder of the pashaluk, which subsequently became the beylik, of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the Capture of Algiers (1529), and then formally invited the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlgiers from this time became the chief seat of the Barbary pirates. In October 1541 in the Algiers expedition, the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their Pasha, Hassan.\n\nFormally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. The United States fought two wars (the First and Second Barbary Wars) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.\nAmong the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes, who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period. The primary source for knowledge of Algiers of this period, since there are no contemporary local sources, is the Topograf\u00eda e historia general de Argel (1612, but written earlier), published by Diego de Haedo, but whose authorship is disputed. This work describes in detail the city, the behavior of its inhabitants, and its military defenses, with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by Spain so as to end the piracy.\nA significant number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to Islam, many fleeing the law or other problems at home. Once converted to Islam, they were safe in Algiers. Many occupied positions of authority, such as Samson Rowlie, an Englishman who became Treasurer of Algiers.The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of Andalusian, Jewish, Moorish and Kabyle communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Ottoman Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under Lord Exmouth (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715), assisted by Dutch men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nThe history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of Algeria and its relationship to France. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul\u2014whom the dey had hit with a fly-whisk when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants\u2014a French army under General de Bourmont attacked the city in the 1830 invasion of Algiers. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of French Algeria.\nMany Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population. During the 1930s, the architect Le Corbusier drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as \"nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot\". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which \"the 'civilised' live like rats in holes\" whereas \"the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being\". However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.\nDuring World War II, Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during Operation Torch.\n\nIn 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and Pieds-Noirs) during fighting between the French Army and the Algerian Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale, Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire pied-noir population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding Mitidja plain.\n\n\n=== Algerian War ===\n\nAlgiers also played a pivotal role in the Algerian War (1954\u20131962), particularly during the Battle of Algiers when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (who authorized any means \"to eliminate the insurrectionists\"), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the Fourth Republic in France, as well as the return of General de Gaulle to power.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nAlgeria achieved independence on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a real democracy baptized the \"Spring of Algier\". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.\n\n\n=== Crisis of the 1990s ===\nThe city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the Islamic Salvation Front engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a civil war between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.\nOn December 11, 2007, two car bombs exploded in Algiers. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll was at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks. However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day. As of 2008, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.Indigenous terrorist groups have been actively operating in Algeria since around 2002.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Districts of Algiers ===\n\nThe Casbah (of  Al Qasbah, \u201cthe Citadel\u201d), Ier District of Algiers: called  Al-Djaza\u00efr Al Mahroussa  (\u201cWell Kept Algiers\u201d), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K\u00e9bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by Almoravid Youssef Ibn Tachfin and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra\u00efs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J\u00e9nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque, and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.\n Bab El Oued: Literally the River's Gate, the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond \"the gate of the river\". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with \u201cthe three clocks\u201d and for its \u201cmarket Triplet\u201d, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.\n Edge of sea: from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard Che Guevara (formerly the Boulevard of the Republic).\n Kouba (will daira of Hussein-dey): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.\nEl Harrach, a suburb of Algiers, is located about 10 kilometres (6 miles) to the east of the city.\nThe communes of Hydra, Ben Aknoun, El-Biar and Bouzareah form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the \"Heights of Algiers\". These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.\nThe  Didouche Mourad street is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the Grande Post office to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the place Audin, the Faculty of Algiers, The Crowned Heart and the park of Galland. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlgiers has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). Its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior. Algiers on average receives roughly 600 millimetres (24 in) of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean Spain, and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean France, as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate.\nSnow is very rare; in 2012, the city received 100 millimetres (4 in) of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years.\n\n\n== Government ==\nSee also: Algiers politics and administration (fr) and List of mayors of AlgiersThe city (and province) of Algiers is composed of 13 administrative districts, sub-divided into 57 communes listed below with their populations at the 1998 and 2008 Censuses:\n\n\n== Local architecture ==\n\nThere are many public buildings of interest, including the whole Kasbah quarter, Martyrs Square (Sahat ech-Chouhada \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0621), the government offices (formerly the British consulate), the \"Grand\", \"New\", and Ketchaoua Mosques, the Roman Catholic cathedral of Notre Dame d'Afrique, the Bardo Museum, the old Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale d'Alger\u2014a Turkish palace built in 1799\u20131800\u2014and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the British Library.\nThe main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into barracks, and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a minaret and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.Djamaa el Kebir (Jamaa-el-Kebir \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (minbar \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of Tlemcen, in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by Moorish arches.The New Mosque (Jamaa-el-Jedid \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is 27 metres (89 ft) high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the rue d'Isly near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in Ireland, sacked Baltimore, and enslaved its inhabitants.\n\nThe Ketchaoua mosque (Djamaa Ketchaoua \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0648\u0629), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a portico supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of Moorish plaster work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of San Geronimo. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and Byzantine styles.\nAlgiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The Bardo Museum holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial\u2014the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of 95 hectares (235 acres). An opening in the south jetty affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a mole. The lighthouse which occupies the site of Fort Penon was built in 1544.Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a rampart, parapet and ditch, with two terminal forts, Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646 to the south and Bab-el-Oued \u0627\u062f to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of Bouzareah \u0628\u0648\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 (at an elevation of 396 metres (1,299 ft) above the sea) took their place.Notre Dame d'Afrique, a church built (1858\u20131872) in a mixture of the Roman and Byzantine styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the Bouzareah hills, 3 km (2 mi)\nto the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the Virgin depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the archangel Michael, belonging to the confraternity of Neapolitan fishermen.Villa Abd-el-Tif, former residence of the dey, was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the Abd-el-Tif prize, among whom Maurice Boitel, for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nNotre Dame d'Afrique, accessible by one cable car, is one of the city's most outstanding monuments: located in the district of Z' will ghara, the basilica was built around 1858.\nMonument des Martyrs (Marquand E' chahid): an iconic concrete monument commemorating the Algerian war for independence. The monument was opened in 1982 on the 20th anniversary of Algeria's independence. It is fashioned in the shape of three standing palm leaves which shelter the \"Eternal Flame\" beneath. At the edge of each palm leaf stands a statue of a soldier, each representing a stage of Algeria's struggle.\nThe El Jedid mosque at the Place des Martyrs near the port.\nPlace of the Emir Abdelkader (formerly Bugeaud): in memory of the famous emir Abd El-Kader, resistant during French conquest of Algeria.\nGrand Post Office (1910, by Voinot and Tondoire): construction of the neo-Moorish type which is in full centre town of Algiers.\nThe Jardin d'essai (Garden of Test; El-Hamma): situated in the east of Algiers, it extends over 80 hectares (198 acres) and contains exotic plants and gardens. It was created in 1832 by A.

The city has the highest cost of living of any city in North Africa, as well as the 50th highest worldwide, as of March 2007, having gained one position compared to the previous year.Mohamed Ben Ali El Abbar, president of the Council of Administration of the Emirate Group EMAAR, presented five \"megaprojects\" to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, during a ceremony which took place Saturday, July 15, within the Palace of the People of Algiers. These projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area and restoration and leisure facilities.\nThe first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station \"Aga\" located in the downtown area. The ultramodern station intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.\nThe second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the 44 km (27 mi) sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea.

The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments.

On 14 May 1962 over 300 works of art were brought to the Louvre in Paris from the Museum. \n\n\n== National Museum of Fine Arts of Algiers and Algerian Independence ==\nThe Museum of Fine Arts came under threat as independence approached. As part of their campaign of destabilization, on 26 November 1961 Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te (OAS) commandos bombed a statue by Antoine Bourdelle in the courtyard of the museum causing damage to the museum's first floor as well as the statue. Additionally there was a fear among French cultural authorities that strict Islamists would take offense to nudes kept in the museum and/or that post-independence rioting and looting would affect the museum. French authorities saw the immediate danger posed by the OAS and apparent danger of anarchy (the museum experienced a peaceful transition) as a reason to move the works of art in secret, under military escort first to Marseille and finally to the Louvre in Paris. The works were valued at the time to be worth, in today's dollars $50 million. However, despite close ties with the museum, no cultural representatives of the FLN, or indeed workers at the museum were informed of the transfer when it occurred and only discovered the missing pieces when they found empty frames. When the missing works were discovered the Fine Arts Museums director, Jean de Maisonseul informed the French. This shipment included works by such artists as Monet, Delacroix and Courbet. The negotiations over returning the art, and whether it should indeed be returned to Algeria were a contentious issue in France and a cause of outrage in Algeria. Under the Evian accords of March 1962 it was agreed that all institutions and infrastructure which had under colonial administration been financed by the autonomous colonial administration in Algeria would remain under the control of the Algerian State. The argument of the Algerian negotiators for this technicality was that these institutions, museums included had been financed from the resources produced by the Algerian land and its people. Both the head of the Louvre and of the curator of the Museum of Fine Arts (who remained the same as under French administration) worked to bring the works back under Algerian control. The Director of France's museums Henri Seyrig argued that returning the work, in accord with the Evian Agreements would continue to remind Algerians of their ties to France and would follow a foreign policy brief stating an intention to \"foster the most extensive audience for our culture\" as an extension of politics by other means. while the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michel Debr\u00e9 saw it as France's cultural property, and a part of its territory that must be returned. Negotiations began in May 1967 and by 1970, over the protests of the Minister Michel Debr\u00e9, the works were repatriated to Algeria. Cooperation between museum officials was one of the few examples of goodwill negotiating on both sides.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\nThe paintings department has European paintings of 14th- to mid-20th-century paintings. They are arranged chronologically and by major schools in 35 rooms. The collection features :\n\nAlfred Sisley, The Canal du Loing in Winter\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Algeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.musee-beauxarts.dz/",

          "Honestly, this museum was much better than I expected. And for a ridiculously cheap entry (1 euro). OK, nobody would be any worse for it if they had more English explanations next to Arabic and French, but then again, do you expect an odd Rodin, Gaugin or even Picasso in",
          "The museum appeared small at first but turned out to be fairly large with a varied collection. The building is very nice and the view from the terrace is great. Ticket price is very cheap.",
          "I went here based on trip advisor. I walked up from the gardens which took about 10 mins. There was no English text (Arabic and French) which is fine - what do I expect? The thing that bothered me was the layout - there was no structure or signage, I just happened tontine",
          "The location of the museum is already spectacular: overlooking a french style garden with fountains and manicured lawns with a view down to the ocean. Then the building itself, set in a lush garden sporting high ceilings and mosaic floors and a panorama roof terrace, is a sight",
          "The museum is full of history, rich in culture, a must visit to understand best the revolution in Algeria",
          "The perfect walk in the park the Algerian way. Lovely place, beautiful sightseeing, simply unique. A Must.",
          "Nice inner city place to walk and get some fresh air, plant and trees are not well taken care of but generally clean. There is a zoo near the entrance, I'm not a fan of looking up animals so I didn't visit.",
          "This is a very well stocked and curated art gallery - quite a pleasant surprise. Some interesting modern art and an outstanding collection of bronzes.",
          "Beautiful building containing a large collection of mostly French impressionist and modern paintings and sculptures: Pisarro, Degas, Rodin, Monet, and many more. Also some small Buddhas from former French colonies of Laos and Cambodia, and porcelain from China and France.",
          "My sister-in-law took us for a visit at the Musee. Don't turn around if you arrive at a closed gate, the small door to the right is open and once we peeked in and said bonjour, the gate was opened for us. A lovely, polite gentleman admitted us and gave us a brief overview. He",
          "its amazing place have being visited by any Algerian or Tourists,its a great museum.It reflicts the actuality if and legendary of Algeria",
          "A lovely Museum in an exceptionally rich and beautiful natural park, surrounded by amazing trees in the center of Algiers. Visitors can spend hours without noticing the time. A must while visiting Algiers.",
          "Feels like an opportunity missed. There are some nice Algerian paintings, but some lesser French ones and some fairly ordinary bits of furniture.",
          "The collection of art and sculpture here is actually quite decent, considering that you're in Algiers and not Paris. Photos inside are discouraged, but you can probably get away with taking a few quick pics as there aren't too many people supervising activity. The view out over",
          "Across the street from the Jardin, this museum is worth an hour. Lots of stairs and no elevators so not for the faint of heart or the feeble. Some beautiful sculptures but otherwise it was just so-so. Great view of the port.",
          "Very cool place to see amazing waterfront tile work in a historical home or building. You'll want a home just like this!",
          "Package this in with a half day trip to le jardin d'essai. Explore the park and zoo and then walk up the stairs to the museum. Here you will feel the history of French Algeria and the desire of the French that Algeria should truly be a department of Metropolitan France. It was",
          "The museum is located close to the botanic garden \"Jardin d'essai\" that you can overlook from the museum itself. it's also very close to the Sofitel Algiers. The collection is very rich with pieces of Issiakhem, Racim, Dinet Delacroix, Degas, ... Very unfortunately, the museum",
          "The \"Beaux Arts\" museum is not what one would expect when they think of Algeria. Housed in a beautiful building which overlooks wonderful gardens, the Beaux Arts looks more like it could be The Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia; impressionist paintings grouped in what seems like",
          "Below the hill of the Martyrs Monument stands the Museum of Fine Arts in Algiers. Having visited a number of times, this museum goes from strength to strength. When I first arrived they had I think 1-2 Degas sculptures amongst others just sitting on a plinth, no glass"

It was opened as a museum in 1927.Nothing specific is known about this residence, formerly in the countryside and now encompassed in the modern city. H. Klein tells us that the palace was built in the eighteenth century and that it would have been the property of Prince Omar before the French conquest. A document, in the form of a drawing signed by Captain Longuemare, specifies that it was Mustapha ben Omar who was a very rich Tunisian. In 1926, the Bardo Palace was ceded to the Domains by Mrs Fr\u00e9mont, sister and heiress of Pierre Joret.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Algeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBardo National Museum (Archive) (in French)\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130721142135/http://lebardo.info/",

        "wiki": "Algiers ( al-JEERZ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u200e, romanized: Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir; French: Alger) is the capital and largest city of Algeria. The city's population at the 2008 Census was 2,988,145 and in 2011 was estimated to be around 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around 5,000,000. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean Sea and in the north-central portion of Algeria.Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the Mediterranean Sea. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the deys, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel, 122 metres (400 ft) above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city's name is derived via French and Catalan Alger from the Arabic name al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631), \"The Islands\". This name refers to the four former islands which lay off the city's coast before becoming part of the mainland in 1525. Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir is itself a truncated form of the city's older name Jaza\u02beir Ban\u012b Mazghanna (\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0632\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0629), \"The Islands of the Banu Mazghanna,Sons of Mazghana\", used by early medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi.\nIn antiquity, the Greeks knew the town as Ik\u00f3sion (Ancient Greek: \u1f38\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), which was Latinized as Icosium under Roman rule. The Greeks explained the name as coming from their word for \"twenty\" (\u03b5\u1f34\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9, e\u00edkosi), supposedly because it had been founded by 20 companions of Hercules when he visited the Atlas Mountains during his labors.Algiers is also known as el-Behdja (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629, \"The Joyous\") or \"Algiers the White\" (French: Alger la Blanche) for its whitewashed buildings, seen rising from the sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nA small Phoenician colony on Algiers's former islands was established and taken over by the Carthaginians sometime before the 3rd century BC. After the Punic Wars, the Romans eventually took over administration of the town, which they called Icosium. Its ruins now form part of the modern city's marine quarter, with the Rue de la Marine following a former Roman road. Roman cemeteries existed near Bab-el-Oued and Bab Azoun. The city was given Latin rights by the emperor Vespasian. The bishops of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century, but the ancient town fell into obscurity during the Muslim conquest of North Africa.\nThe present city was founded in 944 by Bologhine ibn Ziri, the founder of the Berber Zirid\u2013Sanhaja dynasty.  He had earlier (935) built his own house and a Sanhaja center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.  Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by Roger II of Sicily in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the Hammadids in 1014. The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the Almohads in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Ziyanid sultans of Tlemcen. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under amirs of its own due to Oran being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.The Pe\u00f1\u00f3n of Algiers, an islet in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by the Spaniards as early as 1302. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and Spain. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Pe\u00f1on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nIn 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the Capture of Algiers (1516). Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the Fall of Tlemcen (1517), was the founder of the pashaluk, which subsequently became the beylik, of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the Capture of Algiers (1529), and then formally invited the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlgiers from this time became the chief seat of the Barbary pirates. In October 1541 in the Algiers expedition, the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their Pasha, Hassan.\n\nFormally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. The United States fought two wars (the First and Second Barbary Wars) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.\nAmong the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes, who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period. The primary source for knowledge of Algiers of this period, since there are no contemporary local sources, is the Topograf\u00eda e historia general de Argel (1612, but written earlier), published by Diego de Haedo, but whose authorship is disputed. This work describes in detail the city, the behavior of its inhabitants, and its military defenses, with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by Spain so as to end the piracy.\nA significant number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to Islam, many fleeing the law or other problems at home. Once converted to Islam, they were safe in Algiers. Many occupied positions of authority, such as Samson Rowlie, an Englishman who became Treasurer of Algiers.The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of Andalusian, Jewish, Moorish and Kabyle communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Ottoman Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under Lord Exmouth (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715), assisted by Dutch men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nThe history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of Algeria and its relationship to France. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul\u2014whom the dey had hit with a fly-whisk when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants\u2014a French army under General de Bourmont attacked the city in the 1830 invasion of Algiers. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of French Algeria.\nMany Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population. During the 1930s, the architect Le Corbusier drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as \"nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot\". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which \"the 'civilised' live like rats in holes\" whereas \"the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being\". However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.\nDuring World War II, Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during Operation Torch.\n\nIn 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and Pieds-Noirs) during fighting between the French Army and the Algerian Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale, Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire pied-noir population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding Mitidja plain.\n\n\n=== Algerian War ===\n\nAlgiers also played a pivotal role in the Algerian War (1954\u20131962), particularly during the Battle of Algiers when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (who authorized any means \"to eliminate the insurrectionists\"), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the Fourth Republic in France, as well as the return of General de Gaulle to power.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nAlgeria achieved independence on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a real democracy baptized the \"Spring of Algier\". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.\n\n\n=== Crisis of the 1990s ===\nThe city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the Islamic Salvation Front engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a civil war between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.\nOn December 11, 2007, two car bombs exploded in Algiers. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll was at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks. However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day. As of 2008, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.Indigenous terrorist groups have been actively operating in Algeria since around 2002.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Districts of Algiers ===\n\nThe Casbah (of  Al Qasbah, \u201cthe Citadel\u201d), Ier District of Algiers: called  Al-Djaza\u00efr Al Mahroussa  (\u201cWell Kept Algiers\u201d), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K\u00e9bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by Almoravid Youssef Ibn Tachfin and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra\u00efs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J\u00e9nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque, and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.\n Bab El Oued: Literally the River's Gate, the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond \"the gate of the river\". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with \u201cthe three clocks\u201d and for its \u201cmarket Triplet\u201d, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.\n Edge of sea: from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard Che Guevara (formerly the Boulevard of the Republic).\n Kouba (will daira of Hussein-dey): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.\nEl Harrach, a suburb of Algiers, is located about 10 kilometres (6 miles) to the east of the city.\nThe communes of Hydra, Ben Aknoun, El-Biar and Bouzareah form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the \"Heights of Algiers\". These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.\nThe  Didouche Mourad street is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the Grande Post office to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the place Audin, the Faculty of Algiers, The Crowned Heart and the park of Galland. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlgiers has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). Its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior. Algiers on average receives roughly 600 millimetres (24 in) of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean Spain, and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean France, as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate.\nSnow is very rare; in 2012, the city received 100 millimetres (4 in) of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years.\n\n\n== Government ==\nSee also: Algiers politics and administration (fr) and List of mayors of AlgiersThe city (and province) of Algiers is composed of 13 administrative districts, sub-divided into 57 communes listed below with their populations at the 1998 and 2008 Censuses:\n\n\n== Local architecture ==\n\nThere are many public buildings of interest, including the whole Kasbah quarter, Martyrs Square (Sahat ech-Chouhada \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0621), the government offices (formerly the British consulate), the \"Grand\", \"New\", and Ketchaoua Mosques, the Roman Catholic cathedral of Notre Dame d'Afrique, the Bardo Museum, the old Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale d'Alger\u2014a Turkish palace built in 1799\u20131800\u2014and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the British Library.\nThe main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into barracks, and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a minaret and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.Djamaa el Kebir (Jamaa-el-Kebir \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (minbar \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of Tlemcen, in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by Moorish arches.The New Mosque (Jamaa-el-Jedid \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is 27 metres (89 ft) high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the rue d'Isly near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in Ireland, sacked Baltimore, and enslaved its inhabitants.\n\nThe Ketchaoua mosque (Djamaa Ketchaoua \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0648\u0629), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a portico supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of Moorish plaster work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of San Geronimo. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and Byzantine styles.\nAlgiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The Bardo Museum holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial\u2014the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of 95 hectares (235 acres). An opening in the south jetty affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a mole. The lighthouse which occupies the site of Fort Penon was built in 1544.Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a rampart, parapet and ditch, with two terminal forts, Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646 to the south and Bab-el-Oued \u0627\u062f to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of Bouzareah \u0628\u0648\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 (at an elevation of 396 metres (1,299 ft) above the sea) took their place.Notre Dame d'Afrique, a church built (1858\u20131872) in a mixture of the Roman and Byzantine styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the Bouzareah hills, 3 km (2 mi)\nto the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the Virgin depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the archangel Michael, belonging to the confraternity of Neapolitan fishermen.Villa Abd-el-Tif, former residence of the dey, was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the Abd-el-Tif prize, among whom Maurice Boitel, for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nNotre Dame d'Afrique, accessible by one cable car, is one of the city's most outstanding monuments: located in the district of Z' will ghara, the basilica was built around 1858.\nMonument des Martyrs (Marquand E' chahid): an iconic concrete monument commemorating the Algerian war for independence. The monument was opened in 1982 on the 20th anniversary of Algeria's independence. It is fashioned in the shape of three standing palm leaves which shelter the \"Eternal Flame\" beneath. At the edge of each palm leaf stands a statue of a soldier, each representing a stage of Algeria's struggle.\nThe El Jedid mosque at the Place des Martyrs near the port.\nPlace of the Emir Abdelkader (formerly Bugeaud): in memory of the famous emir Abd El-Kader, resistant during French conquest of Algeria.\nGrand Post Office (1910, by Voinot and Tondoire): construction of the neo-Moorish type which is in full centre town of Algiers.\nThe Jardin d'essai (Garden of Test; El-Hamma): situated in the east of Algiers, it extends over 80 hectares (198 acres) and contains exotic plants and gardens. It was created in 1832 by A. Hardy.\nVilla Abd-el-Hair, with the top of the Garden of test, one of the old residences of the dey, where until 1962, were placed the artists prizes winner of Price Abd-el-Hair, and in particular Maurice Boitel and Andre Hamburg.\nCitadel.\nRiadh El-Feth (shopping centre and art gallery).\nKetchaoua Mosque (This mosque became the Saint-Philippe cathedral during colonization before becoming again a mosque).\nNational Library, is in the district of El HAMMA and was built in the 1990s.\nDjamaa el Kebir at the Rue de la Marine.

The city has the highest cost of living of any city in North Africa, as well as the 50th highest worldwide, as of March 2007, having gained one position compared to the previous year.Mohamed Ben Ali El Abbar, president of the Council of Administration of the Emirate Group EMAAR, presented five \"megaprojects\" to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, during a ceremony which took place Saturday, July 15, within the Palace of the People of Algiers. These projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area and restoration and leisure facilities.\nThe first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station \"Aga\" located in the downtown area. The ultramodern station intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.\nThe second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the 44 km (27 mi) sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.\n\nThe third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of \"city of wellness\". El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be \"agreeable for all those which will want to combine tourism and well-being or tourism and relaxation\". The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.\nAnother project relates to technological implantation of a campus in Sidi Abdellah, 25 km (16 mi) south-east from Algiers. This 90 hectares (222 acres) site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels. Two other residential zones, including 1.800 apartments and 40 high standard villas, will be built on the surrounding hills.\nThe fifth project is that of the tourist complex Colonel Abb\u00e8s, which will be located 25 km (16 mi) west from Algiers. This complex will include several retail zones, meeting places, and residential zones composed of apartments and villas with views of the sea.There is another project under construction, by the name of Algiers Medina. The first step of the project is nearly complete.\nA Hewlett Packard office for French-speaking countries in Africa is in Algiers.\n\n\n== Tourist installations ==\n\nSome 20 km (12 mi) to the west of Algiers are such seaside resorts as Sidi Fredj (ex-Sidi Ferruch), Palm Beach, Douaouda, Z\u00e9ralda, and the  Club of the Pines  (residence of State); there are tourist complexes, Algerian and other restaurants, souvenir shops, supervised beaches, and other amenities. The city is also equipped with important hotel complexes such as the hotel Hilton, El-Aurassi or El Djazair. Algiers also has the first water park in the country. The tourism of Algiers is growing but is not as developed as that of the larger cities in Morocco or Tunisia.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe presence of a large diplomatic community in Algiers prompted the creation of multiple international educational institutions. These schools include :\n\nAmerican International School of Algiers;\nEl Kalimat School (English-language school);\nLyc\u00e9e International Alexandre-Dumas d'Alger (French school);\nRoma Italian School of Algiers;\nRussian Embassy School in Algiers.There was formerly the \u00c9cole japonaise d'Alger (\u30a2\u30eb\u30b8\u30a7\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821 Aruje Nihonjin Gakk\u014d), a school for Japanese children.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nETUSA (urban and suburban bus transportation for Algiers) operates bus service in Algiers and the surrounding suburbs. 54 lines are operating, with service from 5:30 a.m. to 12:45 a.m.\nSNTF (national railroad company) operates commuter-rail lines connecting the capital to the surrounding suburbs.\nAlgiers Metro, opened November 1, 2011.\nAlgiers tramway, opened on May 8, 2011.\nHouari Boumediene Airport is located 20 km (12 mi) from the city.

          "one of the most beautiful castles of Algiers. Built by the Ottomans during their long reign over the region, it has moor, french, and italian influences. It's construction material came from different parts of the world (usually looted by the famous barbary pirates or paid as a",
          "At the entrance, I didn't expect much looking from the outside but once entering the palace I was in awe by the interior of the hand painted tiles, ceilings and what not the design of the building. Take a slow walk around to immerse yourself inside which has so much cultural",

          "Beautifully restored complex of Moorish buildings. This was where the Ottoman Dey lived when Algeria was part of their empire. Then it was visibly part of the lower Casbah but a large amount of this area was destroyed by the French and so it became isolated. Its pretty amazing",
          "This is a complex made up of several old houses, with interesting displays, views over the harbour, and a good museum shop. Strongly recommended.",
          "If you wanna visit a typical Algerian Palace , The bastion 23 will amaze you, every single room every single square meter will transport you a hundreds years ago.",

          "It doesn't look like much from outside - but the interior is a dream. Typical moorish palaces each build around a patio adorned with stone pillars vaulted and painted ceilings and countless hand painted tiles, wooden lattice work and what not. Think Shehrazade and 2001 nights!",

          "old palace, but, basically, it's just a lot of empty rooms. No guides waiting to explain it. A few info boards here and there. But a prime example of tourism in Algeria - little effort made, and a chance missed",

          "well situated, and near the Casbah. The rooms are empty letting you imaginating the deco and the inhabitant of that time. the Palace has a wonderful view on the mediteranean see. The architecture is just amazing and unique. The roofs of some rooms are well kept and you for one",

        "wiki": "Notre Dame d'Afrique (Our Lady of Africa) is a Catholic basilica in Algiers, Algeria.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was Louis-Antoine-Augustin Pavy, who served as the Bishop of Algiers from 1846 to 1866, who paved the way for its construction. The basilica was inaugurated in 1872, after fourteen years of construction. It was founded by Charles Lavigerie. Its architect, Jean-Eug\u00e8ne Fromageau, who had been appointed the chief architect for ecclesiastical buildings in French Algeria in 1859, employed a Neo-Byzantine style. Its floor plan is unusual as the choir is situated on the southeast instead of the usual east side of the building.The basilica contains 46 stained glass windows installed in the 19th century. They were blown out during a bombing of the area in April 1943 and have been restored twice since the end of World War II.In 1930 an organ, built in 1911, was donated to the basilica by the wife of the late Albert Weddell, a wealthy English resident in Algiers at Villa Georges and friend of the French composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns who had inaugurated the organ at Weddell's home. \nThe basilica was damaged by the 2003 Boumerd\u00e8s earthquake. A reconstruction project was initiated by Archbishop Henri Teissier in 2003, but work on the project didn't start until the spring of 2007. The total cost of restoration was 5.1 million euros. The project took three years to complete.\n\n\n== Location ==\nNotre Dame d'Afrique is on the north side of Algiers, on a 124 m (407 ft) cliff overlooking the Bay of Algiers. It formerly could be reached from the city centre by a cable car. It can be considered to be the counter-piece to the church of Notre-Dame de la Garde on the other side of the Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Importance ==\nIts symbolic and religious importance can be summed up by the inscription on the apse: Notre Dame d'Afrique priez pour nous et pour les Musulmans (\"Our Lady of Africa, pray for us and for the Muslims\").\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to Notre Dame d'Afrique at Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Cemetery, with Chapel, Algiers, Algeria",

        "wiki": "Algiers ( al-JEERZ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u200e, romanized: Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir; French: Alger) is the capital and largest city of Algeria. The city's population at the 2008 Census was 2,988,145 and in 2011 was estimated to be around 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around 5,000,000. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean Sea and in the north-central portion of Algeria.Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the Mediterranean Sea. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the deys, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel, 122 metres (400 ft) above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city's name is derived via French and Catalan Alger from the Arabic name al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631), \"The Islands\". This name refers to the four former islands which lay off the city's coast before becoming part of the mainland in 1525. Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir is itself a truncated form of the city's older name Jaza\u02beir Ban\u012b Mazghanna (\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0632\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0629), \"The Islands of the Banu Mazghanna,Sons of Mazghana\", used by early medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi.\nIn antiquity, the Greeks knew the town as Ik\u00f3sion (Ancient Greek: \u1f38\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), which was Latinized as Icosium under Roman rule. The Greeks explained the name as coming from their word for \"twenty\" (\u03b5\u1f34\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9, e\u00edkosi), supposedly because it had been founded by 20 companions of Hercules when he visited the Atlas Mountains during his labors.Algiers is also known as el-Behdja (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629, \"The Joyous\") or \"Algiers the White\" (French: Alger la Blanche) for its whitewashed buildings, seen rising from the sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nA small Phoenician colony on Algiers's former islands was established and taken over by the Carthaginians sometime before the 3rd century BC. After the Punic Wars, the Romans eventually took over administration of the town, which they called Icosium. Its ruins now form part of the modern city's marine quarter, with the Rue de la Marine following a former Roman road. Roman cemeteries existed near Bab-el-Oued and Bab Azoun. The city was given Latin rights by the emperor Vespasian. The bishops of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century, but the ancient town fell into obscurity during the Muslim conquest of North Africa.\nThe present city was founded in 944 by Bologhine ibn Ziri, the founder of the Berber Zirid\u2013Sanhaja dynasty.  He had earlier (935) built his own house and a Sanhaja center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.  Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by Roger II of Sicily in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the Hammadids in 1014. The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the Almohads in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Ziyanid sultans of Tlemcen. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under amirs of its own due to Oran being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.The Pe\u00f1\u00f3n of Algiers, an islet in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by the Spaniards as early as 1302. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and Spain. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Pe\u00f1on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nIn 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the Capture of Algiers (1516). Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the Fall of Tlemcen (1517), was the founder of the pashaluk, which subsequently became the beylik, of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the Capture of Algiers (1529), and then formally invited the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlgiers from this time became the chief seat of the Barbary pirates. In October 1541 in the Algiers expedition, the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their Pasha, Hassan.\n\nFormally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. The United States fought two wars (the First and Second Barbary Wars) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.\nAmong the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes, who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period. The primary source for knowledge of Algiers of this period, since there are no contemporary local sources, is the Topograf\u00eda e historia general de Argel (1612, but written earlier), published by Diego de Haedo, but whose authorship is disputed. This work describes in detail the city, the behavior of its inhabitants, and its military defenses, with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by Spain so as to end the piracy.\nA significant number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to Islam, many fleeing the law or other problems at home. Once converted to Islam, they were safe in Algiers. Many occupied positions of authority, such as Samson Rowlie, an Englishman who became Treasurer of Algiers.The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of Andalusian, Jewish, Moorish and Kabyle communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Ottoman Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under Lord Exmouth (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715), assisted by Dutch men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nThe history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of Algeria and its relationship to France. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul\u2014whom the dey had hit with a fly-whisk when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants\u2014a French army under General de Bourmont attacked the city in the 1830 invasion of Algiers. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of French Algeria.\nMany Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population. During the 1930s, the architect Le Corbusier drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as \"nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot\". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which \"the 'civilised' live like rats in holes\" whereas \"the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being\". However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.\nDuring World War II, Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during Operation Torch.\n\nIn 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and Pieds-Noirs) during fighting between the French Army and the Algerian Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale, Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire pied-noir population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding Mitidja plain.\n\n\n=== Algerian War ===\n\nAlgiers also played a pivotal role in the Algerian War (1954\u20131962), particularly during the Battle of Algiers when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (who authorized any means \"to eliminate the insurrectionists\"), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the Fourth Republic in France, as well as the return of General de Gaulle to power.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nAlgeria achieved independence on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a real democracy baptized the \"Spring of Algier\". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.\n\n\n=== Crisis of the 1990s ===\nThe city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the Islamic Salvation Front engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a civil war between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.\nOn December 11, 2007, two car bombs exploded in Algiers. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll was at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks. However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day. As of 2008, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.Indigenous terrorist groups have been actively operating in Algeria since around 2002.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Districts of Algiers ===\n\nThe Casbah (of  Al Qasbah, \u201cthe Citadel\u201d), Ier District of Algiers: called  Al-Djaza\u00efr Al Mahroussa  (\u201cWell Kept Algiers\u201d), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K\u00e9bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by Almoravid Youssef Ibn Tachfin and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra\u00efs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J\u00e9nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque, and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.\n Bab El Oued: Literally the River's Gate, the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond \"the gate of the river\". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with \u201cthe three clocks\u201d and for its \u201cmarket Triplet\u201d, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.\n Edge of sea: from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard Che Guevara (formerly the Boulevard of the Republic).\n Kouba (will daira of Hussein-dey): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.\nEl Harrach, a suburb of Algiers, is located about 10 kilometres (6 miles) to the east of the city.\nThe communes of Hydra, Ben Aknoun, El-Biar and Bouzareah form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the \"Heights of Algiers\". These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.\nThe  Didouche Mourad street is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the Grande Post office to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the place Audin, the Faculty of Algiers, The Crowned Heart and the park of Galland. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlgiers has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). Its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior. Algiers on average receives roughly 600 millimetres (24 in) of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean Spain, and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean France, as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate.\nSnow is very rare; in 2012, the city received 100 millimetres (4 in) of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years.\n\n\n== Government ==\nSee also: Algiers politics and administration (fr) and List of mayors of AlgiersThe city (and province) of Algiers is composed of 13 administrative districts, sub-divided into 57 communes listed below with their populations at the 1998 and 2008 Censuses:\n\n\n== Local architecture ==\n\nThere are many public buildings of interest, including the whole Kasbah quarter, Martyrs Square (Sahat ech-Chouhada \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0621), the government offices (formerly the British consulate), the \"Grand\", \"New\", and Ketchaoua Mosques, the Roman Catholic cathedral of Notre Dame d'Afrique, the Bardo Museum, the old Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale d'Alger\u2014a Turkish palace built in 1799\u20131800\u2014and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the British Library.\nThe main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into barracks, and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a minaret and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.Djamaa el Kebir (Jamaa-el-Kebir \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (minbar \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of Tlemcen, in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by Moorish arches.The New Mosque (Jamaa-el-Jedid \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is 27 metres (89 ft) high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the rue d'Isly near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in Ireland, sacked Baltimore, and enslaved its inhabitants.\n\nThe Ketchaoua mosque (Djamaa Ketchaoua \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0648\u0629), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a portico supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of Moorish plaster work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of San Geronimo. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and Byzantine styles.\nAlgiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The Bardo Museum holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial\u2014the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of 95 hectares (235 acres). An opening in the south jetty affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a mole. The lighthouse which occupies the site of Fort Penon was built in 1544.Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a rampart, parapet and ditch, with two terminal forts, Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646 to the south and Bab-el-Oued \u0627\u062f to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of Bouzareah \u0628\u0648\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 (at an elevation of 396 metres (1,299 ft) above the sea) took their place.Notre Dame d'Afrique, a church built (1858\u20131872) in a mixture of the Roman and Byzantine styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the Bouzareah hills, 3 km (2 mi)\nto the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the Virgin depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the archangel Michael, belonging to the confraternity of Neapolitan fishermen.Villa Abd-el-Tif, former residence of the dey, was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the Abd-el-Tif prize, among whom Maurice Boitel, for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nNotre Dame d'Afrique, accessible by one cable car, is one of the city's most outstanding monuments: located in the district of Z' will ghara, the basilica was built around 1858.\nMonument des Martyrs (Marquand E' chahid): an iconic concrete monument commemorating the Algerian war for independence. The monument was opened in 1982 on the 20th anniversary of Algeria's independence. It is fashioned in the shape of three standing palm leaves which shelter the \"Eternal Flame\" beneath. At the edge of each palm leaf stands a statue of a soldier, each representing a stage of Algeria's struggle.\nThe El Jedid mosque at the Place des Martyrs near the port.\nPlace of the Emir Abdelkader (formerly Bugeaud): in memory of the famous emir Abd El-Kader, resistant during French conquest of Algeria.\nGrand Post Office (1910, by Voinot and Tondoire): construction of the neo-Moorish type which is in full centre town of Algiers.\nThe Jardin d'essai (Garden of Test; El-Hamma): situated in the east of Algiers, it extends over 80 hectares (198 acres) and contains exotic plants and gardens. It was created in 1832 by A. Hardy.\nVilla Abd-el-Hair, with the top of the Garden of test, one of the old residences of the dey, where until 1962, were placed the artists prizes winner of Price Abd-el-Hair, and in particular Maurice Boitel and Andre Hamburg.\nCitadel.\nRiadh El-Feth (shopping centre and art gallery).\nKetchaoua Mosque (This mosque became the Saint-Philippe cathedral during colonization before becoming again a mosque).\nNational Library, is in the district of El HAMMA and was built in the 1990s.\nDjamaa el Kebir at the Rue de la Marine. It is the oldest mosque of Algiers and was built during the reign of the Almoravid sultan Yusuf ibn Tashfin.\nLe Bastion 23 \u2013 Palais des Rais, built in 1576 by Dey Ramdhan Pacha and located in the lower Casbah in the Bab El Oued neighborhood.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAlgiers has a population of about 3,335,418 (2012 estimate).The ethnic distribution is 53% from an Arabic-speaking background, 44% from a Berber-speaking background and 3% foreign-born.\n\n1940 \u2013 300,000 people lived in Algiers.\n1960 \u2013 900,000 people lived in Algiers.\n1963 \u2013 600,000 people lived in Algiers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlgiers is an important economic, commercial and financial center, with in particular a stock exchange with a capitalisation of 60 million euros. The city has the highest cost of living of any city in North Africa, as well as the 50th highest worldwide, as of March 2007, having gained one position compared to the previous year.Mohamed Ben Ali El Abbar, president of the Council of Administration of the Emirate Group EMAAR, presented five \"megaprojects\" to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, during a ceremony which took place Saturday, July 15, within the Palace of the People of Algiers. These projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area and restoration and leisure facilities.\nThe first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station \"Aga\" located in the downtown area. The ultramodern station intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.\nThe second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the 44 km (27 mi) sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.\n\nThe third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of \"city of wellness\". El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be \"agreeable for all those which will want to combine tourism and well-being or tourism and relaxation\". The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.\nAnother project relates to technological implantation of a campus in Sidi Abdellah, 25 km (16 mi) south-east from Algiers. This 90 hectares (222 acres) site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels. Two other residential zones, including 1.800 apartments and 40 high standard villas, will be built on the surrounding hills.\nThe fifth project is that of the tourist complex Colonel Abb\u00e8s, which will be located 25 km (16 mi) west from Algiers. This complex will include several retail zones, meeting places, and residential zones composed of apartments and villas with views of the sea.There is another project under construction, by the name of Algiers Medina. The first step of the project is nearly complete.\nA Hewlett Packard office for French-speaking countries in Africa is in Algiers.\n\n\n== Tourist installations ==\n\nSome 20 km (12 mi) to the west of Algiers are such seaside resorts as Sidi Fredj (ex-Sidi Ferruch), Palm Beach, Douaouda, Z\u00e9ralda, and the  Club of the Pines  (residence of State); there are tourist complexes, Algerian and other restaurants, souvenir shops, supervised beaches, and other amenities.

        "wiki": "Algiers ( al-JEERZ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u200e, romanized: Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir; French: Alger) is the capital and largest city of Algeria. The city's population at the 2008 Census was 2,988,145 and in 2011 was estimated to be around 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around 5,000,000. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean Sea and in the north-central portion of Algeria.Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the Mediterranean Sea. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the deys, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel, 122 metres (400 ft) above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city's name is derived via French and Catalan Alger from the Arabic name al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631), \"The Islands\". This name refers to the four former islands which lay off the city's coast before becoming part of the mainland in 1525. Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir is itself a truncated form of the city's older name Jaza\u02beir Ban\u012b Mazghanna (\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0632\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0629), \"The Islands of the Banu Mazghanna,Sons of Mazghana\", used by early medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi.\nIn antiquity, the Greeks knew the town as Ik\u00f3sion (Ancient Greek: \u1f38\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), which was Latinized as Icosium under Roman rule. The Greeks explained the name as coming from their word for \"twenty\" (\u03b5\u1f34\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9, e\u00edkosi), supposedly because it had been founded by 20 companions of Hercules when he visited the Atlas Mountains during his labors.Algiers is also known as el-Behdja (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629, \"The Joyous\") or \"Algiers the White\" (French: Alger la Blanche) for its whitewashed buildings, seen rising from the sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nA small Phoenician colony on Algiers's former islands was established and taken over by the Carthaginians sometime before the 3rd century BC. After the Punic Wars, the Romans eventually took over administration of the town, which they called Icosium. Its ruins now form part of the modern city's marine quarter, with the Rue de la Marine following a former Roman road. Roman cemeteries existed near Bab-el-Oued and Bab Azoun. The city was given Latin rights by the emperor Vespasian. The bishops of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century, but the ancient town fell into obscurity during the Muslim conquest of North Africa.\nThe present city was founded in 944 by Bologhine ibn Ziri, the founder of the Berber Zirid\u2013Sanhaja dynasty.  He had earlier (935) built his own house and a Sanhaja center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.  Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by Roger II of Sicily in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the Hammadids in 1014. The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the Almohads in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Ziyanid sultans of Tlemcen. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under amirs of its own due to Oran being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.The Pe\u00f1\u00f3n of Algiers, an islet in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by the Spaniards as early as 1302. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and Spain. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Pe\u00f1on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nIn 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the Capture of Algiers (1516). Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the Fall of Tlemcen (1517), was the founder of the pashaluk, which subsequently became the beylik, of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the Capture of Algiers (1529), and then formally invited the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlgiers from this time became the chief seat of the Barbary pirates. In October 1541 in the Algiers expedition, the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their Pasha, Hassan.\n\nFormally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. The United States fought two wars (the First and Second Barbary Wars) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.\nAmong the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes, who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period. The primary source for knowledge of Algiers of this period, since there are no contemporary local sources, is the Topograf\u00eda e historia general de Argel (1612, but written earlier), published by Diego de Haedo, but whose authorship is disputed. This work describes in detail the city, the behavior of its inhabitants, and its military defenses, with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by Spain so as to end the piracy.\nA significant number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to Islam, many fleeing the law or other problems at home. Once converted to Islam, they were safe in Algiers. Many occupied positions of authority, such as Samson Rowlie, an Englishman who became Treasurer of Algiers.The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of Andalusian, Jewish, Moorish and Kabyle communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Ottoman Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under Lord Exmouth (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715), assisted by Dutch men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nThe history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of Algeria and its relationship to France. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul\u2014whom the dey had hit with a fly-whisk when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants\u2014a French army under General de Bourmont attacked the city in the 1830 invasion of Algiers. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of French Algeria.\nMany Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population. During the 1930s, the architect Le Corbusier drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as \"nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot\". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which \"the 'civilised' live like rats in holes\" whereas \"the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being\". However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.\nDuring World War II, Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during Operation Torch.\n\nIn 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and Pieds-Noirs) during fighting between the French Army and the Algerian Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale, Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire pied-noir population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding Mitidja plain.\n\n\n=== Algerian War ===\n\nAlgiers also played a pivotal role in the Algerian War (1954\u20131962), particularly during the Battle of Algiers when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (who authorized any means \"to eliminate the insurrectionists\"), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the Fourth Republic in France, as well as the return of General de Gaulle to power.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nAlgeria achieved independence on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a real democracy baptized the \"Spring of Algier\". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.\n\n\n=== Crisis of the 1990s ===\nThe city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the Islamic Salvation Front engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a civil war between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.\nOn December 11, 2007, two car bombs exploded in Algiers. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll was at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks. However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day. As of 2008, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.Indigenous terrorist groups have been actively operating in Algeria since around 2002.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Districts of Algiers ===\n\nThe Casbah (of  Al Qasbah, \u201cthe Citadel\u201d), Ier District of Algiers: called  Al-Djaza\u00efr Al Mahroussa  (\u201cWell Kept Algiers\u201d), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K\u00e9bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by Almoravid Youssef Ibn Tachfin and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra\u00efs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J\u00e9nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque, and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.\n Bab El Oued: Literally the River's Gate, the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond \"the gate of the river\". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with \u201cthe three clocks\u201d and for its \u201cmarket Triplet\u201d, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.\n Edge of sea: from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard Che Guevara (formerly the Boulevard of the Republic).\n Kouba (will daira of Hussein-dey): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.\nEl Harrach, a suburb of Algiers, is located about 10 kilometres (6 miles) to the east of the city.\nThe communes of Hydra, Ben Aknoun, El-Biar and Bouzareah form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the \"Heights of Algiers\". These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.\nThe  Didouche Mourad street is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the Grande Post office to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the place Audin, the Faculty of Algiers, The Crowned Heart and the park of Galland. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlgiers has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). Its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior. Algiers on average receives roughly 600 millimetres (24 in) of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean Spain, and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean France, as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate.\nSnow is very rare; in 2012, the city received 100 millimetres (4 in) of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years.\n\n\n== Government ==\nSee also: Algiers politics and administration (fr) and List of mayors of AlgiersThe city (and province) of Algiers is composed of 13 administrative districts, sub-divided into 57 communes listed below with their populations at the 1998 and 2008 Censuses:\n\n\n== Local architecture ==\n\nThere are many public buildings of interest, including the whole Kasbah quarter, Martyrs Square (Sahat ech-Chouhada \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0621), the government offices (formerly the British consulate), the \"Grand\", \"New\", and Ketchaoua Mosques, the Roman Catholic cathedral of Notre Dame d'Afrique, the Bardo Museum, the old Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale d'Alger\u2014a Turkish palace built in 1799\u20131800\u2014and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the British Library.\nThe main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into barracks, and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a minaret and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.Djamaa el Kebir (Jamaa-el-Kebir \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (minbar \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of Tlemcen, in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by Moorish arches.The New Mosque (Jamaa-el-Jedid \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is 27 metres (89 ft) high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the rue d'Isly near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in Ireland, sacked Baltimore, and enslaved its inhabitants.\n\nThe Ketchaoua mosque (Djamaa Ketchaoua \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0648\u0629), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a portico supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of Moorish plaster work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of San Geronimo. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and Byzantine styles.\nAlgiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The Bardo Museum holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial\u2014the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of 95 hectares (235 acres). An opening in the south jetty affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a mole. The lighthouse which occupies the site of Fort Penon was built in 1544.Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a rampart, parapet and ditch, with two terminal forts, Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646 to the south and Bab-el-Oued \u0627\u062f to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of Bouzareah \u0628\u0648\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 (at an elevation of 396 metres (1,299 ft) above the sea) took their place.Notre Dame d'Afrique, a church built (1858\u20131872) in a mixture of the Roman and Byzantine styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the Bouzareah hills, 3 km (2 mi)\nto the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the Virgin depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the archangel Michael, belonging to the confraternity of Neapolitan fishermen.Villa Abd-el-Tif, former residence of the dey, was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the Abd-el-Tif prize, among whom Maurice Boitel, for a while of two years.

It houses the National Museum of Miniatures, Illumination and Calligraphy.It was built by the future Dey Mustapha Pacha between 1798 and 1799. The main entrance to the palace is situated at No. 12 Ahmad and Muhammad Mecheri Street, under a projecting roof terrace which is bordered by rows of Roman tiles. The main door opens onto a sqifa (entrance hall), which leads to the main courtyard of the palace. The courtyard is sheltered with groined vaults and is dispersed with decorative niches which form window-seat benches. There is also a second entrance hall which is overlooked by two marble-framed doors; this connects the main sqifa used by visitors to enter the interior courtyard. The centre of the residential quarters is surrounded by galleries and supported by arches which rest on marble columns and are distinguished by decorative tiles. The ceilings are supported by wooden beams which cover the galleries on the ground floor and the first floor of the palace.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCasbah of Algiers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

      "name": "Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a funerary monument located on the road between Cherchell and Algiers, in Tipaza Province, Algeria. The mausoleum is the tomb where the Berber King Juba II and The Queen Cleopatra Selene II, sovereigns of Numidia and Mauretania, were allegedly buried. However, their human remains have not been found at the site, perhaps due to tomb raiding.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe sepulchre is sometimes known as the Mausoleum of Juba and Cleopatra Selene. In French, it is called the Tombeau de la Chr\u00e9tienne (\"the tomb of the Christian woman\") because there is a Christian cross-like shape of the division lines on the false door. In Arabic, the mausoleum is called the Kubr-er-Rumia or Kbor er Roumia, which means \"tomb of the Christian woman\", as R\u00fbm was taken in Arabic as the Eastern Roman Empire and, in North Africa, rumi took the meaning \"Christian\".\nIt may have been a deformation of a Punic phrase for \"the royal tomb\".\n\n\n=== Royal Family of Mauretania ===\nThe mausoleum was built in 3 BC by the last King of Numidia, and later King of Mauretania, Juba II, and his wife Cleopatra Selene II, She was an Egyptian-Greek Ptolemaic princess, the daughter of the Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. Through her marriage to Juba II, she became the last Queen of Numidia and later Queen of Mauretania.\nThe mausoleum is probably the Royal Tomb that the 1st-century Roman geographer Pomponius Mela (1.31) described as the monumentum commune regiae gentis (\"the communal mausoleum of the royal family\"). If the geographer\u2019s description of the mausoleum is correct, then the building was not intended just for Juba and Cleopatra, but envisaged as a dynastic funeral monument for their royal descendants.\nThe Mauretanian sepulchre looks similar to the Mausoleum of Augustus erected by the first Roman Emperor Augustus in Ancient Rome. Augustus began constructing his mausoleum between 29 BC-27 BC, some time before Juba II left Rome to return to Numidia.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a common type of ancient mausoleums found in Numidia. It is built on a hill some 250 metres (756 feet) above sea level. The monument is entirely built from stone, while its main structure is in a circular form with a square base topped by a cone or a pyramid. The square base measures 60 to 60.9 metres square or 200 to 209 foot. The height of the monument was originally about 40 metres or 130\u2019 in height. Due to damage that the mausoleum has suffered from natural elements and vandalism, the monument now measures 30-32.4 metres in height. The base of the monument was decorated with 60 Ionic columns whose capitals were removed, possibly stolen. Inside, the centre of the mausoleum has two vaulted chambers, separated by a short passage connected by a gallery outside by stone doors which can be moved up and down by levers. The passage leading to the chambers is about 500\u2019. One chamber measures 142 feet long by 11 feet broad and is 11 feet high, while the other is smaller.\n\n\n=== Under the Ottomans and French ===\n\nIn the 16th century, the mausoleum was believed by some Spaniards to be the tomb of Florinda la Cava, the legendary Spanish woman, whose rape led to the Islamic conquest of Iberia.\nIt has been explained as a confusion of Qabr Arrumiyya (\"Christian tomb\", locally qb\u00e9r \u00e9rromiya) and q\u00e0hba romiya (\"Christian whore\").In 1555, the Pasha of Algiers, Salah Rais, gave orders to pull down the mausoleum. After large black wasps swarmed out and stung some of the workers to death, the effort was abandoned. At the end of the 18th century, Baba Mahommed tried in vain to destroy the monument with artillery. Later, when the French occupied Algeria the monument was used by the French Navy for target practice.\n\n\n=== Recognition and conservation of the Mausoleum ===\nThe human remains of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene have not been found at the site. This perhaps due to a grave robbery that occurred at an uncertain time (possibly shortly after the Mausoleum's construction). It is also possible that the structure was simply meant to serve as a memorial and not an actual place of burial.The Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a part of a unique archeological site along the road from Cherchell to Tipaza. On this archeological site, there are various monuments and infrastructure that have survived from the Phoenician (see also Carthage National Museum), Roman, Early Christianity and Byzantine periods. This group of ruins that are located along the Mediterranean Sea were recognized and inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.\nAlthough these archaeological remains, including the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania, are protected, the ruins located between Cherchell and Tipaza face constant threats from continual urban construction and expansion, open sewage drainage run offs, poor maintenance, and constant vandalism. Due to these ongoing problems, these archaeological remains face an uncertain future.\nThe local authorities have failed and had problems implementing a 1992 \u2018Permanent Safeguarding and Presentation Plan\u2019 an effective management program in preserving these ruins. In 2001, the World Heritage Site provided emergency assistance for this archaeological site.

The fort is among several Ottoman forts built during the Ottoman rule of Algeria, which were established to guard the city of Algiers. With the exception of Bordj Tamentfoust, most of the forts no longer exist or in a good condition. The fort was built on the highest point of Tamentfoust, at the western end of the Bay of Algiers. \n\n\n== History ==\nIt was commissioned in 1661 during the rule of Ismail Pasha, on the part of Agha Ramadan. It was later renovated in 1685 by Hussein Mozomorto, a dey hailed from Italy. The exact date of construction is remain contested. French historian \u00c9mile Boutin says that it was built in 1685 in response to the French military campaign led by Abraham Duquesne of bombing the city of Algiers. Another French historian Georges Mar\u00e7ais says that it was built in 1722 under the rule of the dey Muhammad Pasha.The fort had faced the French raids several times, led by Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es under the order of Louis XIV in 1688. On July 23, 1830, the official declaration of jihad against France took place in the fort, in which chiefs of several tribes in the area had gathered together, including Bani Khalil, Bani al-Khashana and Bani al-Sabt.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nIt is octagonal-shaped, and contains twelve rooms, eleven of which are distributed into three groups over seven sides surrounding the yard. One of the rooms is set up as a prayer room and contains mihrab without any decorations. Above these rooms is surface with barricades which have porthole in them. The wall is built from large stones, and the height of the fort reaches around nine meters measuring from the bottom of the moat. The fort was adjoined with another fort called \"Bordj al-Ingliz\" (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0632\u200e) which was equipped with a moat as well.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Cherchell (Arabic: \u0634\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0644 Berber: \u2d5b\u2d3b\u2d54\u2d5b\u2d3b\u2d4d) is a town on Algeria's Mediterranean coast, 89 kilometers (55 mi) west of Algiers. It is the seat of Cherchell District in Tipaza Province. Under the names Iol and Caesarea, it was formerly a Phoenician, Carthaginian, and Roman colony and the capital of the kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania.\n\n\n== Names ==\n\nThe town was originally known by a Phoenician and Punic name that included the element \u02beY (\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd09), meaning \"island\". The Punic name was hellenized as I\u1e51l (Greek: \u1f38\u1f7c\u03bb) and Latinized as Iol. In the Berber languages and Tifinagh alphabet, the city is named \u2d5b\u2d3b\u2d54\u2d5b\u2d3b\u2d4d.Cherchel and Cherchell are French transcriptions of the Arabic name Shershel (Arabic: \u0634\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0644\u200e), derived from the town's old Latin name Caesarea (Greek: \u1f21 \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, h\u0113 Kais\u00e1reia), which was given to it in 25 BC by Juba II to honor his benefactor Augustus, who had legally borne the name \"Gaius Julius Caesar\" after his posthumous adoption by Julius Caesar in 44 BC. It was later distinguished from the many other Roman towns named Caesarea by calling it Caesarea in Mauretania, Caesarea Mauretaniae (\"Mauretania's Caesarea\"), Iol Caesarea (\u1f38\u1f7c\u03bb \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, I\u1e51l Kais\u00e1reia), or Caesarea Iol. After its notional refounding as a Roman colony, it was formally named Colonia Claudia Caesariensium Iol after its imperial patron Claudius.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nPhoenicians established their first major wave of colonies on the coasts between their homeland and the Strait of Gibraltar in the 8th century BC, but Iol was probably established around 600 BC and the oldest remains so far discovered at Cherchell date from the 5th century BC. By that time, Carthage had already taken control of the Phoenicians in the western Mediterranean. Punic Iol was one of the more important trading posts in what is now Algeria. In the 3rd century BC, it was fortified and began issuing Numidia's first coins in bronze and silver, bearing Punic text, Carthaginian gods, and images of local produce, particularly fish.After the Punic Wars, Carthage's holdings in northwest Africa were mostly given to Rome's local allies. Iol was given to Micipsa, the king of Numidia, who first established it as a royal court. It became an important city for the kingdom and was the primary capital for Bocchus I and II. The town minted its own coins and received new defensive works in the 1st century BC. Its Punic culture continued, but worship of Baal Hammon was notionally substituted with worship of his Roman equivalent Saturn.Iol was annexed directly to Rome in 33 BC. Augustus established Juba II as king of Mauretania in 25 BC, giving him the city as his capital, which Juba then renamed in his honor. Juba and his wife Cleopatra (the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra of Egypt) rebuilt the city on a lavish scale, combining Roman and Hellenized Egyptian styles. The roads were relaid on a grid and amenities included a theater, an art gallery, and a lighthouse modeled after the Pharos in Alexandria. He probably began the Roman wall that ran for about 7 kilometers (4 mi) around a space of about 400 hectares (988 acres); about 150 of that total was used for the settlement in antiquity. The royal couple were buried in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. The seaport capital and its kingdom flourished during this period, with most of the population being of Greek and Phoenician origin with a minority of Berbers.\nTheir son Ptolemy was assassinated by Caligula during a trip to Rome in AD 40. Rome proclaimed the annexation of Mauretania, which was resisted by Ptolemy's former slave Aedemon and by Berber leaders such as Sabalus. Caligula himself was murdered before Rome's response could be made, but his successor Claudius sent legions under Gn. Hosidius Geta and G. Suetonius Paulinus to complete the conquest. By 44, most resistance had been ended and the former kingdom was divided into two Roman provinces, one governed from Tingis (present-day Tangiers) and another governed from Caesarea. Mauretania Caesariensis extended along what is now the Algerian coast and included most of the hinterland as far as the Atlas Mountains.\nRoman colonies of veteran soldiers were established in the new provinces to maintain order. Caesarea itself was made a colony, with its residents gaining Roman citizenship. It prospered as a provincial capital during the 1st and 2nd centuries, reaching a population of over 20,000 and possibly as many as 30,000. It was defended by auxiliary units and was the harbor of Rome's Mauretanian Fleet, which was established as a permanent force after Berber raids in the early 170s. The city featured a hippodrome, amphitheater, numerous temples, and civic buildings like a basilica. It was surrounded by suburban villas whose agricultural mosaics are now celebrated. It had its own school of philosophy, academy, and library. It received a new forum and further patronage from the African emperor Septimius Severus and his dynasty, possibly reaching as many as 100,000 inhabitants. Its native son Macrinus and his son Diadumenian became the first Berber and lower-class emperors, reigning in 217 and 218. (Their predecessor's wastefulness and wars required unpopular financial adjustments that led to their overthrow in favor of Elagabalus.) Juba's theater was converted into an amphitheater sometime after the year 300.The city was sacked by a Berber revolt in 371 and 372. It largely recovered, but was ravaged again by the Vandals after they were invited into Roman North Africa by Count Boniface in 429. Parts of the town received new fortifications. After the Vandal Kingdom conquered Carthage in 439, they also acquired a large part of Rome's Mediterranean fleet which they used to carry out raids all over the sea. Caesarea's port was sometimes used as a base for these raiders, and the city prospered from their plunder. Its schools produced the famous grammarian Priscian, who emigrated to the Byzantine east.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 533, the Vandal Kingdom was conquered by Byzantine forces under Justinian's general Belisarius. Caesarea was among the areas to return to imperial rule. It was the seat of Mauretania's duke (Latin: dux), but it went into decline and its city center was given over to ramshackle housing for the poor. The first duke was named John; that he was given an infantry unit rather than cavalry implies that he was meant to hold the port without much concern about controlling its surrounding hinterland.The town remained under Byzantine control until its Muslim conquest in the late 7th century. Successive waves of Umayyad attacks into Byzantine North African territory over 15 years wore down the smaller and less motivated imperial forces, until finally Umayyad troops laid siege to the city of Caesarea and, although the defenders were resupplied by Byzantine fleets, finally overwhelmed it. Much of the Byzantine nobility and officials fled to other parts of the Empire, while most of the remaining Roman and semi-Roman Berber population accepted Islamic rule which granted them protected status.\nSome remained Christians. For two generations what remained of the Roman population and Romanized Berbers launched several revolts often in conjunction with reinforcements from the Empire. As a result, by the ninth century down much of the city's defences were damaged beyond repair, and resulting in its political loss of importance, leaving the former city little more than a small village.\nFor the following few centuries, the city remained a power center of Arabs and Berbers with a small but significant population of Christians who were fully assimilated by the beginning of the Early Modern period. Similarly, by the 10th century the city's name had transformed in the local dialect from a Latin to a Berber and ultimately into the Arabised form Sharshal (in French orthography, Cherchell).\nDuring the later Middle Ages, several attempts at reconquest were made by Europeans, who managed to hold the city off and on for a few generations. Notable of these in providing material for historical review, especially of what remained of its Roman and Byzantine infrastructure and population was the Norman Kingdom of Africa.\n\n\n=== Modernity ===\nEventually, Ottoman Turks managed to successfully reconquer the city from Spanish occupation in the 16th century, using the city primarily as a fortified port.  In 1520, Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the town and annexed the Algerian Pashalic. His elder brother Oru\u00e7 Reis built a fort over the town. Under Turkish occupation, the city's importance as a port and fort led to it being inhabited by Moslems of many nationalities, some engaging in privateering and piracy on the Mediterranean.\nIn reply, European navies and especially the French Navy and the Knights Hospitaller (self-proclaimed descendants of the Crusaders) laid siege to the city and occasionally captured it for limited periods of time. For a century in the 1600s and for a brief period in the 1700s the city either was under Spanish or Hospitallar control. During this period a number of palaces were built, but the overwhelming edifice of Hayreddin Barbarossa's citadel, was considered too militarily valuable to destroy and uncover the previous ancient buildings of old Caesarea.\nAfter the end of the Napoleonic Wars and Revolutions of the early 19th century, the French under both British, American, and other European powers were encouraged to attack and destroy the Barbary Pirates. From 1836 to 1840 various allied navies, but mostly French hunted down the Barbary pirates and conquered the Barbary ports while threatening the Ottoman Empire with war if it intervened.  In 1840, the French after a significant siege captured and occupied the town. The French lynched the Barbary Pirates including the local pasha for Crimes against the laws of nations.{fact}\n\nIn turn, many ancient statues and buildings were either restored and left in Cherchell, or taken to museums in Algiers, Algeria or Paris, France for further study.  However, not all building projects were successful in uncovering and restoring the ancient town. The Roman amphitheatre was considered mostly unsalvageable and unnecessary to rebuilt. Its dress stones were used to the build a new French fort and barracks. Materials from the Hippodrome were used to build a new church. The steps of the Hippodrome were partly destroyed by Cardinal Charles Lavigerie in a search for the tomb of Saint Marciana.\nFrench occupation also brought new European settlement, to join the city's long-established communities of semi-Arabized Christians of local origin and old European merchant families, in addition to Berbers and Arab Muslims. Under French rule, European and Christians became a majority of the population again until World War II.\nIn the immediate years before World War II, losses to the French national population from World War I, and a declining birthrate in general among Europeans kept further colonial settlement to a trickle. Arab and Berber populations started seeing an increase in growth. French-Algerian colonial officials and landowners encouraged larger numbers of surrounding Berber tribesmen to move into the surrounding region to work the farms and groves cheaply. In turn, more and more Berbers and Arabs moved into the city seeking employment. By 1930 the combined Berbo-Arab Algerian population represented nearly 40% of the city's population.\nThe changing demographics within the city were disguised by the large numbers of French military personnel based there and the numbers of European tourists visiting what had become known as the Algerian Riviera. Additionally, during World War II, Cherchell, with its libraries, cafes, restaurants, and hotels served as a base for the United States Army and Allied War effort, hosting a summit conference between the US and UK in October 1942.\nThe end of the war with its departure of Allied forces and a reduction of French naval personnel due to rebasing saw an actual decline in Europeans living in the city. Additionally, the general austerity of the post-war years dried up the tourism industry and caused financial stagnation and losses to the local Franco-Algerian community. In 1952, a census recorded that the Frenco-Algerian population had declined to 50% of the population.\nFor the remaining 1950's Cherchell was only slightly caught up by the Algerian War of Independence. With its large proportion of Europeans, French control and influence was strong enough to discourage all but the most daring attacks by anti-French insurgents.  By 1966, after independence from the French, Cherchell had lost nearly half of its population and all of its Franco-Algerian population.\n\n\n=== Independent Algeria ===\nCherchell has continued to grow post-independence, recovering to peak colonial-era population by the 1980s. Cherchell currently has industries in marble, plaster quarries and iron mines. The town trades in oils, tobacco and earthenware. Additionally, the ancient cistern first developed by Juba and Cleopatra Selene II was restored and expanded under recent French rule and still supplies water to the town.\nAlthough the Algerian Riviera ended with the war, Cherchell is still a popular tourist places in Algeria. Cherchell has various splendid temples and monuments from the Punic, Numidian and Roman periods, and the works of art found there, including statues of Neptune and Venus, are now in the Museum of Antiquities in Algiers. The former Roman port is no longer in commercial use and has been partly filled by alluvial deposits and has been affected by earthquakes. The former local mosque of the Hundred Columns contains 89 columns of diorite. This remarkable building now serves as a hospital. The local museum displays some of the finest ancient Greek and Roman antiquities found in Africa. Cherchell is the birthplace of writer and movie director Assia Djebar.\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\n\n== Remains ==\nEarthquakes, wars and plunder have ravaged many of the ancient remains.\n\nThe town (of Caesarea) remains insufficiently known....The town walls, studied in 1946, pose more problems; and the monuments are more often simply marked than completely known. The amphitheater, which has been excavated, remains unpublished; the very large hippodrome, which appears clearly on aerial photographs, is known only through old borings. The temples, which have been found on a spur of the mountain to the East of the central esplanade, on the edge of the route from T\u00e9n\u00e8s to the West of the modern town, are too much destroyed to warrant publication even of plans. The baths along the edge of the sea, rather majestic, are also badly preserved. One would scarcely recognize several houses recently excavated. Grouped around peristyles with vast trichinia, they are readily adapted to the terrain and are constructed on terraces on the lower slopes or on the edge of cliffs with views over the sea. They often are preserved for us only in a late form\u20144th c. A.D.\u2014and traces of the era of Juba are found only in the lower strata. The theater is an exception; still well preserved in 1840, it has since served as a quarry. It was set against the slope of the mountain. At the back of the scaena towards the N was a portico, covered over today by a street, where Gsell saw the S side of the forum. Of the rich scaenae frons there remain only traces and several statues, of which two are colossal muses. The orchestra had hater undergone great modification which had resulted in the disappearance of the platform of the stage: an oval arena had been built, intended for hunting spectacles, and a wall was raised between the first row of seats and the cavea to protect spectators from the wild beasts. The sumptuously decorated monument is consequently very much mutilated, but is of interest specifically because of its complex history.The amphitheater, in the E part of the town, was erected in flat open country. It was not oval but rectangular, with the short sides rounded. The tiers of seats, for the most part missing, were carried on ramping vaults, and the arena floor was cut by two perpendicular passages intended for beasts. It is in this arena that St. Marciana was martyred.\nSome remains can be seen in the local Archeological Museum of Chercell-Caesarea.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nChristianity arrived in Caesarea early enough to produce martyrs during the Diocletianic Persecution. For vandalizing an idol of Diana, St Marciana was supposedly tortured and killed in Caesarea's arena, gored by a bull and mauled by a leopard for the amusement of the crowd. St Theodota and her sons were also supposedly martyred in the city.Caesarea was a bishopric from about 314 to 484, although not all of its bishops are known. Fortunatus took part in the 314 Council of Arles, which condemned Donatism. Clemens was mentioned in one of Symmachus's letters and would have served in the 370s. During the 411 synod at Carthage, Caesarea was represented by the Donatist Emeritus and the orthodox Deuterius. St Augustine accosted Emeritus at Caesarea in the autumn of 418 and secured his exile. Apocorius was an orthodox bishop whom Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484 and then exiled. An early 8th-century Notitia Episcopatuum still included this see.Caesarea was revived by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see in the 19th century. It was distinguished as \"Caesarea in Mauretania\" in 1933. Its bishops have included:\n\nTitular Bishop Biagio Pisani (1897.04.23 \u2013 1901.06.07)\nTitular Bishop Pietro Maffi (1902.06.09 \u2013 1903.06.22)\nTitular Bishop Thomas Francis Brennan (1905.10.07 \u2013 1916.03.20)\nTitular Archbishop Pierre-C\u00e9lestin C\u00e9zerac (1918.01.02 \u2013 1918.03.18)\nTitular Archbishop Cardinal Wilhelmus Marinus van Rossum, CSSR (1918.04.25 \u2013 1918.05.20)\nTitular Archbishop Benedetto Aloisi Masella (1919.12.15 \u2013 1946.02.18)\nTitular Bishop Luigi Cammarata (1946.12.04 \u2013 1950.02.25)\nTitular Bishop Francesco Pennisi (1950.07.11 \u2013 1955.10.01)\nTitular Bishop Andr\u00e9-Jacques Fougerat (1956.07.16 \u2013 1957.01.05)\nTitular Bishop Carmelo Canzonieri (1957.03.11 \u2013 1963.07.30)\nTitular Bishop Archbishop Enea Selis (1964.01.18 \u2013 1971.09.02)\nTitular Bishop Giuseppe Moizo (1972.01.22 \u2013 1976.07.01)\nTitular Archbishop Sergio Sebastiani (1976.09.27 \u2013 2001.02.21)\nTitular Bishop Gerard Johannes Nicolaas de Korte (2001.04.11 \u2013 2008.06.18)\nTitular Bishop Stanislaus Tobias Magombo (2009.04.29 \u2013 2010.07.06)\nTitular Archbishop Walter Brandm\u00fcller (2010.11.04 \u2013 2010.11.20)\nTitular Archbishop Marek Solczy\u0144ski (2011.11.26 \u2013 present)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lighthouses in Algeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nS.

        "wiki": "Algiers ( al-JEERZ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u200e, romanized: Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir; French: Alger) is the capital and largest city of Algeria. The city's population at the 2008 Census was 2,988,145 and in 2011 was estimated to be around 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around 5,000,000. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean Sea and in the north-central portion of Algeria.Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the Mediterranean Sea. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the deys, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel, 122 metres (400 ft) above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city's name is derived via French and Catalan Alger from the Arabic name al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631), \"The Islands\". This name refers to the four former islands which lay off the city's coast before becoming part of the mainland in 1525. Al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir is itself a truncated form of the city's older name Jaza\u02beir Ban\u012b Mazghanna (\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0632\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0629), \"The Islands of the Banu Mazghanna,Sons of Mazghana\", used by early medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi.\nIn antiquity, the Greeks knew the town as Ik\u00f3sion (Ancient Greek: \u1f38\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), which was Latinized as Icosium under Roman rule. The Greeks explained the name as coming from their word for \"twenty\" (\u03b5\u1f34\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9, e\u00edkosi), supposedly because it had been founded by 20 companions of Hercules when he visited the Atlas Mountains during his labors.Algiers is also known as el-Behdja (\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629, \"The Joyous\") or \"Algiers the White\" (French: Alger la Blanche) for its whitewashed buildings, seen rising from the sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nA small Phoenician colony on Algiers's former islands was established and taken over by the Carthaginians sometime before the 3rd century BC. After the Punic Wars, the Romans eventually took over administration of the town, which they called Icosium. Its ruins now form part of the modern city's marine quarter, with the Rue de la Marine following a former Roman road. Roman cemeteries existed near Bab-el-Oued and Bab Azoun. The city was given Latin rights by the emperor Vespasian. The bishops of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century, but the ancient town fell into obscurity during the Muslim conquest of North Africa.\nThe present city was founded in 944 by Bologhine ibn Ziri, the founder of the Berber Zirid\u2013Sanhaja dynasty.  He had earlier (935) built his own house and a Sanhaja center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.  Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by Roger II of Sicily in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the Hammadids in 1014. The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the Almohads in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Ziyanid sultans of Tlemcen. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under amirs of its own due to Oran being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.The Pe\u00f1\u00f3n of Algiers, an islet in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by the Spaniards as early as 1302. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and Spain. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Pe\u00f1on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nIn 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the Capture of Algiers (1516). Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the Fall of Tlemcen (1517), was the founder of the pashaluk, which subsequently became the beylik, of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the Capture of Algiers (1529), and then formally invited the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlgiers from this time became the chief seat of the Barbary pirates. In October 1541 in the Algiers expedition, the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their Pasha, Hassan.\n\nFormally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. The United States fought two wars (the First and Second Barbary Wars) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.\nAmong the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist Miguel de Cervantes, who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period. The primary source for knowledge of Algiers of this period, since there are no contemporary local sources, is the Topograf\u00eda e historia general de Argel (1612, but written earlier), published by Diego de Haedo, but whose authorship is disputed. This work describes in detail the city, the behavior of its inhabitants, and its military defenses, with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by Spain so as to end the piracy.\nA significant number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to Islam, many fleeing the law or other problems at home. Once converted to Islam, they were safe in Algiers. Many occupied positions of authority, such as Samson Rowlie, an Englishman who became Treasurer of Algiers.The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of Andalusian, Jewish, Moorish and Kabyle communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Ottoman Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under Lord Exmouth (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715), assisted by Dutch men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.\n\n\n=== French rule ===\n\nThe history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of Algeria and its relationship to France. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul\u2014whom the dey had hit with a fly-whisk when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants\u2014a French army under General de Bourmont attacked the city in the 1830 invasion of Algiers. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of French Algeria.\nMany Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population. During the 1930s, the architect Le Corbusier drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as \"nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot\". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which \"the 'civilised' live like rats in holes\" whereas \"the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being\". However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.\nDuring World War II, Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during Operation Torch.\n\nIn 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and Pieds-Noirs) during fighting between the French Army and the Algerian Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale, Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire pied-noir population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding Mitidja plain.\n\n\n=== Algerian War ===\n\nAlgiers also played a pivotal role in the Algerian War (1954\u20131962), particularly during the Battle of Algiers when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (who authorized any means \"to eliminate the insurrectionists\"), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the Fourth Republic in France, as well as the return of General de Gaulle to power.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nAlgeria achieved independence on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a real democracy baptized the \"Spring of Algier\". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.\n\n\n=== Crisis of the 1990s ===\nThe city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the Islamic Salvation Front engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a civil war between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.\nOn December 11, 2007, two car bombs exploded in Algiers. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll was at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks. However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day. As of 2008, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.Indigenous terrorist groups have been actively operating in Algeria since around 2002.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Districts of Algiers ===\n\nThe Casbah (of  Al Qasbah, \u201cthe Citadel\u201d), Ier District of Algiers: called  Al-Djaza\u00efr Al Mahroussa  (\u201cWell Kept Algiers\u201d), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K\u00e9bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by Almoravid Youssef Ibn Tachfin and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra\u00efs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J\u00e9nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque, and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.\n Bab El Oued: Literally the River's Gate, the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond \"the gate of the river\". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with \u201cthe three clocks\u201d and for its \u201cmarket Triplet\u201d, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.\n Edge of sea: from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard Che Guevara (formerly the Boulevard of the Republic).\n Kouba (will daira of Hussein-dey): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.\nEl Harrach, a suburb of Algiers, is located about 10 kilometres (6 miles) to the east of the city.\nThe communes of Hydra, Ben Aknoun, El-Biar and Bouzareah form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the \"Heights of Algiers\". These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.\nThe  Didouche Mourad street is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the Grande Post office to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the place Audin, the Faculty of Algiers, The Crowned Heart and the park of Galland. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlgiers has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). Its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior. Algiers on average receives roughly 600 millimetres (24 in) of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean Spain, and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean France, as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate.\nSnow is very rare; in 2012, the city received 100 millimetres (4 in) of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years.\n\n\n== Government ==\nSee also: Algiers politics and administration (fr) and List of mayors of AlgiersThe city (and province) of Algiers is composed of 13 administrative districts, sub-divided into 57 communes listed below with their populations at the 1998 and 2008 Censuses:\n\n\n== Local architecture ==\n\nThere are many public buildings of interest, including the whole Kasbah quarter, Martyrs Square (Sahat ech-Chouhada \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0621), the government offices (formerly the British consulate), the \"Grand\", \"New\", and Ketchaoua Mosques, the Roman Catholic cathedral of Notre Dame d'Afrique, the Bardo Museum, the old Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale d'Alger\u2014a Turkish palace built in 1799\u20131800\u2014and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the British Library.\nThe main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into barracks, and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a minaret and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.Djamaa el Kebir (Jamaa-el-Kebir \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (minbar \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of Tlemcen, in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by Moorish arches.The New Mosque (Jamaa-el-Jedid \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is 27 metres (89 ft) high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the rue d'Isly near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in Ireland, sacked Baltimore, and enslaved its inhabitants.\n\nThe Ketchaoua mosque (Djamaa Ketchaoua \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0648\u0629), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a portico supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of Moorish plaster work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of San Geronimo. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and Byzantine styles.\nAlgiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The Bardo Museum holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial\u2014the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of 95 hectares (235 acres). An opening in the south jetty affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a mole. The lighthouse which occupies the site of Fort Penon was built in 1544.Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a rampart, parapet and ditch, with two terminal forts, Bab Azoun \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0648\u0646 to the south and Bab-el-Oued \u0627\u062f to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of Bouzareah \u0628\u0648\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 (at an elevation of 396 metres (1,299 ft) above the sea) took their place.Notre Dame d'Afrique, a church built (1858\u20131872) in a mixture of the Roman and Byzantine styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the Bouzareah hills, 3 km (2 mi)\nto the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the Virgin depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the archangel Michael, belonging to the confraternity of Neapolitan fishermen.Villa Abd-el-Tif, former residence of the dey, was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the Abd-el-Tif prize, among whom Maurice Boitel, for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nNotre Dame d'Afrique, accessible by one cable car, is one of the city's most outstanding monuments: located in the district of Z' will ghara, the basilica was built around 1858.\nMonument des Martyrs (Marquand E' chahid): an iconic concrete monument commemorating the Algerian war for independence. The monument was opened in 1982 on the 20th anniversary of Algeria's independence. It is fashioned in the shape of three standing palm leaves which shelter the \"Eternal Flame\" beneath. At the edge of each palm leaf stands a statue of a soldier, each representing a stage of Algeria's struggle.\nThe El Jedid mosque at the Place des Martyrs near the port.\nPlace of the Emir Abdelkader (formerly Bugeaud): in memory of the famous emir Abd El-Kader, resistant during French conquest of Algeria.\nGrand Post Office (1910, by Voinot and Tondoire): construction of the neo-Moorish type which is in full centre town of Algiers.\nThe Jardin d'essai (Garden of Test; El-Hamma): situated in the east of Algiers, it extends over 80 hectares (198 acres) and contains exotic plants and gardens.

The city has the highest cost of living of any city in North Africa, as well as the 50th highest worldwide, as of March 2007, having gained one position compared to the previous year.Mohamed Ben Ali El Abbar, president of the Council of Administration of the Emirate Group EMAAR, presented five \"megaprojects\" to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, during a ceremony which took place Saturday, July 15, within the Palace of the People of Algiers. These projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area and restoration and leisure facilities.\nThe first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station \"Aga\" located in the downtown area. The ultramodern station intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.\nThe second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the 44 km (27 mi) sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.\n\nThe third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of \"city of wellness\". El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be \"agreeable for all those which will want to combine tourism and well-being or tourism and relaxation\". The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.\nAnother project relates to technological implantation of a campus in Sidi Abdellah, 25 km (16 mi) south-east from Algiers. This 90 hectares (222 acres) site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels. Two other residential zones, including 1.800 apartments and 40 high standard villas, will be built on the surrounding hills.\nThe fifth project is that of the tourist complex Colonel Abb\u00e8s, which will be located 25 km (16 mi) west from Algiers.

        "wiki": "The New Town Hall (German: Neues Rathaus) or New City Hall in Hanover, Germany, is a city hall and was opened on July 20, 1913, after having been under construction for 12 years. It is a magnificent, castle-like building of the era of Wilhelm II in eclectic style at the southern edge of the inner city (outside of the historic city centre of Hanover). The building is embedded in the 10 hectare Maschpark. The Old Town Hall is no longer used as the main seat of administration, but houses businesses and the registry office.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn its day, the building cost 10 million Marks. It was erected on 6026 beech piles by the architects, Hermann Eggert and Gustav Halmhuber. \"Ten million Marks, Your Majesty \u2013 and all paid for in cash\", announced the City Director, Heinrich Tramm, when the New Town Hall was opened by Emperor Wilhelm II. The square in front of the City Hall was named Trammplatz in honour of Tramm. The New Town Hall replaced the Wangenheimpalais as the city hall from then on.\nDuring World War II, the building was heavily damaged during American bomb raids on the inner city of Hanover. The German state of Niedersachsen was proclaimed in 1946 in the 38 m high hall of the New Town Hall.\nThe dome of the New Town Hall, with its observation platform, is 97.73 m high. The dome's lift is unique in Europe, with its arched course (parabolic, following the shape of the dome). It is often incorrectly described as a sloping lift up the dome and compared with the lifts in the Eiffel Tower, which actually only travel diagonally, without changing their angle of inclination. The lift climbs the 50 m shaft at an angle of up to 17\u00b0 to the gallery of the dome, where the Harz mountain range can be seen when visibility is good. In the process, the lift moves over 10 m. During the trip, the two weight-bearing cables wind up on three double rolls in the wall of the shaft.\n\nThe lift was erected in 1913. The lift cage travelled in steam-bent oaken tracks. Because of the weather, the original lift was not usable in the colder half of the year. There is a spiral staircase, which leads from the lift exit to the observation level. In 2005, over 90,000 people visited the tower of the New Town Hall. A new lift was installed in winter of 2007\u201308. The last trip of the old lift took place with Lord Mayor Stephan Weil on November 4, 2007. On that weekend, 1200 guests took the last opportunity to ride in the old lift.\nThere are four city models of Hanover in the ground floor of the New Town Hall. They vividly portray the development of the city.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nWolfgang Steinweg: Das Rathaus in Hannover. Von der Kaiserzeit bis in die Gegenwart.

          "Good for a lazy day out with kids, lot to place to sit, walk, relax, it might be little crowded in summer but still u will enjoy. It's just in walkable distance from ubahn .",
          "Despite its vintage look, Hanover's New Town Hall is a young building. By historical standards, of course... The building is built on 6000 beech piles designed by Hermann Eggert. It was discovered by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1913, a year before world war I, which ended empires in",
          "Nice place to visit. The building is impressive and I was more impressed inside when I seen what damages had the city after the war",

          "Great history place. A great view from from top. Narrow elevator rocks. Beautiful artificial lake beside.",
          "Amazing views from the top level. A must do In Hanover. The cost is 3.50 Euro to go up. The life does a weird tilt, which is just part of the fun experience.",
          "Nice place to visit but under construction \ud83d\udea7 so you can walk around it and to have magnificent pictures",
          "A great place to visit and enjoy the architecture of the city! The views from the tower are astonishing! Hannover is a beautiful city indeed!",
          "A place not to be missed while in Hannover; beautiful architecture dated back to 1930. Special to mention is the unique tilting lift which takes you to the observatory level where you get a splendid view of the city and the lake behind.",
          "While we think this new town hall looks typical German architecture in Wilhelmine period, it is the way it was built that perplexes us. Built on 6,026 beech piles and crowned with dome tower the build will give you a good memory after your visit. A view from top is great",
          "Visited the New Town Hall in the blistering heat. Really cool place to visit, we had a 30 minute wait for the lift to go to the top, but it was well worth it. Stunning views of the City from the top.",
          "Stunning building and surroundings. I highly recommend accessing the central tower/roof which only cost \u20ac3.50. The 'tilting' lift with multiple viewing panels was an interesting (and slightly alarming - if like me you are no keen on lifts) and there are several viewing levels.",
          "It was a Historic and beatifull Place with a huge garden. The lake in ga5den is also awesome. I Reccomend",
          "Free entry. Model of the city during different stage of history. Nice spot to rest your feet on the steps of the hall and take in its grandness.",
          "My biggest regret is that I didn't have the courage to take a ride in the red-door \"lift with a difference\" - this will necessitate another visit to Hannover I suspect. After you've finished doing the history inside explore the beautiful gardens and lake outside",
          "One of the best free sights in Hannover are the four small models in the main hall of the new townhall that show how Hannover looked at different times in the past.",
          "Very scary elevator \ud83d\ude31 but amazing views and shocking to see the destruction of the city during wo\u0131\u0131",
          "A massive old and interesting building. Easy to access and very impressive to look at. Well worth a visit with a lovely coffee shop.",
          "We visited on a lovely sunny day and went to the top of the dome - the lift goes up a track which is slightly curved and you can see through the floor which is pretty cool. I'd recommend this, the views are great and it's a good way to orientate yourself.",
          "Certainly worth visiting but for me the view did not compensate the time waiting in the queue to go up and down. Skip if your time is limited.",
          "The view is great. However, it took 45 minutes to get in the lift to the tower. Only five persons are allowed to be in the lift at the same time.",
          "Its not a bad place definitely worth visiting if you are in town - nice architecture - some good scale models of the city",
          "We had a wonder around the town hall to kill some time while we were waiting for a friend. We wanted to go up in the lift for a view of the city but there was a 90 minute wait.. it was very busy with several coaches outside. The town hall is a lovely building - but not really a",
          "Worth queuing to take a trip up in the lift to see the amazing views from the top. Beautiful building, perfectly restored.",
          "History, elegance and amazing surroundings! We have been there several times with our friends and family. Definitely worth a visit!",

          "this town hall is one of the most visited spots of Hanover and not without a reason. It is visible from a distance and the red trail runs by it and also the hop-on hop-off buses stop here. The building is the new old town hall which looks like a castle with a high dome on top",
          "Well worth a visit. Of great historical interest & views from the tower. The rear of the building backs onto a lake.",
          "It's free, it's a beautiful building and it's easy to get to from the centre of the city, so why not visit? We spent an hour or so here - the stairs and inside of the main dome are wonderful and it was interesting to see with the help of the 4 historical models how the city has",
          "We were told to visit this site. the new town hall . Close to a beautiful small lake. Interesting pre and post war history",
          "This was my highlight of my short trip to Hannover. The view from the dome was well worth the queue in the cold outside (although the lift made me feel a little wobbly at times!) I visited in October, and the views over Hannover with all of the autumnal colours was simply",
          "I didn't get a chance to go inside the city hall, but I enjoyed the view of the building from the park.",
          "This place offers a lot of information about II World War and there is a maquette of the city which shows us how big and organised this city was during that horrible period.",
          "The place look so nice with a small lake around the area. Outside, the architectural design looks so nice, while inside, its have four miniature area maps showing the development of the city before, during, and after the war, and finally, the new City of Hanover.",
          "We had a lovely trip here. Inexpensive tickets to the the top to see stunning views over Hannover. Approx 7 steps to the quirky lift then you have to go up a spiral staircase to the first level. You can then choose to walk more steps to go higher. No disabled access to the top.",
          "Definitely I will return to Rathaus as much as I can when I would be in Hannover. The lift is unique and see Hannover from above is great, the mosaics as well. From outside the building is a Masterpiece, the s\u00edmbolo of Hannover, but city models - 1689, 1939, 1945 and actual) are",
          "Fine decoration and part of history. But instead of taking pictures of Hannover City Hall (Rathaus) try walking routes around Rathaus. You get different point of view and there you find lot of benches to rest.",
          "The rathouse is a must see, there you can see the history of Hannover made in four models and it is for free. You can go up the doom and see the panoramic view of the see, should not be missed. The curved left that gets you up there is very interesting",
          "Have to visit this beautiful rathaus, in the day and night. nice area around to walk and spend some time looking the lights.",
          "We chose a set meal which was excellent the staff very attentive, where we sat we had a good view of the lake we did start outside but the wasps were a pest so they took inside which was better.",
          "The park around where filled with youngsters doing the first kissing and holding hands. The walk took 15 minuets in slow steps and the late sun gave a wonderful light on the building.",
          "Don't forget to make a tour all around the city hall, especially in the evening. Enjoy some good times in the gardens with a beautifull view on the impressive building, reflected in the water.",
          "This is an historic building with a carved marble staircase. Representations of Hannover since its founding including what it looked like after bombing from WWll. Took slanting elevator to very top and the 360 view was awe inspiring.",
          "We visited the town hall around noon. We didn\u2019t get the guided tour, but had a look at the models of the city in the ground floor, and we took the elevators up to the highest tower. Great view! I highly recommend a trip here if you are a tourist in Hannover. \u2764\ufe0f",
          "This place was a wonderful surprise for us. We paid only a few euros top go to the top. A regular lift took us up three storeys. We then entered a small elevator which took us the rest of the was in a shaft shaped to follow the curve of the dome. It had a glass ceiling and",
          "Staying close to the Rathaus we went in. They have an observation platform. The views are outstanding of the whole of Hannover. In the building there are models of Hannover pre war and after. There is also a model of Hannover today. Note there are 2 lifts to the top. The first",
          "This is a very historic building and we rode the crazy elevator to the top of the dome, from which there is an outstanding view of the city.",
          "The Rathaus is a great building with history. The building itself is magnificent but the models of Hannover before WW2, and after WW2 really show the destruction that occurred. Then there is the present day model which shows how the city has been rebuilt.",
          "We went to take a quick look, and stayed for hours, I love the library there. You can't touch the books but just to see them all is impressive.",
          "This restaurant looking out over beautiful gardens is a great place to relax with a drink or meal. Just don't get lost inside the incredible Rathaus itself if you're looking for the loo. Mind you, it's such an amazing building, it might be worth it!",
          "This place is in city center of Hanover. It show cases some history about it and very interested to understand some German architecture.",

          "The Rathaus in Hannover was an amazing place to visit. Full of history and wonderful models of the City through the years. How it has grown and how it was destroyed in the war. The lift to the top was an amazing experience. It had a glass panel in the roof and the floor so you",

          "The new city hall is a beautifully restored building. The lobby displays 4 models of Hannover from its early days, just before the 2nd world, after the war with its devastating bombings and one of the modern time. You have to buy a ticket for the visit of the dome which you do",

          "Well, Hannover is not a city with plenty of tourist attractions, but there are some hidden jewels. One of them and definitely a must see is the \u201enew\u201c town hall (which is more than 100 years old anyway). First of all it\u2019s a stunning building, whe you see it, you predict it is",
          "Ok. Definitely worth visiting if you are in Hannover. Beautiful architecture. Not much else to say. Worth a walk there though.",
          "Worth a visit for sure. I went on a Sunday morning about 10 am and it was perfect. The place was nearly empty so I could take as many photos as I wanted without interruption..score! The pond behind the building was frozen and it was bitterly cold but I still braved the",
          "Absolutely stunning city hall building. Spare some time to enter inside and wonder around multiple floors of this wonderful building which is free of charge. City models at the ground floor give a nice idea how Hanover has expanded since the middle ages and how much it has been",
          "Ok to be there, but not very much to see. Some nice sculpures and architecture. But the terasse view was closed for winter.",

          "Just a few minutes walk from the centre of Hannover is the stunning Rathaus. I could go on and on about the beautiful architecture. The picturesque lake. The stunning interior. But, I won\u2019t! Pay a few euros and take the elevator to the dome. The lift twists as it ascends the",
          "Seemigly, this is the second on the list of place to visit in Hanover... Not in my esteem. The building is nice to look at from the front, and in the lobby, but the view from the side with the lake, is all covered in workmens sheets, and the lift was closed or winter. The 4",
          "Also referred to as the New Town Hall Or Neues Rathaus (I like that a Government Building is called a Rat House:-). It\u2019s an amazing building both inside and out and is free to visit but you must buy a ticket to ride the lift. Buy the ticket when you first enter otherwise",
          "My first sight to visit in Hannover, and it was absolutely worthy to visit, specially it was a sunny day which is rare there! First we took the weird elevator to the top of the tower and we checked all of Hannover up there, u can see the green areas ... the view is amazing up",
          "First be clear this is the Neues Rathaus (not to be confused with the Altes Rathaus) approached across a very wide and busy road. But once in see the wonderful space with magnificent staircases and space. Difficult to realise that it is the functioning town hall. Then go out",
          "During my business trip we stopped in Hannover. The first building which is in my opinion represent this city is Rathaus-Hannover City Hall. Very nice old style architecture. It is open to public it is a \"jewel\" of Hannover\" crown\". It is place which \"must to see\"",
          "An early start will avoid queuing for the small elevator that climbs the steeple. The views are stunning. At ground level there are amazing dioramas explaining the towns development over the centuries. The building is a popular venue for wedding photographers on Saturdays. Out",
          "If you're in Hannover for the fist time and have not that many hours to walk, just go here. You'll catch a feeling of the city, take a walk inside the building (yes, it's just open for everyone: just come inside and walk around) + you'll see 4 miniatures of the citi in different",

          "This building is a must-have when in Hannover. Stunning to look at. Inside they have a brilliant display showing Hannover over the years - the bombing was terrible and seeing it laid out like they have it really put it all into perspective. 40 minutes was too long to just stand",
          "What a lovely surprise! We enjoyed the Rathaus much more than we expected. The architecture of the building was beautiful. The models of the city pre and post WW2 fascinating and chilling and the trip up the sloping elevator to the top great fun! The views from the top really",

          "Definitely worth popping in. It is beautiful and has a model of the city c 1939. It would have been even more beautiful. The lift is unique in that it curves along the inside of the copper dome. This changes your balance a bit but that is all. The views are pretty stunning,",
          "Interesting free exhibition inside on the growth, bombing and subsequent rebuilding of Hannover. Stunning views from the top of the dome - well worth the 3Euro lift fee",
          "A historic part of Hannover. Its architecture is absolutely stunning and the view shouldn't be missed. You'll get to see the replica of Hannover before, during, and after the war and present day Hannover. Do not go here and miss going to the top. It is only \u20ac3 for adults and",

          "Inside the big hall you\u00b4ll find models of the city in different times of history but having good weather you should not miss to get a view over the city from the top. The elevator going up is a technical rarity because it doesn\u00b4t go up directly but on a rail connected to the",

          "The building itself is 'just' old majestic rathaus. Anyway there are 2 things why you may visit it: - 4 city models (oldest [hundreds years back] and then before and after 2nd war and modern city) - tower with the best view and funny lift to get there",
          "Love visiting this place for the free bathrooms, classy cafe, amazing models of the city development including the war damage, and the view over the pond and gardens behind it. Best part is the tower elevator for \u20ac3 where you get the best 360\u00b0 view of the city!",

          "We visited this attraction, and had a good look around. It is free entry, and has good disabled access, you can go up the tower for a small fee, but have to queue as they only allow five up at a time. I wouldn't advise it for those with a walking disability as it's a very narrow",
          "It is free to visit, but you must pay if you want to go up the tower. However, it has very strange and exciting diagonally going elevator, and the view is beautiful, so it is definitely worth visiting.",

          "The Hannover City Hall is such a good preserved building that you feel present and the past is coming together. Together with some of the other old church building Hannover is a great place to walk around. It is also close to the Maschsee, which makes it a worthwhile place to",
          "Visited in May. The building itself is impressive and is situated next to an attractive lake. Good views from the top. Thought provoking displays of Hanover before and after the 2 nod world war. Devastation makes you realise both sides suffered badly in this dreadful war",

          "This building is stunning from the inside and out. The front and back are equally spectacular, but the rear with the lakes would be my favourite. Inside they offer 4 miniatures of the city of different stages. The one of post ww2 is very haunting but poignant also. The main",

          "With a guide we were inside the building and saw the maquette that is inside the hall. The archetecture is worth to have a stop here and to go inside. (When it is allowed)",
          "Nearly everything is closed on a Sunday. No hop on, hop bus no shops open. But the Railway stn. Has little shops and loads of cafes so we made our way there but it was a wasted day. my favourite place was Munster. Beautiful churches and plenty of shops and restaurants.",

          "We visited the Rathaus with a 4-year old in tow, and whilst it was extremely interesting to learn about the history of Hannover and it's environs, the 'small person' didn't seem to agree. Which is understandable. That aside, the building is beautiful and has some wonderful,",
          "I stayed at a Hotel a few minutes walk from the Hannover 'Rathaus' whilst in Germany on business and took a walk over one morning to look this magnificent building over. Built in 1901 to 1913 this is a major landmark and attraction with the top of its dome standing reaching",
          "A just superb city hall. A great building inside and out. Beautifull details. Do go inside for the models of old Hannover and informative also of the era of WOII (Hannover was bombed severly) Also go up the central tower for gorgeous views of the city and surroundings",
          "All and all this is a very beautiful building but what people don't realise is they have a canteen in the basement that is open to the General public! Very good value for money and I fully recommend that people come here for lunch! Enjoy",
          "On April 2014 I travelled to Hannover to meet my German friend and I asked him to bring me to the place he wanted to show. He chose City Hall, of course! We bought a ticket to the top of the Dome, I could not remember what the price was but I am sure it's worth for!! Even the",

          "A freebie! How nice! The building is really quite imposing. Interiors are fairly grand. But the best part of it has to be the city models both before and after the bombing. So sad, it almost brought me to tears. Such a shame it had to be bombed. Walking around the city",
          "A must see. The main floor has models of Hannover through out history. The park out back is spectacular!",

          "We visited the City Hall as we wanted to see the lake and found it to be a very interesting visit. This is a lovely, very large building with interesting architecture. There are models showing present day Hannover, the very start of Hannover and Hannover after it was bombed",

          "This is a nice building. The exhibit showing 17th century Hannover, 1939 Hannover, 1945 bombed city and the present day in 4 very detailed models is outstanding. Very powerful. The trip to the top in the elevator is fun too. Unless you're afraid of heights. Then you're in",
          "Ok so this is not specifically the Rathaus but we were there. I find it necessary to review the city or at least the central area where we were located near Lister Platz and Kroepke. We were disappointed to see so many grim faces. These people are not happy. This so a convention",
          "Interesting place to visit and see the maps of the city in the lobby (they show the city at various points in its history--these are not wall maps, but are miniature 3d depictions and fairly good size). Take the elevator to view the city from the tower--its worth the few extra",

          "I was here at the tail end of a long tour around Europe and was too broke to go up the elevator to the tower to see the view. Something I sorely regret. However I will return one day to do this. The grounds are quite cool. We were following the red line guide book and ended up",
          "The NEW City Hall, built in the early 20th century, is a classical design. The 4 exhibition cases in the foyer, showing the history of Hannover, have been painstakingly produced - especially the 1945 post war exhibit - so much detail. Well worth a visit.",

          "This is a world-class place to visit. It takes awile to get to the top, but the view around Hannover, one of Germany's nicest, and most thoughtfully reconstructed cities, is brilliant. But just as impressive are the four miniature recreations of Hannover in the lobby, at four",

          "The most interesting thing in this place are the scenes (models) of how the city was, from ancient times to now.",
          "I walked to the Rathaus from the train station, and spent 30 minutes or so wandering around the building before heading to the surrounding park. The viewing deck was not open when I arrived at the building, so be sure to look into that before you go! However, I really enjoyed",
          "This is one of the most impressive City Halls in Germany. It is really big. Around the City Hall, there is also a lake anda a park, where you can take nice photos. Unmissable.",
          "Enjoy the view from the top and see the Maschsee and Niedersachsenstadion/HDI-Arena where Hannover96 is based. The price of 3\u20ac is also a bargain. But its not only the view, I love the displays of the different stages of Hannover reflecting the change after the wars and how it",
          "This was a wonderful, yet emotional visit for me. It is an amazing building. Although I am deathly afraid of heights, I made it to the top to see the fabulous view. When I looked at the various models of the city & in particular the one post war, I was overcome with emotion. My",
          "Take the bendy lift to the top and enjoy the views - stunning on a clear day! Beautiful building inside and out - if you're lucky you can park right outside too. Welcoming staff and gift shop too.",
          "The building alone is beautiful on the outside, is free to get in and look around and there are several models of the city. Crazy to see how much the city has grown and how much was destroyed during the war. MUST take the elevator up. 3\u20ac to go up, but it's a crazy ride,",
          "I have been visiting Hannover since 1999. My visits have mostly been with school groups on cultural exchanges, but from those visits I have developed a cadre of friends and a true love for the German culture, Hannover style. The Rathaus was one of the first places I visited.",
          "This is a beautiful building with pleasant grounds. Admittance to the building is free but the elevator to the top of the building costs 3 euros. It is worth the price and you get a great view of the City. The models of Hannover from the 1600s to present are also interesting",
          "This was a very lovely little stop on our wanderings around Hanover. Fantastic models inside of the changes to the city over hundreds of years. We also saw some Germans \"washing the steps\", which is a tradition for men who turn 30 and are still unmarried.",
          "This is an imposing building. You must try the unique lift for 3 Euros. It inclines up the dome, the views are good too. I found the 4 models of the city through the ages, very thought provoking, and a bit shocking. I walked the tourist \"red line\", which took me all afternoon,",
          "It is so huge and beautiful you start to consider it may not be the real Rathaus but something else. Its Immensity subjugates you and makes you feel really small in there. And sometimes you may find a SURPRISE if you are ready for it.",
          "This is a beautiful building one should not miss. The entrance is free and for a couple of euros there is the possibility to take a ride with the elevator. This gives you the posibility to view Hannover from above. There are also small hidden things here and there.",
          "Very nice New City Hall. It's very nice and inside and outside. Inside you can see very beautiful architecture, outside amazing view to the New City Hall and park",
          "We happened upon this building as we were spending a few hours in Hannover to break up a long drive. We came upon this magnificent building while having a general walk round and stopped for a look. It is a vast but very impressive building and worth a look if you're in the area.",
          "it is one of the most popular area you have to see in Hannover ,for my first time i just saw it from out side , because it is difficult to understand why it has build because of the language (Deutch) but in the second time i went with one of my best friend who was living there ,",
          "Worth going just for the lift, it bends as it goes up and they very considerately put a glass ceiling and floor in so you can see! Views great from top, and its open, not all caged in. Hall itself very impressive, good town models.",
          "Well worth going up in the lift to the top of the dome (3 euros each). Slightly hard to find out how to get there if you dont speak much german though. Enter through the main doors, take the spiral staircase to the left in the main hall, and its signed from the top of there",
          "Very imposing architecture, lift to the top for great views, very interesting models of Hannover past and present and the best cafe restaurant in the world at the back overlooking the lake.",
          "In order to get to the cuppola you have to take a very small (5 people) lift which goes not straight up but in a curve - this was the first of its kind when built 100 years ago! The view is great. The displays of Hannover in different times (pre and post WWII etc) at the ground",
          "I just love the miniature city (4 different period of time ).to go into the tower costs 3 \u20ac and take the ticket before going up.... The artificial lake near is nice, and all old german things u can see r like in naszism time.",
          "This is well worth a visit to see the models of Hannover through the ages. The dome lift is well worth the money but be prepared if you don't like lifts as this one is generally full and goes up on a slant which is an unusual experience!! The views at the top are amazing. Well",
          "This attraction is probably not for those people with a fear of heights or elevators but it is definitely worth a visit and it only costs 3 euros. At the top of the building is a huge dome and the views from the top are stunning, on a clear day you can see for miles. The best",
          "This is one of the grandest city halls I have ever seen. So grand I thought it must have been the state parliament building.",
          "I didn't go in but the Rathaus itself is big and beautiful. The surrounding area was extremely beautiful as well. Green was everywhere and would be perfect for a morning or afternoon walk.",
          "The city hall (Neues Rathaus) is a must visit place in Hannover. Next to the Maschteich and Maschsee it offers great opportunities to take amazing pictures from outside. The entrance hall has 4 3D models of different periods (current,1939, 1945 and 16xx). If you look up and down",
          "Beautiful architecture and nice view from the top of the tower to see hanover and understand it more. It's strongly recommended but better to have your GF/BF with you i found it really romantic up there for some reason! It happen to be that I was there in the same day of the",

          "I did not go in the building, but I passed through the gardens every day of my stay. It is a beautiful place to walk and take pictures of the building. Too bad people leave their trash laying everywhere after a sunny day. But, the trash receptacles were full. Not sure if",
          "Great way to learn the history of Hannover while also gleaning current wonderful views of the city - the elevator is worth paying for the quick jaunt to the top",
          "While the building is impressive outside and in, the 4 historical diagrams of the city as it existed at various points is also worth studying. Of course it helps you appreciate the destruction of WWII, but its also interesting to see how the city developed over several hundred",
          "This building is awsome. Very nice arquitecture. 4 models inside the building that show the city as it was in 1689, 1933, 1945 and today. Very interesting. Also you can't miss the lift to the tower with the glass floor. Follows the shape of the dome. When you are at the top",
          "I attended an event here and was amazed at how beautiful this building was. Great pre-War & post-War maps of Hanover spanning 100 years. Worth a quick peak.",
          "Beautiful building and interesting exibit in the lobby that shows Hannover before and after WW2. But going to the top of building is a must. You can really see the city from there and the elevator is an experience in of it self.",
          "The City Hall (Rathaus) was almost totally destroyed by the bombing during WW2, as was nearly all of Hannover. The Rathaus like the city has been restored to its former glory.Great care was taken to recreate the City and the Rathaus the way they were. There are two models in the",
          "Hannover City Hall stands beyond a lake which reflects the building like a mirror.Stand on the bridge and enjoy this spectacular building, with its large green dome, and beautiful window detail. On the bridge you will see all the lovely coloured \" Love Locks \" that people have",
          "We went here and got a ticket to go to the top in order to see Hannover from above. I highly recommend it. It is breathtaking to see such a beautiful historical German city and take it all in at once. The red roof tops are all over the city and it is totally worth it.",
          "Hannover-very well known as the city of Trade Fair.A city tour gives you true impression of this city having some heritage building of great architectural beauty.A city of great tradition and culture. Even the Bahnhof(Railway Station) building is so impressive and a tour inside",
          "In a country famous for its city halls,the Hannover's one is one of the most impressive. Located at the very end of a small lake, it has amazing relaxing view and a nice restaurant at the ground floor. I was also impreesed by the four models of the city at different periods",
          "If you're interested in the history of Hannover, it's nice to make a tour in the city hall, in which you can find the models of the city. From the models, you may imagine how the city was devastated in WWII.",
          "Neues Rathaus is an imposing building which was built in 1913, it is in a prominent position in Maschpark and is a 10 minute walk from Hannover Altsadt. The building is one of many in the area and is a great landmark to stop off at when strolling down to Maschsee where the",
          "A very beautiful building by a lake....makes for some nice walks and excellent photos during the evening.",
          "Best thing about the place is you can see set that shows how Hannover was over period of time like Pre-nazi, after Nazi, now etc. Shows you how Hannover has changed over the time. It is located on ground floor. I would not even recommend to go on other floors..",
          "The building is beautiful, both inside and out. Make sure to spend some time exploring the grounds. And the gardens in the back are great for relaxing and enjoying the sunshine. Also, I waited 40 mins in line to go up to the top of the tower, but it was worth it. The elevator",
          "we didn't go inside the building, I think it was closed on the Sunday we visited. Very cool looking building from the outside and very nice park area leading to the lake behind the building.",
          "If going up the lift to the top, go early in the day or you could be waiting on the terrace for quite a while. Worth the wait though. Fantastic views tobe seen over Hannover. Was not expensive. We gained cheaper access by purchasing a Hannover card with discounts.",
          "nice place, full of history. you can see how the city was before and after WWII. behind the Rathaus there is a very nice and beautiful lake.",
          "there is a really quirky lift that goes to the top of the dome which is really worth trying - unless you're afraid of heights",
          "There's a cool elevator that you can take that brings you to the top of the Rathause for a 360 degrees view of the city which was spectacular. The elevator also bends to the dome of the Rathause, which made it cool to be in -- kind of like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.",
          "This is well worth a visit unfortunatly we ran out of time to view to whole of the building. The lift to the tower is the most unusual I have ever been in first the floor slants one way and then it slants the other due to the shaft not bing straight, but when you get to the top",
          "Well worth a visit. There are 4 models of the city on the ground floor detailing the city through the ages, these are intersting and also an eye opener. Next take yourself up to the viewing platforms in the Willy Wolka esq. lift and marvel at the views from the top.",
          "If you're into architecture you should visit the new and the old city hall building",

          "The Rathaus is an important centre of government and is extremely imposing. The foyer has an interesting groups of models of the city over the years but the most moving is the city after the war. 90% of it had been destroyed and the rebuilding has been well done so Hannover is",
          "The city hall, called the New City Hall was built in 1901. Inside you might catch a wedding party. Trips to the tower can have a long wait as only 5 people plus operator can do the elevator which goes up on an incline and has a glass ceiling, floor and walls. On a clear days you",
          "I enjoyed seeing what Hannover looked like over the ages from the mid 1300-s to today. If you have the ability to take panoramic pictures, this is the place to do it!"

        "wiki": "The Marktkirche St. Georgii et Jacobi (Market Church of Sts. George and James), commonly known as Marktkirche (\"The Church on the Marketplace\"), is the main Lutheran church in Hanover, Germany. It was built in the 14th century and, together with the nearby Old Town Hall, is considered the southernmost example of the North German brick gothic (norddeutsche Backsteingotik) architectural style. The roof and the vaults of the naves were destroyed in an air raid in 1943 and restored in 1952.\nThe church is a hallenkirche (hall church). Above the nave and two aisles rises a monumental saddleback roof. The high western tower was a symbol for the power and the wealth of the citizens of the town. It is still one of the highest towers in Lower-Saxony and a landmark of the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Altar ==\nThe main altar was carved of linden wood, around 1480. The front depicts the Passion of Christ in 21 scenes, following models of Martin Schongauer. The back shows scenes from the lives of the two patron saints, Saint George and Saint James. The altar was moved to the Aegidienkirche in 1663 to make room for a Baroque altar. In 1856 it was taken to the Welfenmuseum and thus was not destroyed during World War II.  It was returned to the Marktkirche in 1952.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nAn organ was installed in the turmraum (tower room) of the Marktkirche in 1893, which included parts of an instrument of the 17th century. This organ was destroyed in World War II.\nToday's main organ is at the back wall of the southern aisle. The first instrument in that location was built in 1953 and 1954 by the organ builders Emil Hammer Orgelbau (in German) and Rudolf von Beckerath. It had 61 stops, four manuals and pedal. The prospekt (casing) was designed  by Dieter Oesterlen and is a protected monument.\nFrom 2007 to 2009, the instrument was rebuilt by Goll Orgelbau (Lucerne). The casing and about 50% of the pipes were kept. The new organ has 64 stops, 39 of them mostly using the older material.\n\n\n== Bells ==\nThe Marktkirche has 11 bells. The Christus- und Friedensglocke (Bell of Christ and Peace) is the biggest of Lower-Saxony and is only used on special occasions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Marktkirche (Hannover) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nMarktkirche at MyTravelGuide\nKurze Kirchengeschichte der Altstadt \u2013 short history of the churches in the Old Town, kirche-hannover.de (in German)",

        "wiki": "Hanover Zoo is located in the city centre of Hanover, Germany. The zoo was established on 4 May 1865, and comprises an area of 22 hectares. It contains about 3,414 animals in 237 species, which are cared for by more than 400 employees in the summer season.\n\n\n== History ==\nHanover Zoo is the fifth oldest German zoo. It was established in 1865 with private money. To cover expenses, a stock company was founded. Without any experience in the keeping of wild animals, the company faced significant difficulties and, as a result, losses. It was often visited by local residents.\nDue to the consequences of World War I, ever increasing subsidies by the government were needed to keep the zoo open. In 1920, the city took over, but in 1922, when the zoo was no longer financially viable, it was closed. Two years later, in 1924, due to public pressure and private commitment by the animal trading company Ruhe, it was re-opened with a lions' canyon and monkey rock. In 1932, Ruhe completely took over the zoo and used it as a showcase for their pet shop. Often, the animals were only exhibited for a few weeks before they were sold. \nDuring World War II, the zoo was badly damaged. In 1946, Ruhe restored parts of the zoo provisionally and few animals could be seen until the reopening in 1950. As time passed and with funding from the municipal budget, new enclosures were built for rhinos, elephants, giraffes, antelopes, seals, and penguins. At this time, Hanover Zoo was renowned for its elephant breeding program: 10 Asian and 3 African elephants were born. In 1972, the zoo was again taken over by the city of Hanover.\n\n\n=== Concept Zoo 2000 ===\nIn the early 1990s, the zoo had continuously falling visitor numbers. In 1994, it was converted into a limited company and sold to Hanover Region and work on a new concept started the next year. \u20ac111.9 million has since been invested in the zoo's development.\nSince 2000, more than a million people have visited the zoo annually. In 2005, the Winter-Zoo was introduced, in 2007, the children's paradise Mollywoop was opened, in spring 2010, the Australian Outback and in May 2010, the seventh theme world followed. A Canadian theme world \"Yukon Bay\" was opened, a world record of five Asian baby elephants were born in one calendar year at the zoo, and it received the 2009/10 \u2018Best Zoo\u2019 award. More than 1.6 million people visit every year. \n\n\n== Theme worlds ==\n\nThe different zoo worlds show animals in scenic settings, without visible barriers. A 5 km long explorer path leads through the different exhibits:\n\nZambezi: Zambezi recreates the African savannah. An artificial river runs alongside the giraffes, rhinoceros, flamingos and other animals living in this part of the zoo. Starting at the trading post with on-foot views of the aforementioned animals, visitors travel in small boats for about ten minutes down the river before continuing on foot to the lion, hippo, flamingo, and pelican, meerkat and Sahara desert hoofstock exhibit. At the \"Sahara Conservation Visitor Center\", there is information on the zoo\u2019s addax reintroduction project.\nGorilla Mountain: On the highest point of the zoo, at the end of the evolution trail featuring dioramas of early humans and an abandoned research camp, gorillas inhabit a forest landscape including a stream and a waterfall. At the foot of the mountain exhibit the gibbons, smallest of the apes, live on an island. The exhibit also includes chimpanzees, other apes, and a sloth.\nYukon Bay: An old mine shaft leads to the Canadian theme world Yukon Bay, where wolves, caribous, prairie dogs, and bisons are visible. In the harbour, Henry\u2019s Underwater World in the hull of the sunken \"Yukon Queen\" allows views of diving polar bears, seals, and penguins. Yukon Bay was built in collaboration with the Yukon Territory (Canada).\nJungle Palace: An Indian rainforest exhibit themed as an abandoned Hindu temple with Asian elephants, tigers, leopards, hanuman langurs, and snakes.\nOutback: There is an exhibit themed as an Outback farm featuring kangaroos, wombats, emus, wallabies, and a flock of Australian birds in an aviary themed as a pub.\nMullewapp (Mollywoop): Mullewapp is an exhibit aimed at children with a petting meadow, secret biology room, and toboggans. It is the location of meet and greets with the \"Three Friends\" by author Helme Heine.\nMeyer's Farm: Seven old Lower Saxony half-timbered buildings dating back to the 19th century and earlier, re-erected in the zoo, create the setting for Meyer's Farm and are used to house rare old domestic breeds like red and white Husum protest pigs, Pomeranian rough-wool sheep, and Exmoor ponies.\nWinter-Zoo (seasonal): During the Christmas season, the theme worlds Meyer's Farm, Mollywoop, and Yukon Bay are decorated. Activities available in this season include ice-skating, ice curling, roundabouts, and tobogganing.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nHanover Zoo is also involve in conservation efforts through multiple programs:\n\nProjects in collaboration with the Sahara Conservation Fund: the Hanover Zoo is involved in a European breeding project for the North African Ostrish and the Addax, also participating in the reinsertion of both species of animal in their natural habitat in North Africa. The project is done in partnership with the Sahara Conservation Fund and many other zoological parks and centers in the world.\nPolar Bear International: the Hanover Zoo is funding the tracking of a polar bear near the Hudson Bay in Canada since 2008 to better study the comportment and migration route of the animals and better help in their conservation through the Polar Bear International organisation.\nRettet den Drill eV or Save the Drills: Hanover Zoo is working with Rettet den Drill to save drills populations of Nigeria and Cameroun. The American organisation Pandrillus also provides support in their endeavor to both protect the species and breed animals populations in zoos.\nProtection of the Asian Elephant with the Biodiversity and Elephant Conservation Trust: the Hanover Zoo is working with BECT, an NGO from Sri Lanka, in order to protect the Asian Elephant and educate the populations about the situation of the animal. The zoo also has a successful breeding program for the Asian elephant.\nConservation of old and endangered breeds: the Hanover Zoo also participate in the conservation of European endangered breeds of domestic and farm animals in partnership with the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gef\u00e4hrdeter Haustierrassen e.V. or GEH. In their efforts of participation, the zoo raises many of these breeds in their petting zoo, helping to conserve the genetic diversity of European livestock. Amongst other, the zoo has Harzer Rotvieh cattles, Thuringian goats,  German Black Pied cattles, Pomeranian Coarsewool sheep, German faverolle chicken, and many others.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGeneral information on the Winter Zoo\nHanover Zoo at Zoo-Infos.de (in English)\nResults Park Scout Award 2009/2010 (in German)\nFurther information on the zoo's concept;\n[1]\n[2]",

          "Really memorable and exciting. Equally enjoyable for all age groups right from 5 to 70. The white boar and underwater collection are worth seeing - one to one. Twitting birds of various colours is added feature. Tiger with their cubs \u2026",

The decor, the design of the paths and the attention to details really helps to immerse yourself into this new world. Sadly it is pretty expensive but in my opinion it is still totally worth it.",

          "Something for the entire family and a lot to see, with nicely designed animal enclosures, a live show and guided tours. The park is easy to reach by public transport in the middle of the state capital. The entry fee is perhaps one of the few downsides, as well as limited parking.",

          "A must go if you have time to visit it while in Hannover. The animals can be seen in pens which are very similar to their natural habitat. There is a lot of effort put into ensuring you are as close to the animals as safely possible. We got to see the seal show in the Yukon stadium which was a treat. Highly recommended to visit ",
          "What a fantastic zoo, they have really thought about where these animals are from and created areas just like their home countries. A miss see for any age wanting to see a zoo.",

          "visited here with work colleagues and had a great meal, lots of choice of traditional german food and great service, well worth a visit even if you are not actually going to the zoo!!!",
          "With my family We jad amazing fun there. Elephants were blowing water so spectacularly... I have never expected that I will see something so beautiful there. For us it was like a visit inside the jungle. We felt really sure and comfortable.",
          "This is by far the best Zoo I have ever seen. Even San Diego is not close. Take the Sambesi-river - raft, see the polar bears REALLY close. Every minute is worth the time.",
          "We visited on a rainy day in August which actually made the experience better in many ways. Due to the weather conditions there were very few people here on this day so it made the tour more relaxing and we got to see far more of the animals without the crowds. Loved the",
          "I love animals and as such as i dont like them to be treated badly , but its a zoo . Zoos are there to help preserve our planets inhabitants. Anyway. Great place to bring kids of all ages. There is a preplanned route that you can follow. Very easy. Decent places to eat and good",
          "on Saturday the price for adult was 25EUR it was a nice and organized zoo, variety in the animals but was OK it didn't offer more than a regular zoo.",
          "It's not the biggest zoo and it hasn't the biggest variety of animals.( Berlin zoo has it)This is a zoo that's been thoughtfully taken care of - each area has its own theme. Also there's a small (free) boat ride! If you are in Hannover with children, this is the no 1 place",
          "I am disgusted in how you treat your Elephants. God knows what else you do to the other poor animals. Abusing/forcing them to do tricks for your own selfish reasons so you can bring in money. Shameful! What gives us a right as humans to treat animals like that?!",
          "There is building work at the entrance right now but does not cause problems. There is a relaxed feel to the zoo. Many kind staff. Many happy children enjoying the zoo today. The free boat ride was a real treat. Worth having a go. It is ok to go round as many times as you",
          "This is a zoo that's been thoughtfully taken care of - each area has its own theme, and there's even a small (free) boat ride! I won't say that it has the most variety of animals, but it's really worth a visit. Easily spent 3 hours there without knowing it. Oh, and you may",
          "We visited the zoo with friends and while we thought it a tad expensive at 25\u20ac each we enjoyed our visit. The highlight was visiting Henry the Polar bear. He enclosure is fantastic he has plenty of space and and a deep pool with wave action. It's one of the best exhibits we",
          "Zoo has a huge and nice area with a great variety of animals (I miss birds). All environments look like movie sets. Sometimes, having so many furnitures and scenery makes harder to see the animals due to small space to accomodate everybody who is visiting the zoo. There is a",
          "We visited the zoo on a busy holiday Monday in June. The zoo had obviously spent what must have been a considerable amount of money, time and effort to create well thought through, suitable habitats for the animals. Food outlets and entertainment for the children were very good.",
          "My wife and I visited the zoo in Hannover while we were here for a long weekend. We used our Hannover card to travel there, and then got a \u20ac3 discount per entry ticket. I've been to a number of zoos in my life and this one is right up there with the best. The range of animals",
          "This wasn't the cheapest day out by any measure but this was one of those defining points in my wife and children's lives that they WILL not forget. The zoo itself is undergoing some improvement work and thus from the outside it doesn't look the best. I would also say that",
          "I've heard bunch of very postiv opinions about the zoo among locals. I decided to visit it with friends in February. I did not have the experience I expected. The animal seemd unhappy and bored. This may be due to the winter period, lets see if I will try this again.",
          "I couldn't believe what an amazing zoo Hannover had to offer! First, we went on a boat ride through the Africa section of the zoo. A must do. Takes only 12 minutes and you go by the zebras, giraffes, and more. We saw lions, leopards, and so many elephants with their babies!!",
          "We visited the zoo with the intention of seeing my wife's favourite, the wallabies but when we got there they were probably taking an afternoon nap! However the other animals and the settings more than made up for the disappointment.",
          "I was expecting to see a huge area filled with many animals. Even though there are many different species, it wasn't exactly what I was waiting. If you visit it, make sure you attent the seals performance.",
          "The zoo is really amazing! I liked that for each section there is a different theme, it was awesome. Also we managed to catch quite a number of shows, no wonder we spent almost half of the day there. :)",
          "This is the best zoo I've ever been to. It's had lots of investment over the last decade or so and the themed areas are very special and make you feel like you're on a trip abroad - the African area with the Sambesi boat ride, the Yukon Bay Area which houses wolves, polar bears,",
          "Visited in Feb but would like to go again but in summer as you get to see more and do more. It was still a nice day to go and explore the zoo. It took about two hours to see everything although you could spend much longer. Definitely recommended if you are going to Hannover",
          "The animals are so unhappy. It's sad to see them like this. It was the the first time at the zoo for me and definitely the last one.",
          "We go to loads of Zoos. We didn't really plan on Hannover Zoo, we thought we would go to a different one that we had researched, but this was closer. You can get the metro out to the zoo, which is a quick and pleasant journey. The zoo is quite spread out, so there is much",
          "I visited the Zoo for the first time after four years living in hannover and I wish I did it before. It is a nice place. I have only gone in summer time and you could see all the animals. The polar bear is amazing to watch sumerge in the water. I was told by friends that went in",
          "We visited the zoo as a family, three children and two adults. The entrance fee was very reasonable. There is a vast range of animals to see and the enclosures are constructed in such a way that you get great views. For example the Hippo enclosure is glass fronted so you get to",
          "This zoo is really fun! Make sure you make it in time for all their shows! They are sure cool and fun! (They are all in German but you can still have a fun time if you don't know German) Their animals seem to be having a better life than other zoos I've been to!",
          "This isn't the place to visit during winter months, as we found out. The price is still 19.50Euro each, which is rather steep, considering how little there is to see and do. It would have been nice to be told that most parts are closed or being renovated. We visited last year",
          "I enjoy this zoo,every time i come and visit. The africa part is what i like most about it. Cool animals",
          "Visited the Zoo on 30 November which is Winter season. Opening hours are 10am - 4pm. The entry still costs \u20ac19.50 pp which is expensive considering many of the attractions and enclosures are closed or being renovated. Very few people visiting but it was very cold - even the",
          "My partner and I had a day to kill in Hannover - so we decided to visit the zoo. I wasn't really expecting much but it was probably the best zoo I have ever been to. Personal highlight was the boat ride, which takes you around part of the zoo. A really lovely way to spend an",
          "Unfortunately we only got to see the polar bear being fed, because we went there late, nevertheless it was an amazing experience, the zoo stood out because it reminded me of an old western movie place, saloon like, and the lights outside was very pretty.\\ The restaurant was",
          "I'm not a fan of zoos always but I know they do a lot of good work with conservation. We enjoyed the trip around the little waterway but on the whole I felt the gorilla looked really sad and bored and barged up to window and shoulder barged it and also the polar bear enclosure",
          "One of the best Zoos you can find in Germany. The Zoo is going a longterm transformation from a former visitor centric Zoo with bad condutions for the animals to a entertaining Zoo where animals are treated with equivalent rights. The animals live in thematic enclosures, have",
          "The zoo offers a great variety of animals and puts a great deal of effort (and investment) into creating attractive environments (Yukon, Africa, India, etc.). They also have a very nice restaurant and beer garden, Meyer's Hof, that you can sometimes get to without paying the",
          "Thanks for this place beutifull animal inside.. I advice the poeple to go there With children because the place to play",
          "Visited alone when on aholiday from australia. Great zoo worth a visit even for an adult, enclosures are really well made and lots of different animals compared to other zoos i have seen! Worth watching the polar bear feeding if you are there at that time, it is in german but",
          "If you are looking for something to do in Hannover with or without kids/babies, zoo is the best choice.",
          "We found this zoo perfect and complete. Beautiful places and locations had been designed very good according to genre, type of each animals. I suggest to each people who has interests on nature and wild life, to spend enough time more than 6 hours to can get a complete tour in",
          "It was very cold when we went but the zoo was really quiet because of this and the fact it was a school day in Germany There were a lot of different animals and you could get a good view of them all.The kids really enjoyed it and the food in the cafe was reasonable. There were",
          "We went to this zoo with my 6yr old grandson. I don't agree with zoo's generally, but he wanted to see a polar bear. A good day out it has to be said but a zoo is a zoo, and a cage no matter how well its kitted out, still remains a cage. We arrived about 11am and stayed all day",
          "We have small kids and visit the zoo about once every 1-2 years. This was our 4th and last visit. It is an absolutely over priced activity (\u20ac87 for a family of 4). There are 3 major things wrong with this place: 1. People are allowed to smoke and they do it everywhere. 2. The",
          "really good zoo.loved the different themed areas.zambezi river,yukon area(including polar bears),india and then Australia.it was well thought out and easy to get around.didnt get lost and spent all day there",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by Erlebnis Zoo even though some of the animals, such as the Giraffes and Zebras weren't present do to problems with their terrain. We have visited the zoo in Hamburg for the last couple of years, where theirs is a really pretty well kept zoo,",
          "A very enjoyable visit to the adventure Zoo in Hannover. Great attractions - India themed elephant enclosure, Alaskan themed polar station as well as a great play ground with adventure castle and massive sand pit! All this is rounded up in the end with a beautiful Farmers range",
          "We have been to a lot of different zoos, but this one is overall the best one we have been to so far! This was our second time here. t has a lot of great attraction for the kids (ours are 3,5,7 years old), and you get really close to the animals. We love it!",
          "We saw a make believe African School and a village. We learnt that there are 3 types of zebras. There were lions, zebras, penguins, even leopards and elephants. You could touch ivory. I would recommend this to everyone. Yukon Bay had a lone wolf - quite literally. We also",
          "So we go to a lot of zoos - in all sorts of places. And this one was really very nice. Not huge but lovely layout and decent selection of animals. The Yukon bit and the Indian sections are both really impressive and wouldn't look out of place in a world class theme park. And -",
          "I have been to a lots of zoos and I have to say that this zoo is up there with the best. I loved the fact that I could take photos of so many of the animals without having to take the shot through glass. The different themed areas work really well and I loved the Zambezi boat",
          "Spent the whole day around this fantastic, massive,well maintained zoo. I've been to the zoo in munster and this one dwarfs it. Animals seem to be well cared for and the whole place is so clean. All staff seem to be educated in the paticular animals they care for and friendly",
          "Visited the Zoo in early December to enjoy the Christmas Market, which was excellent, and much better than the other Christmas Markets scattered around Hannover town centre! Although small, the atmosphere around the various bars and stalls that were situated around the ice rink",
          "The Zoo is well-designed: classified animals according to continents : Africa, India, Canada....even toilets are built according to their districts. Interesting. The Zoo is not that big, half day is enough for young people or it is nice for family with kids to spend a day.",
          "Spent a wonderful afternoon here. Easy to get to, drive or just take the subway which stops right by the front entrance. Very easy to walk about everywhere and well designed layout. Has the whole range of animals from polar bears to gorillas, to tigers, to elephants, you name",
          "I love zoos. Have been to zoos all over North America and Europe. This is one of the very best and it isn't really given much notice in the guide books and reviews. Truly wonderful! Animals are depicted in more natural habitats often in with compatible animals. The animals",
          "The zoo in Hannover is devided into several so called \"worlds\" each with a theme/continent where you will find the animals living there. Most of the parts have been renovated since 2000 and they are still renovating to make it even better. I especially love the part called",
          "Set out with themed attractions such as the Yukon - a mine plus rocky water with merchant ship built in to it and with wave machine. showed off well the polar bear (saw only one who seemed happy enough) unlike Rhino (also only saw one) that exhibited some repetitive walking",
          "has all kinds of animals: Moneky house, zebras, giraffe, rhinos (difficult to spot), elephants, tiger, leopard, hippo, many birds. Excellent playing ground for children (jumping nets, climbing castle, etc.)",
          "The zoo is well kept and animals are not kept in cages but in enclosed spaces with a scenery mimicking their normal environment. We attended the shows which were interesting although we could not understand much given that everything was in German. The only annoying thing was",
          "This is a well- planned and set Zoo that offers a lot of interesting animals and activities for children in a nice setting. Like every Zoo in Germany , the topically arranged gastronomy is very expensive and no one can dodge the small snackbars; ICE AND TOFFEE STANDS with three",
          "I absolutely love the Hannover Zoo. It is more \"real\" than most other ones that I have visited over the years. There are several varieties of animals to see and they are not enclosed in small areas like other zoos that I have seen. I went to this zoo 4 times when I lived in",
          "A zoo visit is a must on any trip! This place is much better than others in Germany (like Bremerhaven) with a decent range of well looked after animals. The underwater world is nice, and the sea lions have a huge pool and wave machine - they really did look like they were having",
          "For anyone who likes zoos this is a must on your calendar when visiting Hanover. The zoo is beautifully laid out lots of sights and events for all ages. The large selection of animals and their surroundings are very interesting and cater for all interests, especially those of",

          "This zoo is a must do in the city. Easy to arrive is a great plan with family or firends. The animals are beautiful and well care. It is a place to learn and know different species due to their great areas and information. The elephant\u00b4s area is amazing and also the tour by",
          "I spent 5 hours in the ZOO with my little sons and my mom. Everything is perfectly organized, animals have plenty of space and seem to be really well cared. I can imagine spending the whole day there, each part of the ZOO has a different topic that fully catches your attention,",
          "We went the last days of the winter season and it surprised us the wellness of most of the animals. In general they had big places to live in. A zoo designed for kids. Since the entrance doors this zoo is designed to allow the kids have a natural and a great experience.",
          "It's a must if you like animals and nature! Very well organized and the animals living in unter very good conditions,they care about them. The only \"bad\" thing, It says that it close at 18.00 but when we are visit at November, they start from 16.30 to close the animals in",
          "The Zoo is one of the best i have been to - including san diege - Leipzig & Hamburg - nearly none of the small cages from the early times of the \"Zoo Business\" is left over",
          "An extremely good zoo with lots of animals on show. The emphasis is on natural surroundings for the animals with best possible viewing. Feeding times and shows are well publicized and frequented. On the whole well worth a repeat visit several times a year. The winter zoo is a",
          "Not a very big but very accurate and well-organized Zoo. Never seen such happy animals. To avoid stay in the line to pay parking fee - better to pay at the Zoo exit but not at 3-storey Parking.",
          "It's an adventure parc, a zoo, a great place to eat and have fun, great for those who have kids too. The entrance fee is 25\u20ac but it's worth every penny especially when u think that it' s all for the animals and for aranging those beautiful areas with different themes. The",
          "...very expensive. EUR 25,00 is the entrance fee for a adult. You get to see awesome animals and scenery, but still it's to expensive.",
          "Easily the best zoo I have ever visited. I was amazed at the way they have sectioned it into themed areas such as Africa, Canada, and Australia. It is not just a collection of animals, it is much more than that.",
          "Smallish zoo with a novel approach to showing off their animals. They have zones, like the Yukon zone for their seals, wolves and polar bears. The Indian zone was particularly well done with a family of elephants. Worth a visit.",
          "Zoo great loads of animals,places to eat quite reasonable and large,two could share. Shows and displays,nice little boat ride free included in entry price 20 euros,you can spend a full day.",
          "Spent the whole day at the zoo. Cost 25.00 to get in and I was expecting a normal zoo, I have never been so wrong, it has areas of the world that even look like where they ar supposed to be, in the first area Africa, there is a river with automatic boats that take you round and",
          "First of all its easy to get there. The zoo it self are so convenient to walk. There are no single of boring moment. The areas splits are absolutely grate. There's a lot of places to stop and eat . The fidding area is so fun for the young children. The only problem is that's the",
          "Spent the day here. Lots of different things to see and do. There is a boat that takes you around some of the exhibits. The Yukon Bay Area is great with the polar bears swimming. The American show is good but I won't spoil it by saying anymore!!",
          "It is quite an interesting place to visit. I must say, I wasn't in such an zoo and it looks really great. There are still some things to sort out, to renew or rebuild but all in all, a nice place. Only thing that remains bitter after visiting is the price. I understand that it",
          "Visited this zoo the other day and it is so good that my 4 yr old loved it. Much better then the zoo i been to in London my home town. The boat ride was wicked... I had to speed up my visit as we was driving back to england but i could of stayed there all day without my son",
          "When I was taking part in my German exchange, we decided to visit the zoo. I assumed that the animals are probably going to have a very limited amount of space, and it would most definitely much up to the London Zoo, however, I was proven wrong. The animals were treated with",
          "We visited family in Hildesheim for a week in August and on one of the days decided to visit Hannover Zoo, WOW. It's a fantastic zoo with lots to see and do, and the animals are obviously looked after very well, we were lucky enough to watch the feedings of the Polar Bear,",
          "Last December I had the opportunity to visit Hannover/Germany (I live in Las Vegas). One late afternoon my sister took me to the Hannover Winter Zoo (called Winter Zoo during that time of the year). I was questioning her mental health - who on earth wants to go in the dark at 27",
          "We really enjoyed in Hannover Zoo. Boat tour was perfect and the ticket price include it also. However, i couldn't see crocodiles. I will recommend everyone to visit this zoo when their Hannover visiting...",
          "A good sized zoo that's well laid out and with lots to see. The kids really enjoyed themselves. Already looking forward to our next visit.",
          "This zoo is well laid out, with many interesting animals. I really appreciated the many opportunities given to hear zoo keepers talk about the animals while feeding them. The sea lion show was also very good.",
          "Great experience! The animals seemed like well taken care of and they had plenty of room. Polar bear was my absolute favorite! Also the seal/eagle show was great!",
          "I was there on a solo business trip but I was just thinking how much better if I had the family with me. It's a nice well kept zoo, though I think some animals might be a bit shy or nocturnal animals - I couldn't find them in their closures. The small animal shows are pretty",
          "Not the largest zoo but very well designed and layer out. Great themed enclosures tho some could be bigger (orangatan's and big birds). There is a fun boat ride and great lay areas for the kids scattered throughout the park to keep the little ones entertained. Food areas clean,",
          "The zoo is very park-like...very nice to visit just for a walk. Animal enclosures simulate wild habitats. Interaction via feedings, etc. Downside is that the zoo is expensive for daytrippers.",
          "Hannover zoo is very nice. I visited the zoo with my friends. They have a large variety of animals and birds. It's good to go to the zoo if visiting Hannover.",
          "Very nice animal displays and a lovely park layout. Way too expensive. Only reason we went was because of a gift card we got.",
          "The exhibits were clean and well designed for the animal. Boat ride was nice. The animals were all active so they were fun to watch. All the signs are in German as were the shows. But you can get the gest of it.",
          "It is a wonderful zoo, the settings are marvellous even when not without mistake as the Siberian Tiger in the Indian setting or very short descriptions on the animals. In that, there are much better Zoos around. What, however is really impressive is the larger settings like the",
          "I travelled quite a distance to visit this zoo as I had heard it was supposed to show animals in their natural habits... If that's what you can call small areas just painted to look real. The fact that this zoo prides itself on giving the animals natural surroundings made it so",
          "Good for kids,family and small group from school. Not too large zoo park as space but it is full with kind of animal. The designer of the park is smart , he take benefit of all the space and produce a very lovely zoo. I visited it in 4 hours and I watched the shows of see life",
          "we have been planning on visiting this zoo for sometime already, we managed to visit this last weekend. the weather was okay, a bit rain shower in the morning but enough sun to keep it warm. we expected that it will be full on Sunday but its just enough crowd, no waiting queue",
          "I came with my girldfriend, because we read that it was a very nice zoo, and we hadn't been to one for a long time. The entry was 25\u20ac for adults, and in my opinion, it is expensive; otherwise the zoo is very clean and with a great variety of animals from different continents.",
          "We had looked at what to do whilst in Hannover and came across the zoo. Thought haven't been to a zoo for years so why not. We were not disappointed. The queue to get in wasn't too bad as it was still holiday time. We were given a guide in English which was good and vey helpful!",
          "I visited Hannover zoo twenty years ago and though it was special. I visited again this month (April 2015) and it blew my mind away. This is by far the best attraction I have been to in a long time. Don't be put off by the ticked price of \u20ac25. It's worth twice that. Their is",
          "We truly loved this zoo. It's quiet big, lots of different well known animals like lions, polar bears, giraffes, bisons, wolves buy also smaller animals like snakes and wombats. Highlight for us were the polar bears and the lions, lots of new borns as well!",
          "Best Zoo visited ever. We do not have kids but for us it was a complete surprise and an outstanding experience. For the first time I did not feel sorry for the animals, instead you are happy to know how much love and care is given to all of them by trying to have the most",
          "I visited with a party of school children & we were all very impressed. It has been designed exceptionally well. Thr facilities, even in February, were very good. The highlight was watching the polar bear dive into the water & swim - just incredible .",
          "We believe to know a fair bit about animal care and health. We also have 2 young animal loving children of 5 and 6 years. This is in both respects the best Zoo / animal park we have visited. It is fun for the kids, for more than one day. The animals are kept extremely well and",
          "I visited in winter which is challenging. But most of the amimals were out and about. The path layout makes sure you see everything. Summer would be the best time but it was a good use of an hour or two on a winters day. Easy to get there as the train stops right next to it.",
          "Visited with family in Dec 14. Fantastic experience. Elephant area and Yukon were highlights. Winter area was fantastic too (markets, ice skating, sledding etc.). would definitely recommend to families with young kids.",
          "yes, I know, that is quite a statement. And I am a regular visitor of Zoo's around the world. But when the world exhibition came to Hannover, they really remade this Zoo completely and it is great. They created artifical landscapes for the animals to live in. You have parts of",
          "I really like this Zoo. Good attractions, nice shows and setups. For kids it is a must. Prices are reasonable.",
          "Was a lovely zoo, great set up, variety was excellent not badly priced at all. And the trips and shows were very well run. The boats on river was brilliant",
          "I think this was one of the best ways to spend a day at Hannover! In the heart of the city (train 10) if I'm not wrong takes you to the Zoo! The animals have been kept well, fed on time, and they allow pets to visit as well!! Very clean and tidy, the maps guide you well inside",
          "The Hannover zoo is an amazing place. I was really impressed to see the animals kept in a near natural enclosure. The zoo map makes it very easy to locate the animals in a well arranged natural clusters like zanzibar, australia, india, underwater life and yukon bay. the",
          "Went to the zoo with mixed views as a zoo in a city sounds a bit strange. The price was very reasonable and so was the cost of activities/food. A really good selection of the big and small animals, all very easy to get up close to. The recreation of natural habitats was at times",
          "The Zoo is One of the Mixer Zoos i have visited, but the price is rather high. And even though they are trying to make the place ok for the animals, it still feels like it's not quite enough. But maybe that's just my opinion as I am not really a 'zoo person'. I am sure the kids",
          "The Hannover Zoo is not a classical Zoo with Animals in Cages, instead it is following the concept of an adventure Zoo. It is separated into different Continents. In Africa, you can take a tour with a boat and experience the animals in their environment. The new created Yukon",
          "I love Zoo's, and being a solo travellor (and not a very confident one!), I wanted something easy to do. The zoo was very short taxi ride from my hotel (Suite Novotel) and cost 8 euros. None of the entrance signs were in English which was a shame, so I joined a que and hoped",
          "The Berlin Zoo may be more famous, but it the Hannover Zoo is far superior. (Berlin Zoo looks like it hasn't changed in 60 years, with the traditional feeling of animals being imprisoned.) What we love about this zoo is the themed areas -- like Yukon Bay, which is brilliant.",
          "I went to several zoos in Germany but hannover zoo was the best especially with good weather that you could attend some live shows. I really recommend it however it is too expensive",
          "Just got back from visiting the Zoo it was a perfect stop over location on the way back from the in laws in Poland on the way to Europort to catch the ferry home. Arrived at opening time after a short walk from our hotel and it crossed my mind... Have I made a wise decision?",
          "One of the best zoos I've been to in this part of Europe. Very organized and easy to navigate. The highlights for us and our 7yo were: the boat ride, the Indian courtyard and the elephants, the polar bear, and the gorillas. The sea world show is nice even if the voiceover is",
          "Visited in June, was not crowded. Huge and very natural looking. Zambesi part was my favorite with the boat ride around. (Queues might be long in peak season.) Lots of exotic trees/bushes/flowers. Also the polar bear/seal/pinguin area was very natural. Feedings/shows are several",
          "this is one of the greatest places to be seen in Hannover , it is really fantastic area to see such kind of different animales , clean natural area , very good planned area for such kind of zoo , as it was between large forest and clean green area , clean oxygenated air ,",
          "The Hannover Zoo is a great place to visit when in Hannover with children but not only. Great attractions nice arrangements, all in all a fun day out for the kids and adults alike. The boat ride is very nice and the fact that you can at times get really close to the animals,",
          "Hannover Zoo is a fantastic day-trip for the whole family. The zoo itself is dedicated to keeping their animals happy and stimulated, and their main aim is to educate their visitors about the animals that they house. Each exhibit is expertly suited to the animal it contains,",
          "One of the best zoos that I have visited. The boat ride was very relaxing. Good choice on a sunny day and reasonably priced.",
          "Ok didn't go in. Should have checked prices before travelling there. 25 Euros per adult means that this zoo is for adults with lots of spare money. Not me then!",
          "It have lots of activities. The show of the penguin and also the restaurant was awesome. I will recommend that to anyone that have kids.",
          "Whoever designed this zoo deserves a medal - it's absolutely amazing. Rather than having the 'typical' zoo feel with a lot of enclosures in metal / concrete, there are different zones in the zoo and each zone has been designed amazingly well so that you really feel you are in",
          "Turning mid winter, on a shower ridden afternoon we were worried, but should not have been as town zoos go this is by far the nicest I have been to. Split into zones there was plenty to keep us occupied for 4hrs. The animals look well looked after, the surrounding are amazing",
          "The Polar Bears are great and the fact that they allow dog into the zoo makes it interesting as the big cats want to eat them. The elephants were great, attempting to move a massive balls over a log. It showed how clever they were and how persistent, not that the poor elephant",
          "We are holders of annual tickets and are regular visitors every time we are surprised by something great place to visit.",
          "On a weekend visit to Hannover decided on a trip to the zoo. I was expecting a small concrete place as you find with a lot of small urban zoos. I could not have been more wrong!!!! It was amazing. Although small, it takes less than an hour to walk round the whole place, the",
          "When travelling to visit my military boyfriend in Hannover, we had nothing to do one Sunday and as most things are closed, we decided to take a trip to the zoo. I wasn't expecting a lot. Usually inner city zoos lack charm and personality but this was something else! We went",
          "Went to the zoo on a cold November day. Was pretty kicked to catch a lot of animals up close, due to the Plexiglas viewing windows. However the polar bears were not there :( Big bummer! In-fact the whole arctic section was closed off. I as an Indian, loved the huge section",
          "The zoo is one of Hannovers main attractions. We really enjoyed the ambience and the many animals around.",
          "Amazing Zoo or better to say more like a Theme Park with the different sections which reflect different parts of the world. In Summer the river tour is great fun and in Winter the Xmas Market is a nice place to have a Gluehwein.",
          "We visited this lovely zoo on 27th November 2013. It was a cold but dry day and we fully understand the limitations of visiting a zoo in the middle of winter as many of the animals are kept indoors for obvious reasons. Our visit was during refurbishment work of the polar bears",
          "I was in the Zoo Hannover several times as couple and also with 2 children. It is always an interesting experience... especially for kids.",
          "Very beautiful area, a little expensiv. The presentation of animals is excellent. Play areas for enfants and toddlers.",
          "Don't expect to see a vast array of species, but the ones here are amazing, in fantastic surroundings. The Zoo is broken up into different zones, with features abound. For example, the elephant enclosure is superb, with lots of space for the animals and surroundings that make",
          "I didn't have much luck when it comes to weather, it was a rainy day. We decided to go to zoo anyway and it was a great decision. Entry costs 25 EUR per adult, but it was worth. Whole place is organized in a themes, so during the trip you are a traveller through Africa",
          "I visited the zoo when I lived in Hannover and wasn't impressed. It is much improved and a pleasure to visit. Love the Yukon area with the polar bears and underwater viewing.",
          "I've not been to hundreds of zoos or anything, but this is easily the best. We were thinking of going to the zoo in Berlin to see polar bears, but a local in Hannover told us that the zoo in Hannover was much better, and that it also had polar bears. I've not been to the Berlin",
          "This is by far the best zoo I have been too. There is an interesting assortment of animals from all over the world. It was a great afternoon!",
          "This is a very nice zoo, clean and easy to visit. The boat ride was fun for the kids, and you can see lions, giraffes and other animals VERY CLOSE, which is exciting. We can't help but feel sad for the chimps, whose cage was over-crowded. The other primates also seemed to need",
          "Great settings for the animals. For example, the elephants live in an old Indian temple and the polar bears live in an old abandoned Yukon whaling station. They use plexiglass to great effect at this zoo so you really can get remarkably close to the animals. Strange that they",
          "My brother and I visited this zoo on our trip to Germany recently and quiet enjoyed it, I especially liked the themed areas the zoo has, for example putting the polar region animals in the Yukon Bay Area, and the boat ride through the African experience, it's an easy zoo to",
          "I love this zoo - I have visited it 4-5 times. They have done an amazing job of the exhibits - the food is a little pricy but to be expected within a zoo.",
          "This zoo was fabulous for kids. It had about 20 separate areas. tree house, eating areas, trampolines, grasslands and parks and that is over and above the animals! There was a great boat ride through the Africa part of the zoo. We also really liked that the zoo aimed to add",
          "Interesting deco of enclosures surrounded by lovely forest. Zoo keepers well versed and knowledgeable and important to support places that look after the animals well.",
          "A zoo that is small enough not to get bored but big enough to have a good selection of animals. Animals look well cared for and appear to have adequate space. Loved the Polar bears and Meercats. I thought it was good value at 25 eoros for an adult. Did not have the food so",
          "a must see when in Hannover, can bee done in 4 hours, but I recomend to use a day if weather is good, lots of shows and great for kids.",
          "It hav, by far, the best infrastructure, the animals are in large enough spaces, and the tematic zones are briliantly prepared. Pure AWSOMNESS :)",
          "Went to this zoo a few months back for the afternoon. Easy to get too and really good value for money. We loved going into the petting zoo and picking up the goats (inner child in me) and the zoo was really easy to get around. I can imagine its a great place to take the family",
          "Well laid out, lots of shows and things to do, a good day out for all the family, although a touch expensive when compared to places like London Zoo",
          "This zoo was brilliant and is well worth a visit. We spent the whole day here and there was lots to do. The food was of a very good standard and not to expensive. The 7 different zones were well thought out and very well designed even down to the toilets. All the animals looked",
          "I suppose as zoos go, it is worthvisiting for a day out for want of anything better to do with kids in Hanover. II am not a particular fan of zoos, so my review is biased. However, kids really enjoy the water ride, Yukon, and proximity to the animals. the shop is also quite",
          "This is a wonderful Zoo with or without children so much to see and do. The boat trip is well worth the wait in the queue. The Yukon are is quite spectacular.",
          "This is probably the best zoo I have visited. It is quite expensive (25 euro each) but we spent about 6 hours here and I would say it is worth the price. It is divided into different areas (Australia, Yukon etc) and each of them has been brilliantly designed and landscaped.",
          "I have now visited this zoo 3 times. It's great, particularly the polar bear exhibit and the elephants. There are lots of places to eat which are all very reasonably priced. A great day out, well worth every penny.",
          "This zoo has loads of really exciting animals. My particular favourite were the elephants but the big cats, polar bears, monkeys, wolves seals and the Zambezi river tour. Although they did put penguins in the \"Yukon Bay\" which isn't exactly geographically correct... All the",
          "Despite the small size zoo there some great attraction such as a couple of days old baby giraffe...Really nice , the seals, and the white panthers jumping around.",
          "I have 4 kids of varying ages and seem to hit so many zoos over the years wherever we go. This is by far the best zoo ever so far. Other zoos in the area fall away under this blaze of glory. Ok so the food drink and souvenirs are expensive but that's seems quite normal for",
          "It was very nice with all the snow. There was also a sleigh-track for free for the kids. Easy to reach with one of the buses/trams. There is also a cafeteria where you can order all sorts of different fast foods, although a bit pricey, not nor more than you would pay at any",
          "This is the best zoo which I visited; the zoo is a little bit out from Hannover but it worth to see it. when you step in you are like the middle of a jungle. You don't have the feeling that those wild animals are not at home. I saw pelicans unleashed, jumping on alley - really",
          "We spent a day with our kids three years ago and they were so amazed that we had to visit again. The zoo is very well equipped, clean, the animals look healthy and the food quality and price is reasonable. On the flip side, do not expect extremely rare animals. All the",
          "the 2nd to visit in Germany , and finally we found elephants , It is very nice place not huge but a good place to spend your day .The atmosphere of the adventure and the travel from place to place is a very nice idea.",
          "So many varieties of species and i was fortunate to have good weather on the same day. Never seen Lion and zebras in the same enclosure as they kept here. It\u2019s good one time experience to visit (of course quite costly)",
          "There is no denying that a lot of money, time and effort has gone in to this zoo and it is beautifully thought out and executed. The best example of this is yukon bay! This place is spectacular and i highly recommend buying the documentary dvd which explains how it was built!",
          "I visited the zoo with a group of friends and this was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. There is a lot to see and the animals look really well taken care of and most of them have a lot of space to roam around. The lay out and design of the zoo is also very",
          "I love coming here, loads of places for the kids to play and the animals seem happy, and bonus you can take you dog on the premises too.",
          "Really nice and interactive. It gives the impression that the most of the animals are not so much contrained. Perfect for families with kids",
          "This has by far been one of my favourite zoo's ever. It has little sections for every area of the world and they have so many different and interesting animals there :) my favourite part was by far the polar bears because they are just so cute and they always put on a little",
          "This Zoo is amazing even in winter. Kids had so much fun iceskating and sledging. Really good entertainment for the whole family.",
          "Honestly, this was one of the highlights of my many trips to europe. If you are in Germany...somehow tyou have to put on your itinerary to go to Hannover Zoo. It is so well made and so many creative ideas. it has such a great relaxed vibe and so much fun. Perfect place to see",
          "We have loved going to the Zoo since our children were 3 and 5. They play in the sand and on the amazing playground. They are safe and entertained while my friends and I have coffee. Also my husband meets us for dinner sometimes and we have quality family time. Best value",
          "Price seems high at the beginning but you get a lot to see for it. I saw many mothers with maybe 2 year old kids who even had a 1-year-pass.",
          "Just spent an amazing day at Hannover zoo. A bit like a theme park with animals instead of rides! The detail in the Sambesi & Yukon areas is first class!! There are plenty of extras to keep the children entertained if looking at animals is not enough. I wanted to have a go at",
          "A great day to spend a bank holiday. The general layout was extremely interesting but having previously been informed that the zoo had recently been updated, expectations were high. However some areas were disappointing though the children's play areas exceeded all",
          "Although not the caliber of the San Diego Zoo, this zoo surprised me in its layout, health of animals, environment and cleanliness. I generally don't have high expectations of certain european amusement attractions, such as zoos, amusement parks, aquariums, etc, as I'm",
          "We come from Australia and have been to many many Zoo's.. but we think Hannover's is one of the best in the world. We will bring many family and friend as it is a great way to spend a day exploring :-)",
          "This zoo was probably one of the most unique zoos I've ever visited. The entire zoo had different themes and in each are the buildings, uniforms, and decor of each area was setup to immerse a visitor into that environment. Like the Disney World of zoos. The animals were",
          "Erlebnis zoo is very well laid out in themed areas. There are shows and show feedings throughout the day some at half hour and others at hourly intervals. The zoo is clean and tidy and all the animals appear very well cared for. There are several restaurants and each themed area",
          "It was a great place. I enjoyed the way the zoo is organized. They have a place for the polar bears and the wolfs that is just like a north pole scenario. You can see the bears swimming, and hanging out. They have a tropical forest with gorilas, chimpanzes and other monkeys. And",
          "This is an excellent zoo laid out in 5 different themes which represent different areas of the world. You need to allow 3/4 hours minimum to do this justice",
          "The zoo is situated at the end of the tram line at the wonderfully titled Zoo terminus! The zoo itself is large yet has an enclosed friendly feel aboout it. The animals on view were wide ranging and in excellent condition. Numerous species had babies, always a good sign. The",
          "It is literally the best place I have ever visited in my entire life! I kid you not, I have never been more pleased with an attraction, ever. The setting is incredible; the attention to detail is outstanding and the Seal performance is brilliant, (despite being in German). Even",
          "I've been to several zoos across Europe and I can say the one in Hannover is one of the poorest (except one in Slovakia). The best zoo in Europe for me remains the one in Barcelona. Pros: - lots of animals - the giraffes and the lions have a good output ... you can barely",
          "The Hannover Zoo advertises itself as a adventure zoo and it almost is that. There is indeed a lot of action going on. As such I can recommend e.g. some animal feeding sessions, Dr. Zoolittle, or the seal show. There you can have a real eagle flying just an inch above your head",
          "I must admit that this is one of the best zoos in Europe. You can roam around and have a glance on inumerous animals. I have been to several zoos but this one is a special one. You must not miss it. Off course there no penguins.",
          "One of the best zoos we have ever visited - go and enjoy",
          "Good place for young and old to while away a few hours, one of the best zoos in Europe.",
          "We visited in December 2011 which was when they were doing the 'Winter Zoo' and it was a great experience. They had most of the usual animals to see (apart from a few that can't handle the cold) and also turned the central area into a winter wonderland with a large ice skating",
          "Distinct geographic areas are nicely arranged. All kind of different animals. Great 'expedition' canoe ride. And when you are tired, you can enjoy good food. Plenty of pay parking. Excellent public transportation access. ATM by the door. Only negative experience is that they",
          "We were invited here as guests and were well taken care of. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was good. We had a good long night here and the hours just flew past. Can't wait to visit again",
          "Clearly the animls here are well looked after and happy, with there lives enriched by many additions. The layout and presentation of the zoo is well thought out and the buildings/ surroundings very well selected",
          "This is a very nice zoo, even in wintertime. The different theme's are very nice. There where some animals we could not see, because they where inside. The food was not expensive and very tasty.",
          "Zoo Hannover is one of the best zoos I have visited in the last years. Recently renovated it has a beautiful area called yukon bay which looks exactly like you would walk through Canada. The animals look to feel comfortable and it looks like they would be in their natural",
          "Had a fantastic day @ Erlebenis Zoo. As i visited in January a lot of the animals had a been moved inside due to the cold temperatures and the river cruise through the zoo wasn't running but this didn't detract from the experience. Highlights include the Sloths and Orangutans",
          "Having been to many zoos around the world this one was clearly the best I have been to iin my life. And the most expensive, but fully worth the money. More than enough pparkin places to start with lots of cashier boxes so no waiting times there, the staff there pretty helpful",
          "An ever changing great places for kids and adults alike. A must do and they have cool food for the kids.",
          "From start to finish the day was amazing. All the animals unlike other zoos I have visited were all grouped together as they would be in the wild. To start with we went around the african animals, helped by the small boat trip around the animals. getting so close to the",
          "The name of the zoo, \"Erlebnis Zoo Hannover\" is quite correct. This zoo really is an experience. There are a number of themed areas ranging from the Meyers farm. depicting farm life in Lower Saxony before the war, and including a really good restaraunt with local foods, to the",
          "Nice zoo, but not fabulous. Some parts of the zoo are really outdated and we felt flat-out sorry for the primates that were trapped in a Soviet-style bunker. The newer areas are very nice and impressive though. I felt the zoo did not live up to the hype, but is definately worth",
          "My kids and I love this place! It really has a lot to offer - a boat ride to see the African animals, cool exhibits, and always unique fun things for the kids to do along the way. The bathrooms were nice - all themed according to their area. Tip - don't eat at the African",
          "This Zoo is for sure the place to be, either Winter or Summer. If you are a child, adult or grandparents, this place is something for everyone! A must do in Hanover!",
          "Young pieople will enjoy this zoo. In particular the general way the zoo is arranged makes it very convienient for older people as well as for strollers. Pick a nice day when the sun is shining and you won't be disappointed."

        "wiki": "The Eilenriede is a 640-hectare (1,600-acre) municipal forest in Hannover, Germany. It is the largest urban city forest in Germany, and also one of the largest in Europe. The Eilenriede is nearly twice the size of Central Park. The biggest German urban \"park\" in the strict sense of the word, however, is the Englischer Garten M\u00fcnchen, with \"only\" 375-hectare (930-acre). (See also List of urban parks by size)\n\n\n== Size comparison ==\nIn Germany, the Eilenriede park is part of a group of inner-city or city near forest areas, like the Rostock Heath (6000 ha), the Dresden Heath (5900 ha), the Frankfurter Stadtwald (4800 ha) or the Berliner Grunewald (3000 ha). The Eilenriede is around the same size as the Stadtwald in Duisburg (600 ha) and is twice as big as Central Park (340 ha) in New York.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe park's name Eilenriede is translated in English as alder moor, describing the park as a marsh populated with alder trees.\n\n\n== Location ==\nEilenriede encloses the south of the city from the northeast, east and southeast in form of the mirror-inverted letter C with a north-south extension of about 6 km. It reaches in the south west up to the Maschsee. The entire area is covered by an 130 kilometres (81 mi) long road network (80 km hiking, 38 km Bicycle, 11 km Riding).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe city forest offers a range of different possibilities in leisure activities, like:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Literature ==\nKemper, Edwin/ Nowak, Helmut (Hrsg.): Eilenriede-Festschrift.

        "wiki": "The Lower Saxony State Museum (German: Nieders\u00e4chsisches Landesmuseum Hannover) is a museum in Hanover, Germany. It is located opposite the New City Hall. The museum comprises the State Gallery (Landesgalerie), featuring paintings and sculptures from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, plus departments of archaeology, natural history and ethnology.  The museum includes a vivarium with fish, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum's forerunner was the Museum of Art and Science (Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Wissenschaft), inaugurated in 1856 in the presence of George V of Hanover.  Based in the present-day Hanover K\u00fcnstlerhaus, it was later renamed the Museum of the Province of Hanover or Provincial Museum.  The museum soon ran out of space for its art collections, prompting the construction of the current building, on the edge of the Maschpark, in 1902.  It was designed by Hubert Stier in a Neo-Renaissance style.  The building's relief frieze, titled \"Key Moments in the Evolution of Humanity\" (Hauptmomente in der Entwicklung der Menschheit), was created by the Hanoverian artist Georg Herting in partnership with Karl Gundelach and Georg K\u00fcsthardt.\nIt was renamed the State Museum in 1933, and finally the Lower Saxony State Museum of Hanover in 1950.\nThe cupola above the central risalit was destroyed by Allied bombs during the war.  Extensive renovations and modernisations were carried out in the building's interior from 1995 to 2000.  The reopening took place on 13 May as part of Expo 2000.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== State Gallery ===\nThe State Gallery features art from the 11th to the 20th centuries.  The collection includes German and Italian works from the Renaissance and the Baroque, 17th-century Flemish and Dutch paintings, Danish paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g. Constantin Hansen), and a print room featuring old German masters, Dutch drawings, 19th-century printworks, and drawings by German Impressionists.  Some of the best-known artists include Rembrandt, Rubens and Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\nThe gallery's other strengths include German and French Impressionist paintings, works by Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth and Max Slevogt, and major works from members of the K\u00fcnstlerkolonie Worpswede group, such as Bernhard Hoetger, Fritz Overbeck, Otto Modersohn and Paula Modersohn-Becker.  Caspar David Friedrich's four-piece Tageszeitenzyklus (The Times of Day) is the only complete such series by Friedrich in a single museum.\n'Der Tageszeitenzyklus' by Caspar David Friedrich\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Natural history ===\nThe natural history department features, among other things, a life-sized model of a dinosaur, and a vivarium with more than 2,000 native and exotic fish, amphibians and reptiles.  The model dinosaur, an iguanodon, is not an accurate reconstruction by the standards of modern palaeontology, but has been integrated into an exhibition which shows the changing reconstructions of this species over time.  The department also has zoological, botanical, anthropological, geographical and geological exhibits on the primeval history of Lower Saxony's regions, including the Harz mountains, the heathlands, and the North Sea coast.\n\n\n=== Archaeology ===\n\nThe Lower Saxony State Museum has a major archaeological collection, containing some unique finds.  With over a million artifacts showing the economic and technological development of human settlement, the display covers almost 500,000 years of history, spanning the Early Stone Age to the late Middle Ages, from the early hunter-gatherer cultures to the blossoming of metropolitan life.  The archaeology department is supported by the Lower Saxony State Society of Prehistory (Nieders\u00e4chsischer Landesverein f\u00fcr Urgeschichte), and its working group \"Arbeitskreis... STEINZEIT\".\n\n\n=== Ethnology ===\nThe ethnological collection is among the oldest in German-speaking territory, and includes around 20,000 artworks and everyday artefacts from all parts of the world.  A wide range of religions and cultures in America, Africa, Oceania and Asia is displayed through the findings of explorers and ethnologists.\n\n\n== Special exhibitions and facilities ==\nThe Lower Saxony State Museum regularly hosts temporary exhibitions on changing themes.  The museum also offers its own pest control facility (a nitrogen chamber) for infested artworks and artefacts, for use by private citizens.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHeide Grape-Albers (editor): Das Nieders\u00e4chsische Landesmuseum Hannover 2002. 150 Jahre Museum in Hannover \u2013 100 Jahre Geb\u00e4ude am Maschpark.

Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen.

        "wiki": "The Sprengel Museum in Hanover houses one of the most significant collections of modern art in Germany. It is located in a building designed by Peter and Ursula Trint (of Cologne) and Dieter Quast (of Heidelberg), adjacent to the Maschsee. The museum opened in 1979 and the building was extended in 1992.\nBernhard Sprengel donated his extensive collection of modern art to the city of Hanover in 1969, as well as financially supporting the construction of the museum.  The city of Hanover and the state of Lower Saxony agreed to jointly operate the museum. In addition to the works donated by Sprengel, the museum also houses 20th century artworks owned by Lower Saxony and Hanover.\n\n\n== Expansion ==\nA further expansion, designed by Zurich-based architects Meili + Peter, was originally planned for 2010 but is now expected to begin around 2012.  The cuboid design of the new building was chosen from 65 entrants in an international architecture competition.  The original plan would have created an extra 4,350 square metres (46,800 sq ft) of exhibition space, and was expected to cost around \u20ac25m, with \u20ac10m coming from Lower Saxony's EU funding, \u20ac5m directly from Lower Saxony, \u20ac5m from the city of Hanover, and \u20ac5m expected from donors.  These estimates have since been reduced. A major objective of the expansion is to allow extensive coverage of Niki de Saint Phalle and the Hanoverian artist Kurt Schwitters.  The new building will also be used for one-off international exhibitions.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nBesides Schwitters and de Saint Phalle, the Sprengel Museums's key works include those of Max Ernst, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso, Emil Nolde, and Max Beckmann from before 1945.\nIn 1988, the museum inherited the estate of the artists and married couple Robert Michel and Ella Bergmann-Michel.  The museum publishes a printed inventory of this estate, of which two volumes have so far been published.  Since 1993, the Sprengel Museum has contained the Kurt Schwitters Archive, of which the Merz Room is particularly notable.  In 2000, Niki de Saint Phalle became an honorary citizen of Hanover and subsequently donated 300 of her works to the museum.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKurt and Ernst Schwitters Foundation",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "A caricature is a rendered image showing the features of its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way through sketching, pencil strokes, or through other artistic drawings.\nIn literature, a caricature is a description of a person using exaggeration of some characteristics and oversimplification of others.Caricatures can be insulting or complimentary and can serve a political purpose or be drawn solely for entertainment.  Caricatures of politicians are commonly used in editorial cartoons, while caricatures of movie stars are often found in entertainment magazines.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term is derived for the Italian caricare\u2014to charge or load. An early definition occurs in the English doctor Thomas Browne's Christian Morals, published posthumously in 1716.\n\nExpose not thy self by four-footed manners unto monstrous draughts, and Caricatura representations.\nwith the footnote:\n\nWhen Men's faces are drawn with resemblance to some other Animals, the Italians call it, to be drawn in Caricatura\nThus, the word \"caricature\" essentially means a \"loaded portrait\". Until the mid 19th century, it was commonly and mistakenly believed that the term shared the same root as the French 'charcuterie', likely owing to Parisian street artists using cured meats in their satirical portrayal of public figures.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSome of the earliest caricatures are found in the works of Leonardo da Vinci, who actively sought people with deformities to use as models. The point was to offer an impression of the original which was more striking than a portrait.\nCaricature took a road to its first successes in the closed aristocratic circles of France and Italy, where such portraits could be passed about for mutual enjoyment.\n\nWhile the first book on caricature drawing to be published in England was Mary Darly's A Book of Caricaturas (c. 1762), the first known North American caricatures were drawn in 1759 during the battle for Quebec.  These caricatures were the work of Brig.-Gen. George Townshend whose caricatures of British General James Wolfe, depicted as \"Deformed and crass and hideous\" (Snell), were drawn to amuse fellow officers. Elsewhere, two great practitioners of the art of caricature in 18th-century Britain were Thomas Rowlandson (1756\u20131827) and James Gillray (1757\u20131815). Rowlandson was more of an artist and his work took its inspiration mostly from the public at large.  Gillray was more concerned with the vicious visual satirisation of political life.  They were, however, great friends and caroused together in the pubs of London.In a lecture titled The History and Art of Caricature, the British caricaturist Ted Harrison said that the caricaturist can choose to either mock or wound the subject with an effective caricature. Drawing caricatures can simply be a form of entertainment and amusement \u2013 in which case gentle mockery is in order \u2013 or the art can be employed to make a serious social or political point.  A caricaturist draws on (1) the natural characteristics of the subject (the big ears, long nose, etc.); (2) the acquired characteristics (stoop, scars, facial lines etc.); and (3) the vanities (choice of hair style, spectacles, clothes, expressions, and mannerisms).\n\n\n== Notable caricaturists ==\n\nSir Max Beerbohm (1872\u20131956, British), created and published caricatures of the famous men of his own time and earlier.  His style of single-figure caricatures in formalized groupings was established by 1896 and flourished until about 1930.  His published works include Caricatures of Twenty-five Gentlemen (1896), The Poets' Corner (1904), and Rossetti and His Circle (1922).  He published widely in fashionable magazines of the time, and his works were exhibited regularly in London at the Carfax Gallery (1901\u201318) and Leicester Galleries (1911\u201357).\nGeorge Cruikshank (1792\u20131878, British) created political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians. He went on to create social caricatures of British life for popular publications such as The Comic Almanack (1835\u20131853) and Omnibus (1842). Cruikshanks' New Union Club of 1819 is notable in the context of slavery. He also earned fame as a book illustrator for Charles Dickens and many other authors.\nHonor\u00e9 Daumier (1808\u20131879, French) created over 4,000 lithographs, most of them caricatures on political, social, and everyday themes.  They were published in the daily French newspapers (Le Charivari, La Caricature etc.)\nMort Drucker (1929-2020, American) joined Mad in 1957 and became well known for his parodies of movie satires. He combined a comic strip style with caricature likenesses of film actors for Mad, and he also contributed covers to Time. He has been recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society Special Features Award for 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988, and their Reuben Award for 1987.\nAlex Gard (1900\u20131948, Russian) created more than 700 caricatures of show business celebrities and other notables for the walls of Sardi's Restaurant in the theater district of New York City: the first artist to do so.  Today the images are part of the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.\nAl Hirschfeld (1903\u20132003, American) was best known for his simple black and white renditions of celebrities and Broadway stars which used flowing contour lines over heavy rendering.  He was also known for depicting a variety of other famous people, from politicians, musicians, singers and even television stars like the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  He was even commissioned by the United States Postal Service to provide art for U.S. stamps.  Permanent collections of Hirschfeld's work appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and he boasts a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\nSebastian Kr\u00fcger (1963, German) is known for his grotesque, yet hyper-realistic distortions of the facial features of celebrities, which he renders primarily in acrylic paint, and for which he has won praise from The Times.  He is well known for his lifelike depictions of The Rolling Stones, in particular, Keith Richards.  Kr\u00fcger has published three collections of his works, and has a yearly art calendar from Morpheus International.  Kr\u00fcger's art can be seen frequently in Playboy magazine and has also been featured in the likes of Stern, L\u2019Espresso, Penthouse, and Der Spiegel and USA Today.  He has recently been working on select motion picture projects.\nDavid Levine (1926\u20132009, American) is noted for his caricatures in The New York Review of Books and Playboy magazine.  His first cartoons appeared in 1963.  Since then he has drawn hundreds of pen-and-ink caricatures of famous writers and politicians for the newspaper.\nSam Viviano (1953, American) has done much work for corporations and in advertising, having contributed to Rolling Stone, Family Weekly, Reader's Digest, Consumer Reports, and Mad, of which he is currently the art director.  Viviano's caricatures are known for their wide jaws, which Viviano has explained is a result of his incorporation of side views as well as front views into his distortions of the human face.  He has also developed a reputation for his ability to do crowd scenes.  Explaining his twice-yearly covers for Institutional Investor magazine, Viviano has said that his upper limit is sixty caricatures in nine days.\n\n\n== Computerization ==\n\nThere have been some efforts to produce caricatures automatically or semi-automatically using computer graphics techniques. For example, a system proposed by Akleman et al. provides warping tools specifically designed toward rapidly producing caricatures.  There are very few software programs designed specifically for automatically creating caricatures.\nComputer graphic system requires quite different skill sets to design a caricature as compared to the caricatures created on paper.  Thus using a computer in the digital production of caricatures requires advanced knowledge of the program's functionality.  Rather than being a simpler method of caricature creation, it can be a more complex method of creating images that feature finer coloring textures than can be created using more traditional methods.\nA milestone in formally defining caricature was Susan Brennan's master's thesis in 1982.  In her system, caricature was formalized as the process of exaggerating differences from an average face.  For example, if Prince Charles has more prominent ears than the average person, in his caricature the ears will be much larger than normal.  Brennan's system implemented this idea in a partially automated fashion as follows:  the operator was required to input a frontal drawing of the desired person having a standardized topology (the number and ordering of lines for every face).  She obtained a corresponding drawing of an average male face.  Then, the particular face was caricatured simply by subtracting from the particular face the corresponding point on the mean face (the origin being placed in the middle of the face), scaling this difference by a factor larger than one, and adding the scaled difference back onto the mean face.\nThough Brennan's formalization was introduced in the 1980s, it remains relevant in recent work.  Mo et al. refined the idea by noting that the population variance of the feature should be taken into account.  For example, the distance between the eyes varies less than other features such as the size of the nose.  Thus even a small variation in the eye spacing is unusual and should be exaggerated, whereas a correspondingly small change in the nose size relative to the mean would not be unusual enough to be worthy of exaggeration.\nOn the other hand, Liang et al. argue that caricature varies depending on the artist and cannot be captured in a single definition.  Their system uses machine learning techniques to automatically learn and mimic the style of a particular caricature artist, given training data in the form of a number of face photographs and the corresponding caricatures by that artist.  The results produced by computer graphic systems are arguably not yet of the same quality as those produced by human artists.  For example, most systems are restricted to exactly frontal poses, whereas many or even most manually produced caricatures (and face portraits in general) choose an off-center \"three-quarters\" view.  Brennan's caricature drawings were frontal-pose line drawings.  More recent systems can produce caricatures in a variety of styles, including direct geometric distortion of photographs.\n\n\n== Caricature advantage ==\nBrennan's caricature generator was used to test recognition of caricatures. Rhodes, Brennan and Carey demonstrated that caricatures were recognised more accurately than the original images. They used line drawn images but Benson and Perrett showed similar effects with photographic quality images. Explanations for this advantage have been based on both norm-based theories of face recognition and exemplar-based theories of face recognition.\n\n\n== Modern use ==\n\nBeside the political and public-figure satire, most contemporary caricatures are used as gifts or souvenirs, often drawn by street vendors.  For a small fee, a caricature can be drawn specifically (and quickly) for a patron.  These are popular at street fairs, carnivals, and even weddings, often with humorous results.Caricature artists are also popular attractions at many places frequented by tourists, especially oceanfront boardwalks, where vacationers can have a humorous caricature sketched in a few minutes for a small fee.  Caricature artists can sometimes be hired for parties, where they will draw caricatures of the guests for their entertainment.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThere are numerous museums dedicated to caricature throughout the world, including the Museo de la Caricatura of Mexico City, the Muzeum Karykatury in Warsaw,  the Caricatura Museum Frankfurt, the Wilhelm Busch Museum in Hanover and the Cartoonmuseum in Basel. The first museum of caricature in the Arab world was opened in March, 2009, at Fayoum, Egypt.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of caricaturists\nCartoon\nControversial newspaper caricatures\nJyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy\nPersona\nPhysiognomy\nSatire\nZoomorphism\nArab Cartoon Award\nMeme\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternational Society of Caricature Artists (ISCA) Official site of the International Society of Caricature Artists \u2013 a non-profit association devoted to the art of caricature (Formerly the National Caricaturist Network (NCN))\nDaumier Drawings, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which focuses on this great caricaturist\nAl Hirschfeld, an American caricaturist\nSpielmann, Marion Harry Alexander (1911). \"Caricature\" .

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen. Its Great Garden is an important European baroque garden. The palace itself was largely destroyed by Allied bombing but has been reconstructed and reopened in 2013. Among the points of interest is the Grotto. Its interior was designed by the French artist Niki de Saint Phalle). The Great Garden consists of several parts and contains Europe's highest garden fountain. The historic Garden Theatre hosted the musicals of the German rock musician Heinz Rudolf Kunze.Also at Herrenhausen, the Berggarten is a botanical garden with the most varied collection of orchids in Europe. Some points of interest are the Tropical House, the Cactus House, the Canary House and the Orchid House, and free-flying birds and butterflies. Near the entrance to the Berggarten is the historic Library Pavillon. The Mausoleum of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. Like the Great Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the Paradies and the Prairie Garden. The Georgengarten is an English landscape garden. The Leibniz Temple and the Georgen Palace are two points of interest there.\nThe landmark of Hanover is the New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus). Inside the building are four scale models of the city. A worldwide unique diagonal/arch elevator goes up the large dome at a 17 degree angle to an observation deck.The Hanover Zoo received the Park Scout Award for the fourth year running in 2009/10, placing it among the best zoos in Germany.

          "the zoo s easy ti reach in the tram and has a good variety of animals. The animals appear to be well cared for and the large enclosures look well maintained. We visited on a wet sunday and understandably a number of the animals were taking shelter. The highlight for me were the",
          "We decided to visit the zoo in Hannover as it was Sunday and most things were closed and it was a sunny winter's day. It was a nice zoo with a polar bear. I'm not really into these small zoos as the animals don't really have much room. Was disappointed that the giraffes had",
          "We had seen a couple of other zoo but this was was really nice ! I liked the suricatos and polar bear specially but all places we nice, clean and organized! It worths the visit !",
          "Nice place to visit with kids as they will really enjoy seeing all the animals which they have seen on screen. They have amazing collection of many rare animals. It's better to start early so that u have enough time to check everything, it's quite big so u have to walk a lot",
          "This beautiful zoo had so much to see and do. Our toddler had lots of things to see and didn\u2019t mind missing a nap to see a lot of it. The short boat ride is worth it if the line isn\u2019t too long. Excellent day in Hannover!",
          "This is a great place and the animals really look well taken cared of. Used up much memory and battery of the camera because there\u2019s so much beauty here.",
          "One of the best zoo experiences. Lovely place, interesting sight. Something new every visit. An exciting boat ride where you can see African animals",
          "Nice place, you need one day to fully take advantage of this place. There are zones, which represent different continents. The Landscape and building work is amazing you really feel like you're visiting different places in the world. The animals don't seem unhappy (one or two",
          "Lovely day out. Lots of enclosures being up dated . Walk through areas which children and adults enjoy eg pelicans , wallaby, under ground to see penguins, seals, polar bears. Food reasonably priced and toilet facilities clean. Worth a visit.",
          "some animals you just assume you will never actually see in life except for on the tv or internet. this was a day to remember!",
          "Never seen a zoo like this one. Rather expensive to get in and they don\u2019t offer a discount for seniors which is a shame. It was very well laid out and easy to get round. Lots of animals to see and they all looked well looked after. Lovely restaurant on site as well. A lovely day",
          "There is a route to follow then you will see everything, lions, giraffes, polarbears etc. There are different themes eg. India, where you see animals typical of India. Entrance fee is a bit expensive.",
          "Nice zoo to visit. Different theme areas. Try to check the timetable of shows. I really loved the show of seals...",
          "This zoo is absolutely fantastic! A great day out for adults and children a like! It has different continents themed with animals! My favourite was Yukon bay with the penguins and seals! There\u2019s a fantastic boat ride you can do as well! This is my 2nd favourite zoo after the one",
          "splendid garden. Is a palace of nature. Whicha large number of species, which natural frames for all the animals. The elehant is near an indian temple. The asiatic monkeys hang on the wals of an indian temple..just like in The Book of Jungle. Yukon bay is amazing, with old",
          "We spend the whole Sunday visiting the zoo. The price was a bit steep (26 EUR) but it is worth it. The main attraction is the Polar bear who during our visit decided to come out for a stroll and a swim. We also managed to capture a video of him swimming from the viewing area.",
          "We enjoyed a nice visit with some extended family including three young boys who thourghly enjoyed themselves. The boat ride was the biggest hit.",

          "not a lot of signs in this zoo, and it is very easy to get lost.great place to visit but in Winter I was not able to see all the animals, and there are a lot constructions in this zoo in Jan 2019",
          "I spent a day at that zoo with the kids. It was very nice. I expected it to be bigger but it was fine. We took nice photos as the zoo is designed in different countries themes. There was also a very nice christmas market there. Food there was ok.",
          "Visits the zoo on a Sunday, we where very impressed by the attention to detail and how the exhibits hide the zoo and you feel one with the animals. Can\u2019t say it loud enough, a must visit in Hannover",

          "Just superb. I have visited so msny zoo in many countries. But this is something thst must not be missef. We saw so many new types of birds. And almost alllll the animals. We saw Evem wild wolves that were spookily singing/screaming with their untuned noise.. it was giving the",

          "It\u2019s a nice experience, well managed and carefully organized, also seeing when the animals are fed. A bit sad seeing lions at 0 degrees. Nice also the services and food variety inside",
          "While visiting Hannover you should check out the Zoo! It might be expensive, but it\u2019s huge and beautifully made. You won\u2019t be disappointed and can spent there a whole day without getting bored. Perfect for groups and families!",
          "This zoo is fantastic. We loved to see the animals and how close you can come. The little boat ride is fun too. We really enjoyed the visit. Most animals are held in bigger areas which are fenced off through more natural barriers like water or big stones. The different themes",

          "The Hannover Zoo is one of the best zoo\u2019s in Germany. It is an outstanding zoo because of its experienced oriented caracter. It feels at least a bit like in the wild, a lot of space and a great atmosphere. There are a lot of nice details that make this zoo so special. Especilly",
          "Hannover zoo is very well organised, all animals seem well cared for and there are always many babies. It is different than any other zoo I have visited before! Animals are never in cages and open spaces with natural barriers are common. Food is varied and good. Very busy on",

          "I went here with my wife and was shocked to see these poor elephants. You could see how sad they were in their eyes. I would not recommend this zoo to anyone. Very poorly run.",

          "The zoo is absolutely fantastic! Great to do with family or friends. The layout of the zoo is amazing, it has different compartments based on the animals and the countries they are from.",
          "After visiting Hannover for the Agritechnica Exhibition we filled in Sunday, before flying back to the UK, by visiting the Zoo which is about 15 mins from the City centre. Interestingly the tube train, which doubles as a tram because it is overground when you get off, leaves you",
          "At the entrance they said we\u2019d only have an hour. OK. What they didn\u2019t say was that most exhibits were closed. We can cover some ground in an hour, but not when it\u2019s gated, chained and fenced off. We saw goats, pigs, cows and giraffes in small cages ... and a few monkeys. They",
          "It was better than I expected, the animals where in mini parks whichever were kind of aligned to their natural habitat. Some were alone though , which made my niece unhappy, as all animals should have friends in her view, which may not be probably possible. She liked the",
          "on Saturday the price for adult was 25EUR it was a nice and organized zoo, variety in the animals but was OK it didn't offer more than a regular zoo.",
          "It's not the biggest zoo and it hasn't the biggest variety of animals.( Berlin zoo has it)This is a zoo that's been thoughtfully taken care of - each area has its own theme. Also there's a small (free) boat ride! If you are in Hannover with children, this is the no 1 place",
          "I am disgusted in how you treat your Elephants. God knows what else you do to the other poor animals. Abusing/forcing them to do tricks for your own selfish reasons so you can bring in money. Shameful! What gives us a right as humans to treat animals like that?!",
          "There is building work at the entrance right now but does not cause problems. There is a relaxed feel to the zoo. Many kind staff. Many happy children enjoying the zoo today. The free boat ride was a real treat. Worth having a go. It is ok to go round as many times as you",
          "This is a zoo that's been thoughtfully taken care of - each area has its own theme, and there's even a small (free) boat ride! I won't say that it has the most variety of animals, but it's really worth a visit. Easily spent 3 hours there without knowing it. Oh, and you may",
          "We visited the zoo with friends and while we thought it a tad expensive at 25\u20ac each we enjoyed our visit. The highlight was visiting Henry the Polar bear. He enclosure is fantastic he has plenty of space and and a deep pool with wave action. It's one of the best exhibits we",
          "Zoo has a huge and nice area with a great variety of animals (I miss birds). All environments look like movie sets. Sometimes, having so many furnitures and scenery makes harder to see the animals due to small space to accomodate everybody who is visiting the zoo. There is a",
          "We visited the zoo on a busy holiday Monday in June. The zoo had obviously spent what must have been a considerable amount of money, time and effort to create well thought through, suitable habitats for the animals. Food outlets and entertainment for the children were very good.",
          "My wife and I visited the zoo in Hannover while we were here for a long weekend. We used our Hannover card to travel there, and then got a \u20ac3 discount per entry ticket. I've been to a number of zoos in my life and this one is right up there with the best. The range of animals",
          "This wasn't the cheapest day out by any measure but this was one of those defining points in my wife and children's lives that they WILL not forget. The zoo itself is undergoing some improvement work and thus from the outside it doesn't look the best. I would also say that",
          "I've heard bunch of very postiv opinions about the zoo among locals. I decided to visit it with friends in February. I did not have the experience I expected. The animal seemd unhappy and bored. This may be due to the winter period, lets see if I will try this again.",
          "I couldn't believe what an amazing zoo Hannover had to offer! First, we went on a boat ride through the Africa section of the zoo. A must do. Takes only 12 minutes and you go by the zebras, giraffes, and more. We saw lions, leopards, and so many elephants with their babies!!",
          "We visited the zoo with the intention of seeing my wife's favourite, the wallabies but when we got there they were probably taking an afternoon nap! However the other animals and the settings more than made up for the disappointment.",
          "I was expecting to see a huge area filled with many animals. Even though there are many different species, it wasn't exactly what I was waiting. If you visit it, make sure you attent the seals performance.",
          "The zoo is really amazing! I liked that for each section there is a different theme, it was awesome. Also we managed to catch quite a number of shows, no wonder we spent almost half of the day there. :)",
          "This is the best zoo I've ever been to. It's had lots of investment over the last decade or so and the themed areas are very special and make you feel like you're on a trip abroad - the African area with the Sambesi boat ride, the Yukon Bay Area which houses wolves, polar bears,",
          "Visited in Feb but would like to go again but in summer as you get to see more and do more. It was still a nice day to go and explore the zoo. It took about two hours to see everything although you could spend much longer. Definitely recommended if you are going to Hannover",
          "The animals are so unhappy. It's sad to see them like this. It was the the first time at the zoo for me and definitely the last one.",
          "We go to loads of Zoos. We didn't really plan on Hannover Zoo, we thought we would go to a different one that we had researched, but this was closer. You can get the metro out to the zoo, which is a quick and pleasant journey. The zoo is quite spread out, so there is much",
          "I visited the Zoo for the first time after four years living in hannover and I wish I did it before. It is a nice place. I have only gone in summer time and you could see all the animals. The polar bear is amazing to watch sumerge in the water. I was told by friends that went in",
          "We visited the zoo as a family, three children and two adults. The entrance fee was very reasonable. There is a vast range of animals to see and the enclosures are constructed in such a way that you get great views. For example the Hippo enclosure is glass fronted so you get to",
          "This zoo is really fun! Make sure you make it in time for all their shows! They are sure cool and fun! (They are all in German but you can still have a fun time if you don't know German) Their animals seem to be having a better life than other zoos I've been to!",
          "This isn't the place to visit during winter months, as we found out. The price is still 19.50Euro each, which is rather steep, considering how little there is to see and do. It would have been nice to be told that most parts are closed or being renovated. We visited last year",
          "I enjoy this zoo,every time i come and visit. The africa part is what i like most about it. Cool animals",
          "Visited the Zoo on 30 November which is Winter season. Opening hours are 10am - 4pm. The entry still costs \u20ac19.50 pp which is expensive considering many of the attractions and enclosures are closed or being renovated. Very few people visiting but it was very cold - even the",
          "My partner and I had a day to kill in Hannover - so we decided to visit the zoo. I wasn't really expecting much but it was probably the best zoo I have ever been to. Personal highlight was the boat ride, which takes you around part of the zoo. A really lovely way to spend an",
          "Unfortunately we only got to see the polar bear being fed, because we went there late, nevertheless it was an amazing experience, the zoo stood out because it reminded me of an old western movie place, saloon like, and the lights outside was very pretty.\\ The restaurant was",
          "I'm not a fan of zoos always but I know they do a lot of good work with conservation. We enjoyed the trip around the little waterway but on the whole I felt the gorilla looked really sad and bored and barged up to window and shoulder barged it and also the polar bear enclosure",
          "One of the best Zoos you can find in Germany. The Zoo is going a longterm transformation from a former visitor centric Zoo with bad condutions for the animals to a entertaining Zoo where animals are treated with equivalent rights. The animals live in thematic enclosures, have",
          "The zoo offers a great variety of animals and puts a great deal of effort (and investment) into creating attractive environments (Yukon, Africa, India, etc.). They also have a very nice restaurant and beer garden, Meyer's Hof, that you can sometimes get to without paying the",

          "Visited alone when on aholiday from australia. Great zoo worth a visit even for an adult, enclosures are really well made and lots of different animals compared to other zoos i have seen! Worth watching the polar bear feeding if you are there at that time, it is in german but",
          "If you are looking for something to do in Hannover with or without kids/babies, zoo is the best choice.",
          "We found this zoo perfect and complete. Beautiful places and locations had been designed very good according to genre, type of each animals. I suggest to each people who has interests on nature and wild life, to spend enough time more than 6 hours to can get a complete tour in",
          "It was very cold when we went but the zoo was really quiet because of this and the fact it was a school day in Germany There were a lot of different animals and you could get a good view of them all.The kids really enjoyed it and the food in the cafe was reasonable. There were",
          "We went to this zoo with my 6yr old grandson. I don't agree with zoo's generally, but he wanted to see a polar bear. A good day out it has to be said but a zoo is a zoo, and a cage no matter how well its kitted out, still remains a cage. We arrived about 11am and stayed all day",
          "We have small kids and visit the zoo about once every 1-2 years. This was our 4th and last visit. It is an absolutely over priced activity (\u20ac87 for a family of 4). There are 3 major things wrong with this place: 1. People are allowed to smoke and they do it everywhere. 2. The",
          "really good zoo.loved the different themed areas.zambezi river,yukon area(including polar bears),india and then Australia.it was well thought out and easy to get around.didnt get lost and spent all day there",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by Erlebnis Zoo even though some of the animals, such as the Giraffes and Zebras weren't present do to problems with their terrain. We have visited the zoo in Hamburg for the last couple of years, where theirs is a really pretty well kept zoo,",
          "A very enjoyable visit to the adventure Zoo in Hannover. Great attractions - India themed elephant enclosure, Alaskan themed polar station as well as a great play ground with adventure castle and massive sand pit! All this is rounded up in the end with a beautiful Farmers range",
          "We have been to a lot of different zoos, but this one is overall the best one we have been to so far! This was our second time here. t has a lot of great attraction for the kids (ours are 3,5,7 years old), and you get really close to the animals. We love it!",
          "We saw a make believe African School and a village. We learnt that there are 3 types of zebras. There were lions, zebras, penguins, even leopards and elephants. You could touch ivory. I would recommend this to everyone. Yukon Bay had a lone wolf - quite literally. We also",
          "So we go to a lot of zoos - in all sorts of places. And this one was really very nice. Not huge but lovely layout and decent selection of animals. The Yukon bit and the Indian sections are both really impressive and wouldn't look out of place in a world class theme park. And -",
          "I have been to a lots of zoos and I have to say that this zoo is up there with the best. I loved the fact that I could take photos of so many of the animals without having to take the shot through glass. The different themed areas work really well and I loved the Zambezi boat",
          "Spent the whole day around this fantastic, massive,well maintained zoo. I've been to the zoo in munster and this one dwarfs it. Animals seem to be well cared for and the whole place is so clean. All staff seem to be educated in the paticular animals they care for and friendly",
          "Visited the Zoo in early December to enjoy the Christmas Market, which was excellent, and much better than the other Christmas Markets scattered around Hannover town centre! Although small, the atmosphere around the various bars and stalls that were situated around the ice rink",
          "The Zoo is well-designed: classified animals according to continents : Africa, India, Canada....even toilets are built according to their districts. Interesting. The Zoo is not that big, half day is enough for young people or it is nice for family with kids to spend a day.",
          "Spent a wonderful afternoon here. Easy to get to, drive or just take the subway which stops right by the front entrance. Very easy to walk about everywhere and well designed layout. Has the whole range of animals from polar bears to gorillas, to tigers, to elephants, you name",
          "I love zoos. Have been to zoos all over North America and Europe. This is one of the very best and it isn't really given much notice in the guide books and reviews. Truly wonderful! Animals are depicted in more natural habitats often in with compatible animals. The animals",
          "The zoo in Hannover is devided into several so called \"worlds\" each with a theme/continent where you will find the animals living there. Most of the parts have been renovated since 2000 and they are still renovating to make it even better. I especially love the part called",
          "Set out with themed attractions such as the Yukon - a mine plus rocky water with merchant ship built in to it and with wave machine. showed off well the polar bear (saw only one who seemed happy enough) unlike Rhino (also only saw one) that exhibited some repetitive walking",
          "has all kinds of animals: Moneky house, zebras, giraffe, rhinos (difficult to spot), elephants, tiger, leopard, hippo, many birds. Excellent playing ground for children (jumping nets, climbing castle, etc.)",
          "The zoo is well kept and animals are not kept in cages but in enclosed spaces with a scenery mimicking their normal environment. We attended the shows which were interesting although we could not understand much given that everything was in German. The only annoying thing was",
          "This is a well- planned and set Zoo that offers a lot of interesting animals and activities for children in a nice setting. Like every Zoo in Germany , the topically arranged gastronomy is very expensive and no one can dodge the small snackbars; ICE AND TOFFEE STANDS with three",
          "I absolutely love the Hannover Zoo. It is more \"real\" than most other ones that I have visited over the years. There are several varieties of animals to see and they are not enclosed in small areas like other zoos that I have seen. I went to this zoo 4 times when I lived in",
          "A zoo visit is a must on any trip! This place is much better than others in Germany (like Bremerhaven) with a decent range of well looked after animals. The underwater world is nice, and the sea lions have a huge pool and wave machine - they really did look like they were having",
          "For anyone who likes zoos this is a must on your calendar when visiting Hanover. The zoo is beautifully laid out lots of sights and events for all ages. The large selection of animals and their surroundings are very interesting and cater for all interests, especially those of",

          "This zoo is a must do in the city. Easy to arrive is a great plan with family or firends. The animals are beautiful and well care. It is a place to learn and know different species due to their great areas and information. The elephant\u00b4s area is amazing and also the tour by",
          "I spent 5 hours in the ZOO with my little sons and my mom. Everything is perfectly organized, animals have plenty of space and seem to be really well cared. I can imagine spending the whole day there, each part of the ZOO has a different topic that fully catches your attention,",
          "We went the last days of the winter season and it surprised us the wellness of most of the animals. In general they had big places to live in. A zoo designed for kids. Since the entrance doors this zoo is designed to allow the kids have a natural and a great experience.",
          "It's a must if you like animals and nature! Very well organized and the animals living in unter very good conditions,they care about them. The only \"bad\" thing, It says that it close at 18.00 but when we are visit at November, they start from 16.30 to close the animals in",
          "The Zoo is one of the best i have been to - including san diege - Leipzig & Hamburg - nearly none of the small cages from the early times of the \"Zoo Business\" is left over",
          "An extremely good zoo with lots of animals on show. The emphasis is on natural surroundings for the animals with best possible viewing. Feeding times and shows are well publicized and frequented. On the whole well worth a repeat visit several times a year. The winter zoo is a",
          "Not a very big but very accurate and well-organized Zoo. Never seen such happy animals. To avoid stay in the line to pay parking fee - better to pay at the Zoo exit but not at 3-storey Parking.",
          "It's an adventure parc, a zoo, a great place to eat and have fun, great for those who have kids too. The entrance fee is 25\u20ac but it's worth every penny especially when u think that it' s all for the animals and for aranging those beautiful areas with different themes. The",
          "...very expensive. EUR 25,00 is the entrance fee for a adult. You get to see awesome animals and scenery, but still it's to expensive.",
          "Easily the best zoo I have ever visited. I was amazed at the way they have sectioned it into themed areas such as Africa, Canada, and Australia. It is not just a collection of animals, it is much more than that.",
          "Smallish zoo with a novel approach to showing off their animals. They have zones, like the Yukon zone for their seals, wolves and polar bears. The Indian zone was particularly well done with a family of elephants. Worth a visit.",
          "Zoo great loads of animals,places to eat quite reasonable and large,two could share. Shows and displays,nice little boat ride free included in entry price 20 euros,you can spend a full day.",
          "Spent the whole day at the zoo. Cost 25.00 to get in and I was expecting a normal zoo, I have never been so wrong, it has areas of the world that even look like where they ar supposed to be, in the first area Africa, there is a river with automatic boats that take you round and",
          "First of all its easy to get there. The zoo it self are so convenient to walk. There are no single of boring moment. The areas splits are absolutely grate. There's a lot of places to stop and eat . The fidding area is so fun for the young children. The only problem is that's the",
          "Spent the day here. Lots of different things to see and do. There is a boat that takes you around some of the exhibits. The Yukon Bay Area is great with the polar bears swimming. The American show is good but I won't spoil it by saying anymore!!",
          "It is quite an interesting place to visit. I must say, I wasn't in such an zoo and it looks really great. There are still some things to sort out, to renew or rebuild but all in all, a nice place. Only thing that remains bitter after visiting is the price. I understand that it",
          "Visited this zoo the other day and it is so good that my 4 yr old loved it. Much better then the zoo i been to in London my home town. The boat ride was wicked... I had to speed up my visit as we was driving back to england but i could of stayed there all day without my son",
          "When I was taking part in my German exchange, we decided to visit the zoo. I assumed that the animals are probably going to have a very limited amount of space, and it would most definitely much up to the London Zoo, however, I was proven wrong. The animals were treated with",
          "We visited family in Hildesheim for a week in August and on one of the days decided to visit Hannover Zoo, WOW. It's a fantastic zoo with lots to see and do, and the animals are obviously looked after very well, we were lucky enough to watch the feedings of the Polar Bear,",
          "Last December I had the opportunity to visit Hannover/Germany (I live in Las Vegas). One late afternoon my sister took me to the Hannover Winter Zoo (called Winter Zoo during that time of the year). I was questioning her mental health - who on earth wants to go in the dark at 27",
          "We really enjoyed in Hannover Zoo. Boat tour was perfect and the ticket price include it also. However, i couldn't see crocodiles. I will recommend everyone to visit this zoo when their Hannover visiting...",
          "A good sized zoo that's well laid out and with lots to see. The kids really enjoyed themselves. Already looking forward to our next visit.",
          "This zoo is well laid out, with many interesting animals. I really appreciated the many opportunities given to hear zoo keepers talk about the animals while feeding them. The sea lion show was also very good.",
          "Great experience! The animals seemed like well taken care of and they had plenty of room. Polar bear was my absolute favorite! Also the seal/eagle show was great!",
          "I was there on a solo business trip but I was just thinking how much better if I had the family with me. It's a nice well kept zoo, though I think some animals might be a bit shy or nocturnal animals - I couldn't find them in their closures. The small animal shows are pretty",
          "Not the largest zoo but very well designed and layer out. Great themed enclosures tho some could be bigger (orangatan's and big birds). There is a fun boat ride and great lay areas for the kids scattered throughout the park to keep the little ones entertained. Food areas clean,",
          "The zoo is very park-like...very nice to visit just for a walk. Animal enclosures simulate wild habitats. Interaction via feedings, etc. Downside is that the zoo is expensive for daytrippers.",
          "Hannover zoo is very nice. I visited the zoo with my friends. They have a large variety of animals and birds. It's good to go to the zoo if visiting Hannover.",
          "Very nice animal displays and a lovely park layout. Way too expensive. Only reason we went was because of a gift card we got.",
          "The exhibits were clean and well designed for the animal. Boat ride was nice. The animals were all active so they were fun to watch. All the signs are in German as were the shows. But you can get the gest of it.",
          "It is a wonderful zoo, the settings are marvellous even when not without mistake as the Siberian Tiger in the Indian setting or very short descriptions on the animals. In that, there are much better Zoos around. What, however is really impressive is the larger settings like the",
          "I travelled quite a distance to visit this zoo as I had heard it was supposed to show animals in their natural habits... If that's what you can call small areas just painted to look real. The fact that this zoo prides itself on giving the animals natural surroundings made it so",
          "Good for kids,family and small group from school. Not too large zoo park as space but it is full with kind of animal. The designer of the park is smart , he take benefit of all the space and produce a very lovely zoo. I visited it in 4 hours and I watched the shows of see life",
          "we have been planning on visiting this zoo for sometime already, we managed to visit this last weekend. the weather was okay, a bit rain shower in the morning but enough sun to keep it warm. we expected that it will be full on Sunday but its just enough crowd, no waiting queue",
          "I came with my girldfriend, because we read that it was a very nice zoo, and we hadn't been to one for a long time. The entry was 25\u20ac for adults, and in my opinion, it is expensive; otherwise the zoo is very clean and with a great variety of animals from different continents.",
          "We had looked at what to do whilst in Hannover and came across the zoo. Thought haven't been to a zoo for years so why not. We were not disappointed. The queue to get in wasn't too bad as it was still holiday time. We were given a guide in English which was good and vey helpful!",
          "I visited Hannover zoo twenty years ago and though it was special. I visited again this month (April 2015) and it blew my mind away. This is by far the best attraction I have been to in a long time. Don't be put off by the ticked price of \u20ac25. It's worth twice that. Their is",
          "We truly loved this zoo. It's quiet big, lots of different well known animals like lions, polar bears, giraffes, bisons, wolves buy also smaller animals like snakes and wombats. Highlight for us were the polar bears and the lions, lots of new borns as well!",
          "Best Zoo visited ever. We do not have kids but for us it was a complete surprise and an outstanding experience. For the first time I did not feel sorry for the animals, instead you are happy to know how much love and care is given to all of them by trying to have the most",
          "I visited with a party of school children & we were all very impressed. It has been designed exceptionally well. Thr facilities, even in February, were very good. The highlight was watching the polar bear dive into the water & swim - just incredible .",
          "We believe to know a fair bit about animal care and health. We also have 2 young animal loving children of 5 and 6 years. This is in both respects the best Zoo / animal park we have visited. It is fun for the kids, for more than one day. The animals are kept extremely well and",
          "I visited in winter which is challenging. But most of the amimals were out and about. The path layout makes sure you see everything. Summer would be the best time but it was a good use of an hour or two on a winters day. Easy to get there as the train stops right next to it.",
          "Visited with family in Dec 14. Fantastic experience. Elephant area and Yukon were highlights. Winter area was fantastic too (markets, ice skating, sledding etc.). would definitely recommend to families with young kids.",
          "yes, I know, that is quite a statement. And I am a regular visitor of Zoo's around the world. But when the world exhibition came to Hannover, they really remade this Zoo completely and it is great. They created artifical landscapes for the animals to live in. You have parts of",
          "I really like this Zoo. Good attractions, nice shows and setups. For kids it is a must. Prices are reasonable.",
          "Was a lovely zoo, great set up, variety was excellent not badly priced at all. And the trips and shows were very well run. The boats on river was brilliant",
          "I think this was one of the best ways to spend a day at Hannover! In the heart of the city (train 10) if I'm not wrong takes you to the Zoo! The animals have been kept well, fed on time, and they allow pets to visit as well!! Very clean and tidy, the maps guide you well inside",
          "The Hannover zoo is an amazing place. I was really impressed to see the animals kept in a near natural enclosure. The zoo map makes it very easy to locate the animals in a well arranged natural clusters like zanzibar, australia, india, underwater life and yukon bay. the",
          "Went to the zoo with mixed views as a zoo in a city sounds a bit strange. The price was very reasonable and so was the cost of activities/food. A really good selection of the big and small animals, all very easy to get up close to. The recreation of natural habitats was at times",
          "The Zoo is One of the Mixer Zoos i have visited, but the price is rather high. And even though they are trying to make the place ok for the animals, it still feels like it's not quite enough. But maybe that's just my opinion as I am not really a 'zoo person'. I am sure the kids",
          "The Hannover Zoo is not a classical Zoo with Animals in Cages, instead it is following the concept of an adventure Zoo. It is separated into different Continents. In Africa, you can take a tour with a boat and experience the animals in their environment. The new created Yukon",
          "I love Zoo's, and being a solo travellor (and not a very confident one!), I wanted something easy to do. The zoo was very short taxi ride from my hotel (Suite Novotel) and cost 8 euros. None of the entrance signs were in English which was a shame, so I joined a que and hoped",
          "The Berlin Zoo may be more famous, but it the Hannover Zoo is far superior. (Berlin Zoo looks like it hasn't changed in 60 years, with the traditional feeling of animals being imprisoned.) What we love about this zoo is the themed areas -- like Yukon Bay, which is brilliant.",
          "I went to several zoos in Germany but hannover zoo was the best especially with good weather that you could attend some live shows. I really recommend it however it is too expensive",
          "Just got back from visiting the Zoo it was a perfect stop over location on the way back from the in laws in Poland on the way to Europort to catch the ferry home. Arrived at opening time after a short walk from our hotel and it crossed my mind... Have I made a wise decision?",
          "One of the best zoos I've been to in this part of Europe. Very organized and easy to navigate. The highlights for us and our 7yo were: the boat ride, the Indian courtyard and the elephants, the polar bear, and the gorillas. The sea world show is nice even if the voiceover is",
          "Visited in June, was not crowded. Huge and very natural looking. Zambesi part was my favorite with the boat ride around. (Queues might be long in peak season.) Lots of exotic trees/bushes/flowers. Also the polar bear/seal/pinguin area was very natural. Feedings/shows are several",
          "this is one of the greatest places to be seen in Hannover , it is really fantastic area to see such kind of different animales , clean natural area , very good planned area for such kind of zoo , as it was between large forest and clean green area , clean oxygenated air ,",
          "The Hannover Zoo is a great place to visit when in Hannover with children but not only. Great attractions nice arrangements, all in all a fun day out for the kids and adults alike. The boat ride is very nice and the fact that you can at times get really close to the animals,",
          "Hannover Zoo is a fantastic day-trip for the whole family. The zoo itself is dedicated to keeping their animals happy and stimulated, and their main aim is to educate their visitors about the animals that they house. Each exhibit is expertly suited to the animal it contains,",
          "One of the best zoos that I have visited. The boat ride was very relaxing. Good choice on a sunny day and reasonably priced.",
          "Ok didn't go in. Should have checked prices before travelling there. 25 Euros per adult means that this zoo is for adults with lots of spare money. Not me then!",
          "It have lots of activities. The show of the penguin and also the restaurant was awesome. I will recommend that to anyone that have kids.",
          "Whoever designed this zoo deserves a medal - it's absolutely amazing. Rather than having the 'typical' zoo feel with a lot of enclosures in metal / concrete, there are different zones in the zoo and each zone has been designed amazingly well so that you really feel you are in",
          "Turning mid winter, on a shower ridden afternoon we were worried, but should not have been as town zoos go this is by far the nicest I have been to. Split into zones there was plenty to keep us occupied for 4hrs. The animals look well looked after, the surrounding are amazing",
          "The Polar Bears are great and the fact that they allow dog into the zoo makes it interesting as the big cats want to eat them. The elephants were great, attempting to move a massive balls over a log. It showed how clever they were and how persistent, not that the poor elephant",
          "We are holders of annual tickets and are regular visitors every time we are surprised by something great place to visit.",
          "On a weekend visit to Hannover decided on a trip to the zoo. I was expecting a small concrete place as you find with a lot of small urban zoos. I could not have been more wrong!!!! It was amazing. Although small, it takes less than an hour to walk round the whole place, the",
          "When travelling to visit my military boyfriend in Hannover, we had nothing to do one Sunday and as most things are closed, we decided to take a trip to the zoo. I wasn't expecting a lot. Usually inner city zoos lack charm and personality but this was something else! We went",
          "Went to the zoo on a cold November day. Was pretty kicked to catch a lot of animals up close, due to the Plexiglas viewing windows. However the polar bears were not there :( Big bummer! In-fact the whole arctic section was closed off. I as an Indian, loved the huge section",
          "The zoo is one of Hannovers main attractions. We really enjoyed the ambience and the many animals around.",
          "Amazing Zoo or better to say more like a Theme Park with the different sections which reflect different parts of the world. In Summer the river tour is great fun and in Winter the Xmas Market is a nice place to have a Gluehwein.",
          "We visited this lovely zoo on 27th November 2013. It was a cold but dry day and we fully understand the limitations of visiting a zoo in the middle of winter as many of the animals are kept indoors for obvious reasons. Our visit was during refurbishment work of the polar bears",
          "I was in the Zoo Hannover several times as couple and also with 2 children. It is always an interesting experience... especially for kids.",
          "Very beautiful area, a little expensiv. The presentation of animals is excellent. Play areas for enfants and toddlers.",
          "Don't expect to see a vast array of species, but the ones here are amazing, in fantastic surroundings. The Zoo is broken up into different zones, with features abound. For example, the elephant enclosure is superb, with lots of space for the animals and surroundings that make",
          "I didn't have much luck when it comes to weather, it was a rainy day. We decided to go to zoo anyway and it was a great decision. Entry costs 25 EUR per adult, but it was worth. Whole place is organized in a themes, so during the trip you are a traveller through Africa",
          "I visited the zoo when I lived in Hannover and wasn't impressed. It is much improved and a pleasure to visit. Love the Yukon area with the polar bears and underwater viewing.",
          "I've not been to hundreds of zoos or anything, but this is easily the best. We were thinking of going to the zoo in Berlin to see polar bears, but a local in Hannover told us that the zoo in Hannover was much better, and that it also had polar bears. I've not been to the Berlin",
          "This is by far the best zoo I have been too. There is an interesting assortment of animals from all over the world. It was a great afternoon!",
          "This is a very nice zoo, clean and easy to visit. The boat ride was fun for the kids, and you can see lions, giraffes and other animals VERY CLOSE, which is exciting. We can't help but feel sad for the chimps, whose cage was over-crowded. The other primates also seemed to need",
          "Great settings for the animals. For example, the elephants live in an old Indian temple and the polar bears live in an old abandoned Yukon whaling station. They use plexiglass to great effect at this zoo so you really can get remarkably close to the animals. Strange that they",
          "My brother and I visited this zoo on our trip to Germany recently and quiet enjoyed it, I especially liked the themed areas the zoo has, for example putting the polar region animals in the Yukon Bay Area, and the boat ride through the African experience, it's an easy zoo to",
          "I love this zoo - I have visited it 4-5 times. They have done an amazing job of the exhibits - the food is a little pricy but to be expected within a zoo.",
          "This zoo was fabulous for kids. It had about 20 separate areas. tree house, eating areas, trampolines, grasslands and parks and that is over and above the animals! There was a great boat ride through the Africa part of the zoo. We also really liked that the zoo aimed to add",
          "Interesting deco of enclosures surrounded by lovely forest. Zoo keepers well versed and knowledgeable and important to support places that look after the animals well.",
          "A zoo that is small enough not to get bored but big enough to have a good selection of animals. Animals look well cared for and appear to have adequate space. Loved the Polar bears and Meercats. I thought it was good value at 25 eoros for an adult. Did not have the food so",
          "a must see when in Hannover, can bee done in 4 hours, but I recomend to use a day if weather is good, lots of shows and great for kids.",
          "It hav, by far, the best infrastructure, the animals are in large enough spaces, and the tematic zones are briliantly prepared. Pure AWSOMNESS :)",
          "Went to this zoo a few months back for the afternoon. Easy to get too and really good value for money. We loved going into the petting zoo and picking up the goats (inner child in me) and the zoo was really easy to get around. I can imagine its a great place to take the family",
          "Well laid out, lots of shows and things to do, a good day out for all the family, although a touch expensive when compared to places like London Zoo",
          "This zoo was brilliant and is well worth a visit. We spent the whole day here and there was lots to do. The food was of a very good standard and not to expensive. The 7 different zones were well thought out and very well designed even down to the toilets. All the animals looked",
          "I suppose as zoos go, it is worthvisiting for a day out for want of anything better to do with kids in Hanover. II am not a particular fan of zoos, so my review is biased. However, kids really enjoy the water ride, Yukon, and proximity to the animals. the shop is also quite",
          "This is a wonderful Zoo with or without children so much to see and do. The boat trip is well worth the wait in the queue. The Yukon are is quite spectacular.",
          "This is probably the best zoo I have visited. It is quite expensive (25 euro each) but we spent about 6 hours here and I would say it is worth the price. It is divided into different areas (Australia, Yukon etc) and each of them has been brilliantly designed and landscaped.",
          "I have now visited this zoo 3 times. It's great, particularly the polar bear exhibit and the elephants. There are lots of places to eat which are all very reasonably priced. A great day out, well worth every penny.",
          "This zoo has loads of really exciting animals. My particular favourite were the elephants but the big cats, polar bears, monkeys, wolves seals and the Zambezi river tour. Although they did put penguins in the \"Yukon Bay\" which isn't exactly geographically correct... All the",
          "Despite the small size zoo there some great attraction such as a couple of days old baby giraffe...Really nice , the seals, and the white panthers jumping around.",
          "I have 4 kids of varying ages and seem to hit so many zoos over the years wherever we go. This is by far the best zoo ever so far. Other zoos in the area fall away under this blaze of glory. Ok so the food drink and souvenirs are expensive but that's seems quite normal for",
          "It was very nice with all the snow. There was also a sleigh-track for free for the kids. Easy to reach with one of the buses/trams. There is also a cafeteria where you can order all sorts of different fast foods, although a bit pricey, not nor more than you would pay at any",
          "This is the best zoo which I visited; the zoo is a little bit out from Hannover but it worth to see it. when you step in you are like the middle of a jungle. You don't have the feeling that those wild animals are not at home. I saw pelicans unleashed, jumping on alley - really",
          "We spent a day with our kids three years ago and they were so amazed that we had to visit again. The zoo is very well equipped, clean, the animals look healthy and the food quality and price is reasonable. On the flip side, do not expect extremely rare animals. All the",
          "the 2nd to visit in Germany , and finally we found elephants , It is very nice place not huge but a good place to spend your day .The atmosphere of the adventure and the travel from place to place is a very nice idea.",
          "So many varieties of species and i was fortunate to have good weather on the same day. Never seen Lion and zebras in the same enclosure as they kept here. It\u2019s good one time experience to visit (of course quite costly)",
          "There is no denying that a lot of money, time and effort has gone in to this zoo and it is beautifully thought out and executed. The best example of this is yukon bay! This place is spectacular and i highly recommend buying the documentary dvd which explains how it was built!",
          "I visited the zoo with a group of friends and this was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. There is a lot to see and the animals look really well taken care of and most of them have a lot of space to roam around. The lay out and design of the zoo is also very",
          "I love coming here, loads of places for the kids to play and the animals seem happy, and bonus you can take you dog on the premises too.",
          "Really nice and interactive. It gives the impression that the most of the animals are not so much contrained. Perfect for families with kids",
          "This has by far been one of my favourite zoo's ever. It has little sections for every area of the world and they have so many different and interesting animals there :) my favourite part was by far the polar bears because they are just so cute and they always put on a little",
          "This Zoo is amazing even in winter. Kids had so much fun iceskating and sledging. Really good entertainment for the whole family.",
          "Honestly, this was one of the highlights of my many trips to europe. If you are in Germany...somehow tyou have to put on your itinerary to go to Hannover Zoo. It is so well made and so many creative ideas. it has such a great relaxed vibe and so much fun. Perfect place to see",
          "We have loved going to the Zoo since our children were 3 and 5. They play in the sand and on the amazing playground. They are safe and entertained while my friends and I have coffee. Also my husband meets us for dinner sometimes and we have quality family time. Best value",
          "Price seems high at the beginning but you get a lot to see for it. I saw many mothers with maybe 2 year old kids who even had a 1-year-pass.",
          "Just spent an amazing day at Hannover zoo. A bit like a theme park with animals instead of rides! The detail in the Sambesi & Yukon areas is first class!! There are plenty of extras to keep the children entertained if looking at animals is not enough. I wanted to have a go at",
          "A great day to spend a bank holiday. The general layout was extremely interesting but having previously been informed that the zoo had recently been updated, expectations were high. However some areas were disappointing though the children's play areas exceeded all",
          "Although not the caliber of the San Diego Zoo, this zoo surprised me in its layout, health of animals, environment and cleanliness. I generally don't have high expectations of certain european amusement attractions, such as zoos, amusement parks, aquariums, etc, as I'm",
          "We come from Australia and have been to many many Zoo's.. but we think Hannover's is one of the best in the world. We will bring many family and friend as it is a great way to spend a day exploring :-)",
          "This zoo was probably one of the most unique zoos I've ever visited. The entire zoo had different themes and in each are the buildings, uniforms, and decor of each area was setup to immerse a visitor into that environment. Like the Disney World of zoos. The animals were",
          "Erlebnis zoo is very well laid out in themed areas. There are shows and show feedings throughout the day some at half hour and others at hourly intervals. The zoo is clean and tidy and all the animals appear very well cared for. There are several restaurants and each themed area",
          "It was a great place. I enjoyed the way the zoo is organized. They have a place for the polar bears and the wolfs that is just like a north pole scenario. You can see the bears swimming, and hanging out. They have a tropical forest with gorilas, chimpanzes and other monkeys. And",
          "This is an excellent zoo laid out in 5 different themes which represent different areas of the world. You need to allow 3/4 hours minimum to do this justice",
          "One of the best zoos we have ever visited - go and enjoy",
          "Good place for young and old to while away a few hours, one of the best zoos in Europe.",
          "We visited in December 2011 which was when they were doing the 'Winter Zoo' and it was a great experience. They had most of the usual animals to see (apart from a few that can't handle the cold) and also turned the central area into a winter wonderland with a large ice skating",
          "Distinct geographic areas are nicely arranged. All kind of different animals. Great 'expedition' canoe ride. And when you are tired, you can enjoy good food. Plenty of pay parking. Excellent public transportation access. ATM by the door. Only negative experience is that they",
          "We were invited here as guests and were well taken care of. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was good. We had a good long night here and the hours just flew past. Can't wait to visit again",
          "Clearly the animls here are well looked after and happy, with there lives enriched by many additions. The layout and presentation of the zoo is well thought out and the buildings/ surroundings very well selected",
          "This is a very nice zoo, even in wintertime. The different theme's are very nice. There where some animals we could not see, because they where inside. The food was not expensive and very tasty.",
          "Zoo Hannover is one of the best zoos I have visited in the last years. Recently renovated it has a beautiful area called yukon bay which looks exactly like you would walk through Canada. The animals look to feel comfortable and it looks like they would be in their natural",
          "Had a fantastic day @ Erlebenis Zoo. As i visited in January a lot of the animals had a been moved inside due to the cold temperatures and the river cruise through the zoo wasn't running but this didn't detract from the experience. Highlights include the Sloths and Orangutans",
          "Having been to many zoos around the world this one was clearly the best I have been to iin my life. And the most expensive, but fully worth the money. More than enough pparkin places to start with lots of cashier boxes so no waiting times there, the staff there pretty helpful",

        "wiki": "The Aviation Museum Hannover-Laatzen (German: Luftfahrtmuseum Hannover-Laatzen) is a permanent exhibition in Laatzen of the history of aviation. 38 airplanes, 800 aircraft models, and more than 30 aircraft engines are displayed on 3.500 m\u00b2.\nAmong the vast array of exhibits one can find an original Jumo 004A, one of the first jet engines in history, as well as a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and a Supermarine Spitfire. Aircraft from the postwar era include a MiG-15, an F-104 and an An-2.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe entrepreneur G\u00fcnter Leonhardt was already interested in gliding as a teenager and volunteered for the Luftwaffe. After the Second World War, Leonhardt created the Nelke shipping company, together with the businessman Karl Nelke. His passion was aviation, and he built a large private collection. For this he rescued several Ju-52 from a Norwegian lake in the Arctic Circle, which had sunk there in 1940. In 1992, he partially transferred his collection to the Aviation Museum Laatzen-Hannover, located on the premises of the company he by then owned. The company Nelke was sold in 1994.\nOn April 11, 2013, the Aviation Museum Laatzen-Hannover, the Aeronauticum in Nordholz, the Helicopter Museum B\u00fcckeburg and the Ju-52 Museum in Wunstorf have joined together to form the \"Association of Aviation Museums of Lower Saxony\" (\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft Nieders\u00e4chsischer Luftfahrtmuseen\").\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nExhibits include civilian and military aircraft. In addition to the aircraft collection are numerous items of everyday use, such as vehicles and clothing. Further emphasis is set on: the early days of aviation, daring pilots, the salvage of the Ju 52 in the Arctic Circle, the history of gliding and women in aviation. Exhibits are mostly arranged in chronological order, starting with the birth of aviation and ending with modern civil aviation.\n\n\n=== Airplanes ===\nAntonov An-2\nDornier Do 28 D-2\nFilter Schwan I\nFocke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz\nFocke-Wulf Fw 190 A-8\nFokker Dr.I, replica\nFokker E.III, replica\nGrade Eindecker, replica\nHFB 320 Hansa Jet\nHorv\u00e4th III, replica\nIkarus Windspiel 2\nJunkers F 13 a, replica\nKlemm L 25 D\nLilienthal Normalsegelapparat, replica\nLockheed F-104 Starfighter\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 G-2\nMikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15\nMikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (as Signpost)\nNieuport 17, replica\nPiaggio P.149 D\nRheinflug RW-3b\nRieseler R III/22, replica\nRyan M-2 NYP Spirit of St. Louis, replica\nScheibe L-Spatz 55\nSchneider Grunau Baby II\nDFS SG 38 Schulgleiter Two seater glider\nSopwith Camel, replica\nStampe SV-4c\nSupermarine Spitfire Mk.XIV\nTipsy Nipper\nUltralight-Aircraft A.

          "The museum offers a short and interesting history of aviation. Especially interesting is the exhibits with the first jet engines produced by the Germans during WWII. Most explanations are not translated into English which can be a bit of a hassle: Easy parking and not expensive.",

          "We were in Hannover for a few days and sought out a few indoor activities if the weather was poor. One of our 'Plan Bs' was the Luftfahrtmuseum in Laatzen. Fortunately(!) on the Saturday morning the weather was appalling, so we headed off to the museum - what an excellent",
          "A small museum near Hannover fair where you can spend a good 2-3 hours exploring the history of German aircrafts. There is always something new to learn when you visit a museum. Here I learned that the iconic Beetle car was built under the instruction of Hitler. It was built by",
          "It's a nice family oriented museum. Certainly not on a Smithsonian level for presentation, but the model airplanes are very cool. The engine exhibit is also really well done. I did see many items in English (not all) so perhaps the exhibits are expanding from the last review?",

          "A very good museum with an interesting exhibition that takes you from the pioneers of aviation to the jet fighter era. I was traveling with my 13 year old son. This was a great \u201dfather and son place\u201d to visit.",

          "The museum has it all from the birth of aviation to the First and Second World Wars and the Jet Age. Ticket prices are cheap, parking is free and it is an informative way to spend an afternoon. Many of the plaques are in Germany only, however.",
          "A tram trip from the city centre, then a good 10 minute walk great exhibits, thoroughly enjoyed it looks like it's been built in the middle of an industrial estate if travelling with someone with walking difficulties a taxi would be a good option. Exhibits are ground floor,",
          "The Luftfahrtmuseum Laatzen is a very interesting little museum which offers a great insight into German aviation from all eras of Germany's turbulent history. A must if you're in Hannover.",
          "If in Hanover, with a couple hours to spare, and you enjoy aircraft you won't be disappointed. Well set out in 2 hangars with exquisite small models of aircraft in glass cases lining the walls. Others contemporary items help put the aircraft in hangar 1 into context.",

          "This was a very interresting museum with quite a few aircrafts and countless of well made airplane models, (the models were actually built by an employee at the museum, impressive). If you are interrested in aeroplanes then this museum is a must.",

          "For some reason, I expected much more, but there are only handful of the real planes, most are either mock-ups (old ones) or presented as scale models (a lot!). You can see and peek into F-104G and MiG-15, check iside of the Ju-52 cabin, see frot parts of FW-190 and Me-109, as",

It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen.

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen.

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm.

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen. Its Great Garden is an important European baroque garden. The palace itself was largely destroyed by Allied bombing but has been reconstructed and reopened in 2013. Among the points of interest is the Grotto. Its interior was designed by the French artist Niki de Saint Phalle). The Great Garden consists of several parts and contains Europe's highest garden fountain. The historic Garden Theatre hosted the musicals of the German rock musician Heinz Rudolf Kunze.Also at Herrenhausen, the Berggarten is a botanical garden with the most varied collection of orchids in Europe. Some points of interest are the Tropical House, the Cactus House, the Canary House and the Orchid House, and free-flying birds and butterflies. Near the entrance to the Berggarten is the historic Library Pavillon. The Mausoleum of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. Like the Great Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the Paradies and the Prairie Garden. The Georgengarten is an English landscape garden. The Leibniz Temple and the Georgen Palace are two points of interest there.\nThe landmark of Hanover is the New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus). Inside the building are four scale models of the city. A worldwide unique diagonal/arch elevator goes up the large dome at a 17 degree angle to an observation deck.The Hanover Zoo received the Park Scout Award for the fourth year running in 2009/10, placing it among the best zoos in Germany. The zoo consists of several theme areas: Sambesi, Meyers Farm, Gorilla-Mountain, Jungle-Palace, and Mullewapp. Some smaller areas are Australia, the wooded area for wolves, and the so-called swimming area with many seabirds. There is also a tropical house, a jungle house, and a show arena. The new Canadian-themed area, Yukon Bay, opened in 2010. In 2010 the Hanover Zoo had over 1.6 million visitors. There is also the Sea Life Centre Hanover, which is the first tropical aquarium in Germany.Another point of interest is the Old Town. In the centre are the large Marktkirche (Church St. Georgii et Jacobi, preaching venue of the bishop of the Lutheran Landeskirche Hannovers) and the Old Town Hall. Nearby are the Leibniz House, the Nolte House, and the Beguine Tower.  The Kreuz-Church-Quarter around the Kreuz Church contains many little lanes. Nearby is the old royal sports hall, now called the Ballhof theatre. On the edge of the Old Town are the Market Hall, the Leine Palace, and the ruin of the Aegidien Church which is now a monument to the victims of war and violence. Through the Marstall Gate the bank of the river Leine can be reached; the Nanas of Niki de Saint Phalle are located here. They are part of the Mile of Sculptures, which starts from Trammplatz, leads along the river bank, crosses K\u00f6nigsworther Square, and ends at the entrance of the Georgengarten. Near the Old Town is the district of Calenberger Neustadt where the Catholic Basilica Minor of St. Clemens, the Reformed Church and the Lutheran Neust\u00e4dter Hof- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis are located.\nSome other popular sights are the Waterloo Column, the Laves House, the Wangenheim Palace, the Lower Saxony State Archives, the Hanover Playhouse, the Kr\u00f6pcke Clock, the Anzeiger Tower Block, the Administration Building of the NORD/LB, the Cupola Hall of the Congress Centre, the Lower Saxony Stock, the Ministry of Finance, the Garten Church, the Luther Church, the Gehry Tower (designed by the American architect Frank O. Gehry), the specially designed Bus Stops, the Opera House, the Central Station, the Maschsee lake and the city forest Eilenriede, which is one of the largest of its kind in Europe. With around 40 parks, forests and gardens, a couple of lakes, two rivers and one canal, Hanover offers a large variety of leisure activities.\nSince 2007 the historic Leibniz Letters, which can be viewed in the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library, are on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.\nOutside the city centre is the EXPO-Park, the former site of EXPO 2000. Some points of interest are the Planet M., the former German Pavillon, some nations' vacant pavilions, the Expowale, the EXPO-Plaza and the EXPO-Gardens (Parc Agricole, EXPO-Park South and the Gardens of change). The fairground can be reached by the Exponale, one of the largest pedestrian bridges in Europe.\nThe Hanover fairground is the largest exhibition centre in the world.\nIt provides 496,000 square metres of covered indoor space, 58,000 square metres of open-air space, 27 halls and pavilions. Many of the Exhibition Centre's halls are architectural highlights. Furthermore, it offers the Convention Center with its 35 function rooms, glassed-in areas between halls, grassy park-like recreation zones and its own heliport. Two important sights on the fairground are the Hermes Tower (88.8 metres high) and the EXPO Roof, the largest wooden roof in the world.In the district of Anderten is the European Cheese Centre, the only Cheese Experience Centre in Europe.

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm.

        "wiki": "The Leineschloss (English: Leine Palace), situated on the Leine in Hanover, Germany, is the former residence of the Hanoverian dukes, electors and kings. Currently it is the seat of the Landtag of Lower Saxony.\nThe first building on the site was a Franciscan friary, constructed in about 1300, which was abandoned in 1533 after the Protestant Reformation. In 1636, George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, began construction of a rather small late renaissance palace on the site as his residence. Elector Ernest Augustus had it enlarged and modernized and added a theatre in the late 17th century. In 1742 the north-west wing was renewed. Between 1816 and 1844, the architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves fully re-built the palace. The column portico with six Corinthian columns was built during this period.\nDuring World War II, the Leineschloss burnt out entirely after British aerial bombings. King George I of Great Britain was originally buried in the Chapel of the Leineschloss, but his remains, along with his parents', were moved to the 19th-century mausoleum of King Ernest Augustus in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Palace after World War II.  Architect Dieter Oesterlen re-built the palace between 1957 and 1962.\nIn August 2016 bones were found in the Leineschloss during a renovation project; it was believed that the bones were the remains of Philip Christoph von K\u00f6nigsmarck, the lover of the wife of the later king George I of Great Britain who was killed there in July, 1694. However, subsequent tests proved that some of the bones were from animals, while the human bones came from at least five different skeletons. None have been proven to belong to K\u00f6nigsmarck.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBurial places of British royalty\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Ernest Augustus (German: Ernst August; 5 June 1771 \u2013 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 until his death. As the fifth son of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover, initially he seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but none of his elder brothers had a legitimate son. Ernest succeeded in Hanover under Salic law, which barred women from the succession, ending the personal union between Britain and Hanover that had begun in 1714.\nErnest was born in London but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. He was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale in 1799. Although his mother Queen Charlotte disapproved of his marriage in 1815 to her twice-widowed niece, Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved happy. The King's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales (later King George IV), had one child, Charlotte, who was expected to become the British queen, but she died in 1817, giving Ernest some prospect of succeeding to the British throne as well as the Hanoverian one. However, his older brother Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British heir, Victoria, in 1819 shortly before the birth of Ernest's only child, George.\nErnest was an active member of the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet, had fathered a son by his sister Sophia, and intended to take the British throne by murdering Victoria. Following the death of his brother King William IV, Ernest became Hanover's first resident ruler since George I. He had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy near its start when he dismissed the G\u00f6ttingen Seven, including the two Brothers Grimm, from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies. A revolution in 1848 was quickly put down in Hanover. The kingdom joined the German customs union in 1850 despite Ernest's reluctance. He died the next year and was succeeded by his son George.\n\n\n== Early life (1771\u20131799) ==\n\nErnest Augustus, the fifth son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, was born at Buckingham House, London, on 5 June 1771, and baptised on 1 July 1771 at St James's Palace. After leaving the nursery, he lived with his two younger brothers, Prince Adolphus (later Duke of Cambridge) and Prince Augustus (later Duke of Sussex), and a tutor in a house on Kew Green, near his parents' residence at Kew Palace. Though the King never left England in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in their adolescence. According to the historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers. At the age of fifteen, Prince Ernest and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover. Ernest proved a keen student and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, he attended lectures at the university. Though King George ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines and that they follow the university's rules, the merchants of the Electorate proved willing to extend credit to the princes and all three fell into debt.\n\nIn 1790, Ernest asked his father for permission to train with Prussian forces. Instead, in January 1791, he and Prince Adolphus were sent to Hanover to receive military training under the supervision of Field Marshal Wilhelm von Freytag. Before leaving G\u00f6ttingen, Ernest penned a formal letter of thanks to the university and wrote to his father, \"I should be one of the most ungrateful of men if ever I was forgetful of all I owe to G\u00f6ttingen & its professors.\"As a lieutenant, Ernest learned cavalry drill and tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons and proved to be an excellent horseman, as well as a good shot. After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry.In March 1792, the King commissioned Prince Ernest Augustus as a colonel into the 9th Hanoverian Light Dragoons. The Prince served in the Low Countries in the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian and Austrian forces. Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre wound to the head, which resulted in a disfiguring scar. During the Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794, his left arm was injured by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in his left eye faded. In June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his first stay there since 1786.Ernest resumed his duties in early November, by now promoted to major-general. He hoped his new rank would bring him a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as the Allied armies retreated slowly through the Netherlands towards Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, holding several unimportant postings. He had requested a return home to seek treatment for his eye, but it was not until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain. There, Prince Ernest consulted a notable eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found his condition inoperable, as no operation took place. Once back in Britain, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join the British forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused him permission. Ernest did not want to rejoin the Hanoverian forces, as they were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, Freytag was seriously ill and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, Count von Wallmoden.\n\n\n== Duke of Cumberland ==\n\n\n=== Military commander ===\nOn 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh, and was granted an allowance of \u00a312,000 a year. Though he was made a lieutenant-general, of both British and Hanoverian forces, he remained in England and, with a seat in the House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views and soon became a leader of the right wing of the party. King George had feared that Ernest, like some of his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which led to the formation of the Addington government. In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy arose. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.\n\nIn early 1803, the Duke of York appointed Ernest as commander of the Severn District, in charge of the forces in and around the Severn Estuary. When war with France broke out again after the Peace of Amiens, the Duke appointed Ernest to the more important Southwest District, comprising Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire. Though Ernest would have preferred command of the King's German Legion, composed mostly of expatriates from French-occupied Hanover, he accepted the post. The Duke of Cumberland increased the defences on the South Coast, especially around the town of Weymouth, where his father often spent time in the summer.The 1800 Acts of Union had given Ireland representation in Parliament, but existing law prevented Irish Catholics from serving there because of their religion. \"Catholic emancipation\" was a major political issue of the first years of the 19th century. The Duke of Cumberland was a strong opponent of giving political rights to Catholics, believing that emancipation would be a violation of the King's Coronation Oath to uphold Anglicanism and spoke out in the House of Lords against emancipation. Protestant Irish organisations supported the Duke; he was elected Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1805 and Grand Master of the Orange Lodges two years later.The Duke repeatedly sought a post with Allied forces fighting against France, but was sent to the Continent only as an observer. In 1807, he advocated sending British troops to join the Prussians and Swedes in attacking the French at Stralsund (today, in northeastern Germany). The Grenville government refused to send forces. Shortly afterwards, the government fell and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland, agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. However, they were sent too late: the French defeated Prussia and Sweden at the Battle of Stralsund before Ernest and his forces could reach the town. Ernest was promoted to full general of the army in 1808, backdated to 1805.\n\n\n=== Sellis incident and Weymouth controversy ===\nIn the early hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, awakening him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study inquest law and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted that the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.\n\nMuch of the public blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious explanations for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had played a part in the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke to the fact that he did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house and assumed the worst.In early 1813, Ernest was involved in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown to be one of three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in an election to the House of Commons, there was considerable controversy and the government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies. Following this, Ernest received ultimate promotion, to Field Marshal, on 26 November 1813.\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\nErnest met and fell in love in mid-1813 with his first cousin, Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels and widow of Prince Louis of Prussia. The two agreed to wed if Frederica became free to marry. Her marriage to Frederick William had not been a success; her husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but his sudden death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too convenient and suspected the princess of poisoning her husband. Queen Charlotte opposed the marriage: before the princess had married Frederick William, she had jilted Ernest's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was announced.Following the marriage in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him money and the governorship of Hanover if they would leave for the Continent. Ernest refused and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace for the next three years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by \u00a36,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about \u00a3448,000 today), so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.At the time of the Duke's marriage in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, William, Duke of Clarence, and Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to secure the succession for another generation.Seeing little prospect of the Queen giving in and receiving her daughter-in-law, the Cumberlands moved to Germany in 1818. They had difficulty living within their means in Britain and the cost of living was much lower in Germany. Queen Charlotte died on 17 November 1818, but the Cumberlands remained in Germany, living principally in Berlin, where the Duchess had relatives. In 1817, the Duchess had a stillborn daughter; in 1819 she gave birth to a boy, Prince George of Cumberland. The Duke occasionally visited England, where he stayed with his eldest brother, who in 1820 succeeded to the British and Hanoverian thrones as George IV. George III's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, died six days before his father, but left a daughter, Princess Victoria of Kent. With the death of George III, Ernest became fourth in line to the British throne, following the Duke of York (who would die without legitimate issue in 1827), the Duke of Clarence and Princess Victoria. Returning to England, his political power was again considerable, as it seemed likely that he would succeed to the throne.\n\n\n=== Politics and unpopularity ===\n\nIn 1826, Parliament finally voted to increase Ernest's allowance. The Liverpool government argued that the Duke needed an increased allowance to pay for Prince George's education; even so, it was opposed by many Whigs. The bill, which passed the House of Commons 120\u201397, required Prince George to live in England if the Duke was to receive the money.In 1828, Ernest was staying with the King at Windsor Castle when severe disturbances broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington government announced that it would introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London and was one of the leading opponents to the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George IV against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have had considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have had little support in the Commons and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.The Wellington government hoped that Ernest would return to Germany, but he moved his wife and son to Britain in 1829. The Times reported that they would live at Windsor in the \"Devil's Tower\"; instead, the Duke reopened his house at Kew. They settled there as rumours flew that Thomas Garth, thought to be the illegitimate son of Ernest's sister Princess Sophia, had been fathered by Ernest. It was also said that Ernest had blackmailed the King by threatening to expose this secret, though Van der Kiste points out that Ernest would have been ill-advised to blackmail with a secret which, if exposed, would destroy him. These rumours were spread as Ernest journeyed to London to fight against Catholic emancipation. Whig politician and diarist Thomas Creevey wrote about the Garth rumour in mid-February and there is some indication the rumours began with Princess Lieven, wife of the Russian ambassador.Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, that the Duke had been thrown out of Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst. In early 1830, a number of newspapers printed articles hinting that Ernest was having an affair with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen, now past fifty. In February 1830, Lord Graves, Ernest's lord of the bedchamber and comptroller of his household, wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death (and the day after the inquest), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide\u2014or guilty of a second murder. The Duke later stated that he had been \"accused of every crime in the decalogue\". Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intention to return to Britain that \"a campaign of unparalleled viciousness\" began against him. The Duke of Wellington once told Charles Greville that George IV had said of Ernest's unpopularity, \"there was never a father well with his son, or husband with his wife, or lover with his mistress, or a friend with his friend, that he did not try to make mischief between them.\" According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.\n\nThe Duke's influence at Court was ended by the death of George IV in June 1830 and the succession of the Duke of Clarence as William IV. Wellington wrote that \"the effect of the King's death will ... be to put an end to the Duke of Cumberland's political character and power in this country entirely\". King William had no legitimate children (two daughters having died in infancy) and Ernest was now heir presumptive in Hanover, since the British heir presumptive, Princess Victoria, as a female could not inherit there. William realised that, so long as the Duke maintained a power base at Windsor, he could wield unwanted influence. The Duke was Gold Stick as head of the Household Cavalry; William made the Duke's post responsible to the Commander in Chief rather than to the King, and an insulted Ernest, outraged at the thought of having to report to an officer junior to himself, resigned.\nKing William again emerged triumphant when the new queen, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wished to quarter her horses in the stables customarily used by the consort, but which were then occupied by Ernest's horses. Ernest initially refused the King's order to remove the horses, but gave in when told that William's grooms would remove them if Ernest did not move them voluntarily. However, Ernest and William remained friendly throughout the latter's seven-year reign. Ernest's house at Kew was too small for his family; the King gave the Duke and Duchess lifetime residence in a nearby, larger house by the entrance to Kew Gardens. Ernest, who was against the extension of civil and religious liberties, opposed the Reform Act 1832 and was one of the \"diehard\" peers who voted against the bill on its final reading in which most Tories abstained under threat of seeing the House of Lords flooded with Whig peers. His unpopularity was deepened by the suggestion that he favoured the creation of Orange lodges in the army.Ernest was the subject of more allegations in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis and the jury found against the author. The Cumberlands suffered further tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye for several years; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped that his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely that George could win Princess Victoria's hand and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.The Duke spent William's reign in the House of Lords, where he was assiduous in his attendance. Wrote newspaper editor James Grant, \"He is literally\u2014the door-keeper of course excepted\u2014the first man in the House and the last out of it. And this not merely generally, but every night.\" Grant, in his observations of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not noted for his oratory (he delivered no speech longer than five minutes) and had a voice that was difficult to understand, though, \"his manner is most mild and conciliatory.\" Grant denigrated the Duke's intellect and influence, but stated that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that \"he is by no means so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose.\"Controversy arose in 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges (which took anti-Catholic views) were said to be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of Cumberland on the Throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph Hume, speaking in the House of Commons, Victoria was to be passed over on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity. The Commons passed a resolution calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, \"I would shed the last drop of my blood for my niece.\" The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that the Duke intended to murder the Princess and take the British throne for himself.\n\n\n== King of Hanover (1837\u20131851) ==\n\n\n=== Domestic affairs ===\n\n\n==== Constitutional controversy ====\nOn 20 June 1837, King William IV died; Victoria succeeded him as Queen of the United Kingdom, while Ernest Augustus became King of Hanover. On 28 June 1837, Ernest entered his new domain, passing under a triumphal arch. For the first time in over a century, Hanover would have a ruler living there. Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective and would have preferred the popular viceroy, the Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but both of Ernest's younger brothers refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. According to Roger Fulford in his study of George III's younger sons, Royal Dukes, \"In 1837, King Ernest was the only male descendant of George III who was willing and able to continue the connection with Hanover.\"\n\nHanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in 1819; this did little more than denote Hanover's change from an electorate to a kingdom, guaranteed by the Congress of Vienna.  The Duke of Cambridge, as King William's viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganisation of the Hanoverian government.  William IV had given his consent to a new constitution in 1833; the Duke of Cumberland's consent was neither asked nor received, and he had formally protested against the constitution's adoption without his consent. One provision of the constitution transferred the Hanoverian Domains (the equivalent of the British Crown Estate) from the sovereign to the state, eroding the monarch's power.Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the King dissolved the Hanoverian Parliament, which had been convened under the disputed constitution.  On 5 July, he proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the grounds that his consent had not been asked and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs. On 1 November 1837, the King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored.  His son, Crown Prince George, endorsed the action.In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at G\u00f6ttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths and agitated for others to protest against the King's decree.  Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover. Only one of the seven, orientalist Heinrich Ewald, was a citizen of Hanover, and he was not expelled. In the final years of the King's reign, the three were invited to return. The King wrote of the incident to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, \"If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, I would have had no cause to take exception to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the government had received their protest\u2014that is what they have done and that I cannot allow.\" Ernest received a deputation of G\u00f6ttingen citizens who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain. In the British House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British king, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British throne by his actions.A more significant protest against the revocation of the 1833 constitution was the refusal of a number of towns to appoint parliamentary deputies.  However, by 1840 a sufficient number of deputies had been appointed for the King to summon Parliament, which met for two weeks in August, approving a modified version of the 1819 constitution, passing a budget and sending a vote of thanks to the King.  The Parliament met again the following year, passed a three-year budget and adjourned again.\n\n\n==== National development and trade; 1848 crisis ====\nAt the time the King took the throne, the city of Hanover was a densely packed residential town and did not rise to the grand style of many German capitals.  Once the political crises of the first years of his reign had subsided, he set out to remedy this state of affairs. Ernest's support led to gas lighting in the city streets of Hanover, up-to-date sanitation and the development of a new residential quarter.  He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica's death, to leave standing the Altes Palais, where the two had lived since arriving in Hanover. Ernest's interest in and support of the railroads led to Hanover becoming a major railway junction, much to the nation's benefit. However, when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal \"this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this green field\". The King finally gave his consent in 1844 and the opera house opened in 1852, a year after the King's death.Every week, the King travelled with his secretary to different parts of his kingdom, and anyone could lay a petition before him\u2014although Ernest had petitions screened by the secretary so he would not have to deal with frivolous complaints. Ernest opened high ministerial positions to those of any class, securing the services of several ministers who would not have been eligible without this reform. Though the King had, while Duke of Cumberland, fought against Catholic emancipation in Britain and Ireland, he made no objection to Catholics in government service in Hanover and even visited their churches.  Ernest explained this by stating that there were no historical reasons to restrict Catholics in Hanover, as there had been in the United Kingdom. He continued to oppose admission of Jews into the British Parliament, but gave Jews in Hanover equal rights.The King supported a postal union and common currency among the German states, but opposed the Prussian-led customs union, the Zollverein, fearing that it would lead to Prussian dominance and the end of Hanover as an independent state. Instead, the King supported the Steuerverein, which Hanover and other western German states had formed in 1834.  When the Steuerverein treaties came up for renewal in 1841, Brunswick pulled out of the union and joined the Zollverein, greatly weakening Hanover's position, especially since Brunswick had enclaves within Hanover.  Ernest was able to postpone the enclaves' entry into the Zollverein and, when a trade war began, was able to outlast Brunswick.  In 1845, Brunswick, Hanover and Prussia signed a trade agreement.  In 1850, Ernest reluctantly permitted Hanover to join the Zollverein, though the entry was on favourable terms. Ernest's forebodings about Prussia were warranted; in 1866, fifteen years after his death, Hanover chose the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War, was defeated and was annexed by Prussia.Hanover was little affected by the revolutions of 1848; a few small disturbances were put down by the cavalry without bloodshed. When agitators arrived from Berlin at the end of May 1848 and there were demonstrations outside the King's palace, Ernest sent out the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister warned that, if the demonstrators made any inappropriate demands on the King, Ernest would pack up his things and leave for Britain, taking the Crown Prince with him.  This would leave the country at the mercy of expansionist Prussia and the threat put an end to the agitation.  Afterwards, the King granted a new constitution, somewhat more liberal than the 1819 document.\n\n\n=== Relations with Britain ===\n\nErnest Augustus is supposed to have asked the advice of the Duke of Wellington as to what course he should take after Victoria's accession, with Wellington supposedly saying \"Go before you are pelted out.\" However, Bird dismisses this story as unlikely, given Wellington's customary respect to royalty and the fact that Ernest had little choice in what to do\u2014he had to repair to his kingdom as quickly as possible. One decision the new king did have to make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords. Shortly after William's death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign sovereign. The King hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine. Ernest was heir presumptive to Queen Victoria until the birth of her daughter Victoria, Princess Royal, in November 1840.  The Lord Privy Seal, Lord Clarendon, wrote, \"What the country cares about is to have a life more, whether male or female, between the succession and the King of Hanover.\"Almost immediately upon going to Hanover, the King became involved in a dispute with his niece.  Queen Victoria had a strained relationship with her mother Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and wanted to give the Duchess accommodation near her, for the sake of appearances\u2014but not too near her. To that end, she asked the King to give up his apartments at St James's Palace in favour of the Duchess. The King, wishing to retain apartments in London in anticipation of frequent visits to England and reluctant to give way in favour of a woman who had frequently fought with his brother, King William, declined and the Queen angrily rented a house for her mother. At a time when the Queen was trying to pay off her father's debts, she saw this as an unnecessary expense. Her ill-feeling towards the King increased when he refused, and advised his two surviving brothers to refuse as well, to give precedence to her intended husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest argued that the standing of the various royal families had been settled at the Congress of Vienna and that the King of Hanover should not have to yield to one whom he described as a \"paper Royal Highness\". The act which naturalised Albert as a British subject left the question of his precedence unresolved.Matters came to a head when Ernest returned for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The prince, 48 years Ernest's junior, settled things with what Albert described as a \"strong push\" and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred on the grounds that they might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, \"When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me.\" Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, \"Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs.\" This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, \"No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!\" The Queen also recorded that though the King greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak. The King made a point of welcoming British visitors to Hanover and when one Englishwoman told him that she had been lost in the city, the King denied that this was possible, as \"the whole country is no larger than a fourpenny bit.\"The monarchs engaged in one more battle\u2014over jewels left by Queen Charlotte. Queen Victoria, who possessed them, took the position that they belonged to the British Crown. King Ernest maintained that they were to go to the heir male, that is, himself. The matter was arbitrated, and just as the arbitrators were about to announce a decision in Hanover's favour, one of the arbitrators died, voiding the decision. Despite the King's request for a new panel, Victoria refused to permit one during the King's lifetime and took every opportunity to wear the jewels, causing the King to write to his friend, Lord Strangford,\n\"The little Queen looked very fine, I hear, loaded down with my diamonds.\" The King's son and successor, King George V, pressed the matter, and in 1858, after another decision in Hanover's favour, the jewels were turned over to the Hanoverian ambassador.\n\n\n== Later life, death, and memorial ==\n\nIn 1851, the King undertook a number of journeys around Germany. He accepted an invitation from the Queen of Prussia to visit Charlottenburg Palace, near Berlin. He visited Mecklenburg for the christening of the Grand Duke's son and L\u00fcneburg to inspect his old regiment. In June, Ernest celebrated his 80th birthday by playing host to the King of Prussia. Late that summer, he visited G\u00f6ttingen, where he opened a new hospital and was given a torchlight procession.\nThe King continued his interest in British affairs and wrote to Lord Strangford about the Great Exhibition of 1851:\nThe folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the occasion. The idea ... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe.\n\nThe King died on 18 November 1851 after an illness of about a month. He was mourned greatly in Hanover; less so in England, where The Times omitted the customary black border to its front page and claimed \"the good that can be said of the Royal dead is little or none.\" Both he and Queen Frederica rest in a mausoleum in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Gardens.A large equestrian statue of King Ernest Augustus may be found in a square named after him in front of Hanover Central Station, inscribed with his name and the words (in German) \"To the father of the nation from his loyal people.\" It is a popular meeting place; in the local phrase, people arrange to meet unterm Schwanz or \"under the tail\" (that is, of the horse which the King rides).Although The Times denigrated Ernest's career as Duke of Cumberland, it did speak well of his time as King of Hanover and of his success in keeping Hanover stable in 1848:\n\nAbove all, he possessed a resolute decision of character, which, however unfortunately it may have operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak for it in the scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== British and Hanoverian ===\nKnight of the Garter (KG) \u2013 nominated 2 June 1786\nPrivy Council of Great Britain (later of the United Kingdom) (PC) \u2013 5 June 1799.

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen.

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen. Its Great Garden is an important European baroque garden. The palace itself was largely destroyed by Allied bombing but has been reconstructed and reopened in 2013. Among the points of interest is the Grotto. Its interior was designed by the French artist Niki de Saint Phalle). The Great Garden consists of several parts and contains Europe's highest garden fountain. The historic Garden Theatre hosted the musicals of the German rock musician Heinz Rudolf Kunze.Also at Herrenhausen, the Berggarten is a botanical garden with the most varied collection of orchids in Europe. Some points of interest are the Tropical House, the Cactus House, the Canary House and the Orchid House, and free-flying birds and butterflies. Near the entrance to the Berggarten is the historic Library Pavillon. The Mausoleum of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. Like the Great Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the Paradies and the Prairie Garden. The Georgengarten is an English landscape garden. The Leibniz Temple and the Georgen Palace are two points of interest there.\nThe landmark of Hanover is the New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus). Inside the building are four scale models of the city. A worldwide unique diagonal/arch elevator goes up the large dome at a 17 degree angle to an observation deck.The Hanover Zoo received the Park Scout Award for the fourth year running in 2009/10, placing it among the best zoos in Germany. The zoo consists of several theme areas: Sambesi, Meyers Farm, Gorilla-Mountain, Jungle-Palace, and Mullewapp. Some smaller areas are Australia, the wooded area for wolves, and the so-called swimming area with many seabirds. There is also a tropical house, a jungle house, and a show arena. The new Canadian-themed area, Yukon Bay, opened in 2010. In 2010 the Hanover Zoo had over 1.6 million visitors. There is also the Sea Life Centre Hanover, which is the first tropical aquarium in Germany.Another point of interest is the Old Town. In the centre are the large Marktkirche (Church St. Georgii et Jacobi, preaching venue of the bishop of the Lutheran Landeskirche Hannovers) and the Old Town Hall. Nearby are the Leibniz House, the Nolte House, and the Beguine Tower.  The Kreuz-Church-Quarter around the Kreuz Church contains many little lanes. Nearby is the old royal sports hall, now called the Ballhof theatre. On the edge of the Old Town are the Market Hall, the Leine Palace, and the ruin of the Aegidien Church which is now a monument to the victims of war and violence. Through the Marstall Gate the bank of the river Leine can be reached; the Nanas of Niki de Saint Phalle are located here. They are part of the Mile of Sculptures, which starts from Trammplatz, leads along the river bank, crosses K\u00f6nigsworther Square, and ends at the entrance of the Georgengarten. Near the Old Town is the district of Calenberger Neustadt where the Catholic Basilica Minor of St. Clemens, the Reformed Church and the Lutheran Neust\u00e4dter Hof- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis are located.\nSome other popular sights are the Waterloo Column, the Laves House, the Wangenheim Palace, the Lower Saxony State Archives, the Hanover Playhouse, the Kr\u00f6pcke Clock, the Anzeiger Tower Block, the Administration Building of the NORD/LB, the Cupola Hall of the Congress Centre, the Lower Saxony Stock, the Ministry of Finance, the Garten Church, the Luther Church, the Gehry Tower (designed by the American architect Frank O. Gehry), the specially designed Bus Stops, the Opera House, the Central Station, the Maschsee lake and the city forest Eilenriede, which is one of the largest of its kind in Europe. With around 40 parks, forests and gardens, a couple of lakes, two rivers and one canal, Hanover offers a large variety of leisure activities.\nSince 2007 the historic Leibniz Letters, which can be viewed in the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library, are on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.\nOutside the city centre is the EXPO-Park, the former site of EXPO 2000. Some points of interest are the Planet M., the former German Pavillon, some nations' vacant pavilions, the Expowale, the EXPO-Plaza and the EXPO-Gardens (Parc Agricole, EXPO-Park South and the Gardens of change). The fairground can be reached by the Exponale, one of the largest pedestrian bridges in Europe.\nThe Hanover fairground is the largest exhibition centre in the world.\nIt provides 496,000 square metres of covered indoor space, 58,000 square metres of open-air space, 27 halls and pavilions. Many of the Exhibition Centre's halls are architectural highlights. Furthermore, it offers the Convention Center with its 35 function rooms, glassed-in areas between halls, grassy park-like recreation zones and its own heliport. Two important sights on the fairground are the Hermes Tower (88.8 metres high) and the EXPO Roof, the largest wooden roof in the world.In the district of Anderten is the European Cheese Centre, the only Cheese Experience Centre in Europe. Another tourist sight in Anderten is the Hindenburg Lock, which was the biggest lock in Europe at the time of its construction in 1928. The Tiergarten (literally the \"animals' garden\") in the district of Kirchrode is a large forest originally used for deer and other game for the king's table.\nIn the district of Gro\u00df-Buchholz the 282-metre-high Telemax is located, which is the tallest building in Lower Saxony and the highest television tower in Northern Germany. Some other notable towers are the VW-Tower in the city centre and the old towers of the former middle-age defence belt: D\u00f6hrener Tower, Lister Tower and the Horse Tower.\nThe 36 most important sights of the city centre are connected with a 4.2 kilometres (3 mi)-long red line, which is painted on the pavement. This so-called Red Thread marks out a walk that starts at the Tourist Information Office and ends on the Ernst-August-Square in front of the central station. There is also a guided sightseeing-bus tour through the city.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Religious life ===\nHanover is headquarters for several Protestant organizations, including the World Communion of Reformed Churches, the Evangelical Church in Germany, the Reformed Alliance, the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany, and the Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church.\nIn 2015, 31.1% of the population were Protestant and 13.4% were Roman Catholic. The majority 55.5% were irreligious or other faith.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nThe Historic Museum describes the history of Hanover, from the medieval settlement \"Honovere\" to the world-famous Exhibition City of today. The museum focuses on the period from 1714 to 1834 when Hanover had a strong relationship with the British royal house.\nWith more than 4,000 members, the Kestnergesellschaft is the largest art society in Germany.

          "Super choices, a few fruit and veggies stands but mostly small restaurants. Truly one could try something different every day for a week and not be bored. We've tried a number of similar markets across Europe and this is one of the better ones.",
          "We walked here to have breakfast , which was enjoyable. I bought olives , feta cheese, fresh bread etc all at a very reasonable price.",
          "We stopped at a second floor stall, where the guy was preparing everything from scratch. Got a delicious pile of the freshest seafood and a plate of top grilled meat.yummy",
          "Missed this building on the \"red thread tour\" as it doesn\u2019t look like a market hall from outside. It\u2019s a great place to grab an informal lunch or early evening snack as it has many small bars, cafes and take-away stalls inside. Also some bakeries and fresh local produce.",
          "Great casual place to stop in for lunch or drinks. Patronized mostly by locals, so many choices. Colorful and Fun atmosphere. Start by walking through the stalls and watching what the locals order, then go back to your order favorite!",
          "We entered the market when we were on our way to the rat house. It looked promising so we entered again on our way back for a complete check. We're very glad that we did. Better to get here hungry because the food is great and not expensive. A very good choice for people who are",
          "its a great food market,theres alot of food varieties to choose of and its really cheap,i like to go there but sometimes its hard to find a seat there :/",
          "The Markthalle is not that big, compared with other food halls I've visited. But it is the place for a good breakfast or lunch. It is also very popular with the locals, always a good sign. Almost all the stalls where you can buy food, have tables and chairs. So come hungry.",
          "I regularly eat at this fish restaurant. it represents great value for money with excellent fresh fish well prepared and served by very helpful friendly staff. great value for money. Now that the Markthalle is smoker free it is a delight to eat there.",
          "Just enjoyed the place and will definitely go again, for those of you like to enjoy eating, just go you will love it. I especially enjoyed a kurdish iraqi family preparing spanish speciality fish dishes, they were really friendly and I loved their mixed fishes dish!",
          "Such colorful pictures possible: cooked foods, pastries, produce - all just waiting to have their pictures taken. Come hungry. You won't know where to start. And the prices couldn't be cheaper: 1 Euro for breakfast, 3.50 Euros for lunch - a huge hot meal. I went back more",
          "Had lunch here on Friday. Good variety of stalls serving many different cuisines. This place is really popular with the locals and for good reason. Clean, good service from friendly staff and a great selection from snacks to full meals.",
          "I thought of the name that it would be a very busy and bustling place. However, there was nothing much going on. We went early evening around 4pm. There was a couple of stalls you could buy fresh fruit and veggies, as well as local food to buy.",
          "I can see why they call this place the Belly of Hannover. Over 75 food stalls offering everything, and anything you would possibly want to eat. Great place to grab lunch, do some shopping, have a cappuccino, visit the butcher, sample some cheese, all before visiting your tailor",
          "Lots of local ans international food suppliers and cafes. Grea t place to pick up food for self caterers and enjoy a glass of wine. Could only be improved if it had an outside seating area.",
          "This place is surely not worth it it's like your going grocery shopping , it stinks and place for grannies and grandpa's",
          "There is so much to do. I have seen concerts in the Church. This is also the shopping district of Hannover as it touches on Kropcke. It is a must stop, wander, enjoy place - great for souveniers, both high end and low."

      "name": "Hermann L\u00f6ns Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Hermann L\u00f6ns (29 August 1866 \u2013 26 September 1914) was a German journalist and writer. He is most famous as \"The Poet of the Heath\" for his novels and poems celebrating the people and landscape of the North German moors, particularly the L\u00fcneburg Heath in Lower Saxony. L\u00f6ns is well known in Germany for his famous folksongs. He was also a hunter, natural historian and conservationist. Despite being well over the normal recruitment age, L\u00f6ns enlisted and was killed in World War I and his purported remains were later used by the German government for celebratory purposes.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nHermann L\u00f6ns was born on 29 August 1866 in Kulm (now Che\u0142mno, Poland) in West Prussia. He was one of twelve siblings, of whom five died early. His parents were Friedrich Wilhelm L\u00f6ns (1832\u20131908) from Bochum, a teacher, and Klara (n\u00e9e Cramer, 1844\u201396) from Paderborn. Hermann L\u00f6ns grew up in Deutsch-Krone (West Prussia). In 1884, the family relocated back to Westfalen as his father found a position in M\u00fcnster. A sickly child who survived typhus, L\u00f6ns graduated from school on his second try with the Abitur in 1886. Urged by his father, he began to attend courses at M\u00fcnster university in preparation for studying medicine. In 1887, he started his studies at the University of Greifswald. There he joined a dueling fraternity (Turnerschaft Cimbria), but was dismissed cum infamia (with infamy). In November 1888, L\u00f6ns relocated to the university of G\u00f6ttingen, but returned to M\u00fcnster without having attained a degree. In fact, he never even enrolled at G\u00f6ttingen but joined a drinking society called the Club der Bewusstlosen. At M\u00fcnster he studied natural sciences emphasizing zoology at the Theologische und Philosophische Akademie from the spring of 1889 to autumn 1890. While there, he developed interests in environmental issues \u2013 protecting nature from damage by industrial activity \u2013 and in literature. However, he was also arrested in 1889 for disorderly conduct and sentenced to five days in jail for extinguishing gas lights and resisting arrest while drunk.\nIn the autumn of 1891, L\u00f6ns decided to quit university without graduating and to become a journalist. He went first to Kaiserslautern, where he worked for the newspaper Pf\u00e4lzische Presse. He was dismissed after five months for being late and for being drunk. L\u00f6ns then went to Gera where he again became an assistant editor, this time for the Reu\u00dfische Volkszeitung. He also lost that job after three weeks, again for being drunk. L\u00f6ns then started work as a freelance reporter for the Hannoveraner Anzeiger. From 1892, L\u00f6ns lived in Hanover and as a regional news editor wrote about a wide variety of subjects. Some of his writings with the pseudonym \"Fritz von der Leine\" were collected as a book Ausgew\u00e4hlte Werke von Fritz von der Leine, published in 1902. The year before, L\u00f6ns had published a collection of poetry and a book of short stories on hunting. In 1902, L\u00f6ns quit the newspaper and co-founded the rival newspaper Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung. In April 1903, he became its editor-in-chief, but by February 1904 the newspaper folded due to a lack of funds. L\u00f6ns then joined the Hannoversches Tagblatt, writing as \"Ulenspeigel\". It was at this time that L\u00f6ns began to make a name for himself as a writer on nature, in particular on the heaths of Lower Saxony (Heidedichter). In 1906, he published these writings in Mein braunes Buch which became his first literary success. L\u00f6ns became editor-in-chief of the newspaper Schaumburg-Lippische Landeszeitung of B\u00fcckeburg in 1907, and remained in this position  through April 1909. Once again, alcohol consumption was the cause of his dismissal.Freed from the need to do regular work as a newspaper man, L\u00f6ns wrote and published several more of his works in 1909, emphasizing animal studies and characterization, including the popular M\u00fcmmelmann. That same year, he wrote three more novels, two of which were published in 1910, including Der Wehrwolf, his most successful book, depicting the bloody revenge of Lower Saxony peasants against marauding soldiers of the Thirty Years War. The poems contained in the collection Der kleine Rosengarten (1911) were referred to by L\u00f6ns as \"folk songs\" (Volkslieder). They included the Matrosenlied (\"Sailors' Song\") with the chorus Denn wir fahren gegen Engelland (\"For we are sailing against England\"), which was put to music by Herms Niel and became one of the most-sung German military songs of World War II. \nA number of his poems from Der kleine Rosengarten were set to music by Franz Gabriel [1883-1929] in 1927-8 and published in an album with a dedication to the tenor, Richard Tauber, who recorded 13 of them for Odeon in August 1928. Another of his poems, Das Geheimnis [The Secret], beginning 'Ja, gr\u00fcn ist die Heide', was set to music by Karl Blume and recorded by Tauber in 1932.\n\n\n== Marriages and divorces ==\nL\u00f6ns had married Elisabet Erbeck (1864\u20131922), a divorced sales assistant, at Hanover in 1893 (engagement 1890, divorced 1901). She had five miscarriages and was committed to a sanatorium. Soon after the divorce, L\u00f6ns had changed his confession from Catholic to Protestant and married Lisa Hausmann (an editorial assistant, born 1871), also at Hanover. He had a child with his second wife, but their son was mentally and physically handicapped. In 1911, his family left him, after he fired a shotgun inside their home. In the divorce proceedings he had a nervous breakdown. L\u00f6ns refused to pay alimony and then left without leaving an address, travelling in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. In November 1911, L\u00f6ns considered suicide. In November 1912, he returned to Hanover and subsequently published two more collections of hunting and nature stories Auf der Wildbahn (1912) and Mein buntes Buch (1913), followed by his final novel, Die H\u00e4user von Ohlendorf (1913). Suffering from bipolar disorder, L\u00f6ns veered between depression and making fantastic plans for the future.\n\n\n== First World War service ==\nAt the age of 48, he volunteered for service with the German Army for the First World War. Due to his ill health and weak constitution, he was rejected initially by the military. It took the intervention of an officer friend of his for L\u00f6ns to be accepted as a common fusilier by the Ersatzbatallion of the Regiment Generalfeldmarschall Prinz Albrecht von Preu\u00dfen, also known as 73rd Fusilier Regiment. On 26 September 1914, just three weeks after enlisting on 3 September, L\u00f6ns was killed in action during an assault on a French position at Loivre near Reims in France. Of the 120 men in his unit only two dozen survived.\n\n\n== Reception in National Socialist Germany ==\n\nL\u00f6ns' books continued to sell well after his death. By 1934, they had reached an overall circulation of 2.5 million books. By 1938, the Wehrwolf had sold more than 500,000 copies (reaching 865,000 copies by 1945). This made him one of the most successful authors in Germany at the time.L\u00f6ns had considered himself as a poet of nature and he had argued eloquently for conservationism. He was co-initiator of the Heideschutzpark at Wilseder Berg which later grew into the Naturpark L\u00fcneburger Heide (L\u00fcneburg Heath Nature Park), the first nature reserve in Germany. L\u00f6ns combined these sentiments, based not least on the Heimatbewegung of the turn of the century (as represented by Adolf Bartels) with an increasingly radical nationalism, the racist concept of an \"aristocratic peasantry\" (Blood and soil), enmity towards the metropolis (Berlin) and xenophobia. His literary work has been categorised as part of the folkish philosophy, although his character was also one of intense individualism.As some of his writings had included nationalistic ideas, he was considered by the National Socialists as one of their writers. Some parts of his works conformed well with the \"Blood and soil\" ethos endorsed by National Socialist ideologues such as Walther Darre and Alfred Rosenberg, which lauded the peasantry and small rural communities as the true character of the German nation.\nOn 5 January 1933, a French farmer found the boots of a German soldier in one of his fields. With the help of the local sexton, he uncovered a skeleton and identification tag. The sexton buried the body in an individual grave in a German graveyard near Loivre. It took almost 18 months for the tag to reach Berlin via the German embassy in France. This tag was subsequently lost during an Allied bombing raid on Berlin; an extant photograph of it does not allow a definite conclusion on whether the tag said \"F.R.\" (F\u00fcselier-Regiment) or \"I.R.\" (Infanterie-Regiment). However, on 8 May 1934 the newspaper V\u00f6lkische Beobachter announced that the grave of L\u00f6ns had been discovered. In October 1934, at the behest of Adolf Hitler, L\u00f6ns' purported body was exhumed and brought to Germany. There was not any medical examination to try to verify that these were indeed the remains of the writer.\nIn 1919, several bodies had been exhumed in the vicinity of the area where L\u00f6ns was killed and transferred to the war cemetery at Luxembourg. From there they were moved to a mass grave near Loivre, where they remain to this day, according to the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr\u00e4berf\u00fcrsorge, a charity. It is quite possible that L\u00f6ns' remains were among them.The exhumed body of L\u00f6ns was supposed to be buried in the L\u00fcneburg Heath, given his association with the area. However, the exact location of his new grave posed problems. The initial plan to bury him at the Sieben Steinh\u00e4user, a megalithic site, was abandoned since the military at the time had (still secret) plans to establish the military training facility Bergen in the area. An alternative site near Wilseder Berg was rejected due to concerns about the environmental effect of large numbers of visitors to the grave. Finding a suitable burial place became an issue for the top echelons of the regime, including Hermann G\u00f6ring, Rudolf He\u00df, Joseph Goebbels, Werner von Blomberg and even Adolf Hitler.\nOn 30 November 1934, members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), apparently on orders from Goebbels, removed the remains from the graveyard chapel in Fallingbostel where they were awaiting reburial. They buried them near the roadside of what was then Reichsstrasse 3 (now Bundesstrasse 3 or B3) south of Barrl, near the area known presently as Reinsehlen Camp. However, on 2 August 1935, the anniversary of the start of World War I, on the initiative of von Blomberg, Minister of War, the Reichswehr exhumed the remains and transferred them to the Tietlinger Wacholderhain near Walsrode, where an earlier (1929) memorial had been erected, for a ceremonial reburial.\n\n\n== Later reception ==\nAfter 1945, L\u00f6ns remained a bestselling author. The company that published most of his works estimated that by 1966 they had sold 7.5 million books written by him.The 1932 movie Gr\u00fcn ist die Heide (Green Is The Heath) was based on L\u00f6ns' writings. It was remade with great commercial success in 1951, featuring Sonja Ziemann and Rudolf Prack, and again in 1972.\nIn 1956, Dieter Borsche featured as L\u00f6ns in Rot ist die Liebe, a German movie based on L\u00f6ns' autobiography Das zweite Gesicht.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nThere are 113 memorials total to L\u00f6ns in Germany plus eight in Austria and 19 in other countries. Additionally, 247 streets and roads in Germany have been named for him. Twelve schools have his name. Finally, there is Hermann L\u00f6ns Stadium at Paderborn.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMein goldenes Buch, 1901\nAusgew\u00e4hlte Werke von Fritz von der Leine, 1902\nMein braunes Buch, 1906\nM\u00fcmmelmann, 1909\nContributions to Lebensbilder aus der Tierwelt (edited by Hermann Meerwarth), 1910\u201312\nMein blaues Buch, 1909\nDer letzte Hansbur, 1909\nDahinten in der Haide, 1910\nDer Wehrwolf, 1910\nDer kleine Rosengarten, 1911, from which the song Auf der L\u00fcneburger Heide was derived.\nDas zweite Gesicht, 1912\nAuf der Wildbahn, 1912\nMein buntes Buch, 1913\nDie H\u00e4user von Ohlendorf, 1913\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by Hermann L\u00f6ns at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Hermann L\u00f6ns at Internet Archive\nWorks by Hermann L\u00f6ns at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nHermann-L\u00f6ns-Verband e.V.

        "wiki": "Marienburg Castle is a Gothic revival castle in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north-west of Hildesheim, and around 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Hannover, in the municipality of Pattensen, Hannover. It was also a summer residence of the House of Guelph whose flag (in the colours of yellow and white) flies on the main tower. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe castle was built between 1858 and 1867 as a birthday present by King George V of Hanover (reigned 1851\u20131866) to his wife, Marie of Saxe-Altenburg. Between 1714 and 1837 there had been virtually no royal court in Hannover as the House of Hannover had ruled the kingdoms of Hannover and Britain by personal union, and so the Castle was also built to serve as a suitable summer seat for the House of Hannover in Germany, besides the Royal Leine Palace and Herrenhausen Palace in Hannover.\nIts architect was Conrad Wilhelm Hase, one of Hannover's most influential architects. Due to Hannover being annexed by Prussia in 1866, the castle was left uninhabited for 80 years after the royal family went into exile at Gmunden, Austria, where they lived in the Queen's Villa and, later, Cumberland Castle. Therefore Marienburg is well preserved, as few renovations were done until 80 years later when it was safe to come back. Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick and his wife Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia moved to Marienburg in 1945, when forced to leave Blankenburg Castle. In 1954 their son, Prince Ernest Augustus IV, opened the castle museum after having moved to nearby Calenberg Demesne. \n\n\n== The castle today ==\n\nThe castle was owned by Prince Ernst August of Hanover, after his father signed it over to him in 2004, together with all other royal properties at Hanover and Gmunden. The castle housed the property management offices of the Royal House of Hanover and served as its official seat. Parts of it were open to the public, such as the castle museum, the restaurant, the chapel, and could be booked as an event location for weddings, receptions, concerts, etc. In 2010 the youth series \"In your dreams\" was filmed in the castle.\nIn 2014, the prince lent a number of paintings and objects to the Lower Saxony state exhibition When the Royals came from Hannover - The rulers of Hannover on England's throne, an exhibition taking place in five museums and castles, under the protectorate of HRH Charles, Prince of Wales. 30 of more than 1000 items had been contributed by HM The Queen, including the State Crown of George I, while Ernst August provided the king's famous Augsburg silver throne and other silver furniture of 1720, as well as the Hannoverian crown jewels. He is hosting a parallel exhibition, The Way to the Crown, at Marienburg Castle until the end of 2016, showing - among other items such as the silver furniture - the crown jewels of the Kingdom of Hannover. On 6 July 2017 the prince hosted his wedding ball in the castle.\nIn November 2018, Prince Ernst August announced the transfer of ownership of the castle to the state of Lower Saxony, as its repair and maintenance costs were too great for him to sustain. Renovation costs of the castle, partly infested with dry rot and threatened by static problems, are estimated at 27 million Euros. He planned to transfer ownership to a state-controlled foundation (the Hanoverian Monasteries' Chamber, founded by his family in 1569, which still owns most of the secularized monasteries and ecclesiastical estates of the former kingdom), at a symbolic sales price of 1 Euro, with the foundation undertaking renovation. The remaining art collection was planned to be kept in the castle, with parts purchased by the state, parts kept by the family and lent to the state, and parts transferred to a foundation controlled by both the family and the state. The transaction however was stopped in the spring of 2019 by his father's legal action, seeking to regain ownership.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in German)\nOfficial website (in English)",

          "The beating heart of Hannover, at the crossroads of the train station street, Georgestrasse and the opern road, it is best to visit at Christmas time, for the joyful feel, the gluchwein and the happy people all around. A short distance from Kropke Uhr there are loads of shopping",
          "Hanover residents have a complex system of meeting places. There are at least three meeting places on a short stretch in the center:\" under the tail \" of Ernst August's horse at the station, near this clock and near the fountain of fallen leaves. The Kr\u00f6pcke-Uhr were established",
          "These clocks are one of those things which makes our cities beautiful without too much noticing them unless we look for the meeting point. Anyway I recommend to stop for a while as they are just cute and worth a bit of attention. They are also a nice detail for a street",
          "The clock of Kropcke is nice but it is not too interesting. The clock has cubic structure building and due to its shape and form, has different view from each side. This shape exists in too many of structures in world.",
          "For shopping lovers, its the commercial center where you will enjoy, from food, clothing, souvenirs, etc., just be ready with your budget to enjoy the day.",
          "Centrally located next to the Kr\u00f6pke railway (S-Bahn) station which is close to the main railway station of Hannover",
          "This clock is in the middle of the pedestrian shopping area of the city, so it's quite easy to find. Clock itself is nice, but nothing special to be honest.",
          "Although this is actually a replica from the one from the 1880's, it is still a nice thing to see. Was all lit up, and had a dusting of snow on it often when we passed it every day on our way to or from the hotel..",
          "This is a clock in the centre of the pedestrian shopping area. It is fine but is not very large, and when we were there the blinds were down so we could not see inside. Be warned that while it is in a pedestrian area this is used by cyclists who ride at speed weaving in-between",
          "Just normal place.. around uhr can be visited as city center.. that area is the just center , especially starting from hauptbahnof to georgstraBe..",
          "A great place to sit and watch the people go by Excellent location for all the shopping one will do Great location for cafes and restaurants!!",
          "But the old fashioned Kropcke clock is a bit of a mismatch on the modern chaotic busy Kropcke square in central Hannover. Not much coherence and continuity there. A consolation is that the clock is only a replica of the original 19th century clock, installed in 1977. Not much",
          "A very nice place to visit if you have few minutes to spend in Hannover center. It's only few minutes from the central station",
          "There is definitely not much to do there, but it is a fine place for friends to find each other for a date.",
          "The clock and the area around it are not that special, unless you do some reading about why it is called Kropcke. Than this place gets an additional dimension and you appreciate the clock and the place more. My suggestion: read first and go later.",
          "Hannover may b a small city but it has its own warmth in its weather n people. I love this place. During my 5 days stay over there, it was one of my favorite place for diner and shopping. Hbf is also in d vicinity so it is one of d main tourist point in Hannover.",
          "This is not worth going to see unless you just happen to be in the area. I don't think that I would make a special trip for it.",
          "The Kropcke is a great place to explore if looking to shop for various items. It's a worthy visit if walking to/from the Hauptbahnof, but overall busier and more crowded than I prefer. There are some historical monuments here worthy of checking out, including the reproduction",
          "It you are around, for sure take 5 minutes to pop by; in my opinion do not organize to go there or to stop buses to go there on pourpose, not worth it!!",
          "Just few minutes walk from Hannover Hbf (central station), this is a popular meeting place for locals and tourists. Beautiful old clock located at the junction, surrounded by various shops. Usually there are some nearby street music performers showing their skills.",

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen.

          "It was better than I expected, the animals where in mini parks whichever were kind of aligned to their natural habitat. Some were alone though , which made my niece unhappy, as all animals should have friends in her view, which may not be probably possible. She liked the",

          "Zoo has a huge and nice area with a great variety of animals (I miss birds). All environments look like movie sets. Sometimes, having so many furnitures and scenery makes harder to see the animals due to small space to accomodate everybody who is visiting the zoo. There is a",

          "This wasn't the cheapest day out by any measure but this was one of those defining points in my wife and children's lives that they WILL not forget. The zoo itself is undergoing some improvement work and thus from the outside it doesn't look the best. I would also say that",

          "The zoo is really amazing! I liked that for each section there is a different theme, it was awesome. Also we managed to catch quite a number of shows, no wonder we spent almost half of the day there. :)",
          "This is the best zoo I've ever been to. It's had lots of investment over the last decade or so and the themed areas are very special and make you feel like you're on a trip abroad - the African area with the Sambesi boat ride, the Yukon Bay Area which houses wolves, polar bears,",
          "Visited in Feb but would like to go again but in summer as you get to see more and do more. It was still a nice day to go and explore the zoo. It took about two hours to see everything although you could spend much longer. Definitely recommended if you are going to Hannover",
          "The animals are so unhappy. It's sad to see them like this. It was the the first time at the zoo for me and definitely the last one.",
          "We go to loads of Zoos. We didn't really plan on Hannover Zoo, we thought we would go to a different one that we had researched, but this was closer. You can get the metro out to the zoo, which is a quick and pleasant journey. The zoo is quite spread out, so there is much",
          "I visited the Zoo for the first time after four years living in hannover and I wish I did it before. It is a nice place. I have only gone in summer time and you could see all the animals. The polar bear is amazing to watch sumerge in the water. I was told by friends that went in",
          "We visited the zoo as a family, three children and two adults. The entrance fee was very reasonable. There is a vast range of animals to see and the enclosures are constructed in such a way that you get great views. For example the Hippo enclosure is glass fronted so you get to",
          "This zoo is really fun! Make sure you make it in time for all their shows! They are sure cool and fun! (They are all in German but you can still have a fun time if you don't know German) Their animals seem to be having a better life than other zoos I've been to!",
          "This isn't the place to visit during winter months, as we found out. The price is still 19.50Euro each, which is rather steep, considering how little there is to see and do. It would have been nice to be told that most parts are closed or being renovated. We visited last year",
          "I enjoy this zoo,every time i come and visit. The africa part is what i like most about it. Cool animals",
          "Visited the Zoo on 30 November which is Winter season. Opening hours are 10am - 4pm. The entry still costs \u20ac19.50 pp which is expensive considering many of the attractions and enclosures are closed or being renovated. Very few people visiting but it was very cold - even the",
          "My partner and I had a day to kill in Hannover - so we decided to visit the zoo. I wasn't really expecting much but it was probably the best zoo I have ever been to. Personal highlight was the boat ride, which takes you around part of the zoo. A really lovely way to spend an",
          "Unfortunately we only got to see the polar bear being fed, because we went there late, nevertheless it was an amazing experience, the zoo stood out because it reminded me of an old western movie place, saloon like, and the lights outside was very pretty.\\ The restaurant was",
          "I'm not a fan of zoos always but I know they do a lot of good work with conservation. We enjoyed the trip around the little waterway but on the whole I felt the gorilla looked really sad and bored and barged up to window and shoulder barged it and also the polar bear enclosure",
          "One of the best Zoos you can find in Germany. The Zoo is going a longterm transformation from a former visitor centric Zoo with bad condutions for the animals to a entertaining Zoo where animals are treated with equivalent rights. The animals live in thematic enclosures, have",
          "The zoo offers a great variety of animals and puts a great deal of effort (and investment) into creating attractive environments (Yukon, Africa, India, etc.). They also have a very nice restaurant and beer garden, Meyer's Hof, that you can sometimes get to without paying the",
          "Thanks for this place beutifull animal inside.. I advice the poeple to go there With children because the place to play",
          "Visited alone when on aholiday from australia. Great zoo worth a visit even for an adult, enclosures are really well made and lots of different animals compared to other zoos i have seen! Worth watching the polar bear feeding if you are there at that time, it is in german but",
          "If you are looking for something to do in Hannover with or without kids/babies, zoo is the best choice.",
          "We found this zoo perfect and complete. Beautiful places and locations had been designed very good according to genre, type of each animals. I suggest to each people who has interests on nature and wild life, to spend enough time more than 6 hours to can get a complete tour in",
          "It was very cold when we went but the zoo was really quiet because of this and the fact it was a school day in Germany There were a lot of different animals and you could get a good view of them all.The kids really enjoyed it and the food in the cafe was reasonable. There were",
          "We went to this zoo with my 6yr old grandson. I don't agree with zoo's generally, but he wanted to see a polar bear. A good day out it has to be said but a zoo is a zoo, and a cage no matter how well its kitted out, still remains a cage. We arrived about 11am and stayed all day",
          "We have small kids and visit the zoo about once every 1-2 years. This was our 4th and last visit. It is an absolutely over priced activity (\u20ac87 for a family of 4). There are 3 major things wrong with this place: 1. People are allowed to smoke and they do it everywhere. 2. The",
          "really good zoo.loved the different themed areas.zambezi river,yukon area(including polar bears),india and then Australia.it was well thought out and easy to get around.didnt get lost and spent all day there",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by Erlebnis Zoo even though some of the animals, such as the Giraffes and Zebras weren't present do to problems with their terrain. We have visited the zoo in Hamburg for the last couple of years, where theirs is a really pretty well kept zoo,",
          "A very enjoyable visit to the adventure Zoo in Hannover. Great attractions - India themed elephant enclosure, Alaskan themed polar station as well as a great play ground with adventure castle and massive sand pit! All this is rounded up in the end with a beautiful Farmers range",
          "We have been to a lot of different zoos, but this one is overall the best one we have been to so far! This was our second time here. t has a lot of great attraction for the kids (ours are 3,5,7 years old), and you get really close to the animals. We love it!",
          "We saw a make believe African School and a village. We learnt that there are 3 types of zebras. There were lions, zebras, penguins, even leopards and elephants. You could touch ivory. I would recommend this to everyone. Yukon Bay had a lone wolf - quite literally. We also",
          "So we go to a lot of zoos - in all sorts of places. And this one was really very nice. Not huge but lovely layout and decent selection of animals. The Yukon bit and the Indian sections are both really impressive and wouldn't look out of place in a world class theme park. And -",
          "I have been to a lots of zoos and I have to say that this zoo is up there with the best. I loved the fact that I could take photos of so many of the animals without having to take the shot through glass. The different themed areas work really well and I loved the Zambezi boat",
          "Spent the whole day around this fantastic, massive,well maintained zoo. I've been to the zoo in munster and this one dwarfs it. Animals seem to be well cared for and the whole place is so clean. All staff seem to be educated in the paticular animals they care for and friendly",
          "Visited the Zoo in early December to enjoy the Christmas Market, which was excellent, and much better than the other Christmas Markets scattered around Hannover town centre! Although small, the atmosphere around the various bars and stalls that were situated around the ice rink",
          "The Zoo is well-designed: classified animals according to continents : Africa, India, Canada....even toilets are built according to their districts. Interesting. The Zoo is not that big, half day is enough for young people or it is nice for family with kids to spend a day.",
          "Spent a wonderful afternoon here. Easy to get to, drive or just take the subway which stops right by the front entrance. Very easy to walk about everywhere and well designed layout. Has the whole range of animals from polar bears to gorillas, to tigers, to elephants, you name",
          "I love zoos. Have been to zoos all over North America and Europe. This is one of the very best and it isn't really given much notice in the guide books and reviews. Truly wonderful! Animals are depicted in more natural habitats often in with compatible animals. The animals",
          "The zoo in Hannover is devided into several so called \"worlds\" each with a theme/continent where you will find the animals living there. Most of the parts have been renovated since 2000 and they are still renovating to make it even better. I especially love the part called",
          "Set out with themed attractions such as the Yukon - a mine plus rocky water with merchant ship built in to it and with wave machine. showed off well the polar bear (saw only one who seemed happy enough) unlike Rhino (also only saw one) that exhibited some repetitive walking",
          "has all kinds of animals: Moneky house, zebras, giraffe, rhinos (difficult to spot), elephants, tiger, leopard, hippo, many birds. Excellent playing ground for children (jumping nets, climbing castle, etc.)",
          "The zoo is well kept and animals are not kept in cages but in enclosed spaces with a scenery mimicking their normal environment. We attended the shows which were interesting although we could not understand much given that everything was in German. The only annoying thing was",
          "This is a well- planned and set Zoo that offers a lot of interesting animals and activities for children in a nice setting. Like every Zoo in Germany , the topically arranged gastronomy is very expensive and no one can dodge the small snackbars; ICE AND TOFFEE STANDS with three",
          "I absolutely love the Hannover Zoo. It is more \"real\" than most other ones that I have visited over the years. There are several varieties of animals to see and they are not enclosed in small areas like other zoos that I have seen. I went to this zoo 4 times when I lived in",
          "A zoo visit is a must on any trip! This place is much better than others in Germany (like Bremerhaven) with a decent range of well looked after animals. The underwater world is nice, and the sea lions have a huge pool and wave machine - they really did look like they were having",
          "For anyone who likes zoos this is a must on your calendar when visiting Hanover. The zoo is beautifully laid out lots of sights and events for all ages. The large selection of animals and their surroundings are very interesting and cater for all interests, especially those of",
          "usually I go to ZOO with my child, this time we decided to go with friends and I was really surprised, the ZOO gave us a nice and interesting time even without children.",
          "I am not a big fan of the zoo concept, but kids needs must. I was impressed with this zoo, the care of the animals and the well designed enclosures for the animals on the eve in Dec it turns into a german market ,with stalls, ice rink, etc - very good",
          "This zoo is a must do in the city. Easy to arrive is a great plan with family or firends. The animals are beautiful and well care. It is a place to learn and know different species due to their great areas and information. The elephant\u00b4s area is amazing and also the tour by",
          "I spent 5 hours in the ZOO with my little sons and my mom. Everything is perfectly organized, animals have plenty of space and seem to be really well cared. I can imagine spending the whole day there, each part of the ZOO has a different topic that fully catches your attention,",
          "We went the last days of the winter season and it surprised us the wellness of most of the animals. In general they had big places to live in. A zoo designed for kids. Since the entrance doors this zoo is designed to allow the kids have a natural and a great experience.",
          "It's a must if you like animals and nature! Very well organized and the animals living in unter very good conditions,they care about them. The only \"bad\" thing, It says that it close at 18.00 but when we are visit at November, they start from 16.30 to close the animals in",
          "The Zoo is one of the best i have been to - including san diege - Leipzig & Hamburg - nearly none of the small cages from the early times of the \"Zoo Business\" is left over",
          "An extremely good zoo with lots of animals on show. The emphasis is on natural surroundings for the animals with best possible viewing. Feeding times and shows are well publicized and frequented. On the whole well worth a repeat visit several times a year. The winter zoo is a",
          "Zoo great loads of animals,places to eat quite reasonable and large,two could share. Shows and displays,nice little boat ride free included in entry price 20 euros,you can spend a full day.",
          "Spent the whole day at the zoo. Cost 25.00 to get in and I was expecting a normal zoo, I have never been so wrong, it has areas of the world that even look like where they ar supposed to be, in the first area Africa, there is a river with automatic boats that take you round and",
          "First of all its easy to get there. The zoo it self are so convenient to walk. There are no single of boring moment. The areas splits are absolutely grate. There's a lot of places to stop and eat . The fidding area is so fun for the young children. The only problem is that's the",
          "Spent the day here. Lots of different things to see and do. There is a boat that takes you around some of the exhibits. The Yukon Bay Area is great with the polar bears swimming. The American show is good but I won't spoil it by saying anymore!!",
          "It is quite an interesting place to visit. I must say, I wasn't in such an zoo and it looks really great. There are still some things to sort out, to renew or rebuild but all in all, a nice place. Only thing that remains bitter after visiting is the price. I understand that it",
          "Visited this zoo the other day and it is so good that my 4 yr old loved it. Much better then the zoo i been to in London my home town. The boat ride was wicked... I had to speed up my visit as we was driving back to england but i could of stayed there all day without my son",
          "When I was taking part in my German exchange, we decided to visit the zoo. I assumed that the animals are probably going to have a very limited amount of space, and it would most definitely much up to the London Zoo, however, I was proven wrong. The animals were treated with",
          "We visited family in Hildesheim for a week in August and on one of the days decided to visit Hannover Zoo, WOW. It's a fantastic zoo with lots to see and do, and the animals are obviously looked after very well, we were lucky enough to watch the feedings of the Polar Bear,",
          "Last December I had the opportunity to visit Hannover/Germany (I live in Las Vegas). One late afternoon my sister took me to the Hannover Winter Zoo (called Winter Zoo during that time of the year). I was questioning her mental health - who on earth wants to go in the dark at 27",
          "We really enjoyed in Hannover Zoo. Boat tour was perfect and the ticket price include it also. However, i couldn't see crocodiles. I will recommend everyone to visit this zoo when their Hannover visiting...",
          "A good sized zoo that's well laid out and with lots to see. The kids really enjoyed themselves. Already looking forward to our next visit.",
          "This zoo is well laid out, with many interesting animals. I really appreciated the many opportunities given to hear zoo keepers talk about the animals while feeding them. The sea lion show was also very good.",
          "Great experience! The animals seemed like well taken care of and they had plenty of room. Polar bear was my absolute favorite! Also the seal/eagle show was great!",
          "I was there on a solo business trip but I was just thinking how much better if I had the family with me. It's a nice well kept zoo, though I think some animals might be a bit shy or nocturnal animals - I couldn't find them in their closures. The small animal shows are pretty",
          "Not the largest zoo but very well designed and layer out. Great themed enclosures tho some could be bigger (orangatan's and big birds). There is a fun boat ride and great lay areas for the kids scattered throughout the park to keep the little ones entertained. Food areas clean,",
          "The zoo is very park-like...very nice to visit just for a walk. Animal enclosures simulate wild habitats. Interaction via feedings, etc. Downside is that the zoo is expensive for daytrippers.",
          "Hannover zoo is very nice. I visited the zoo with my friends. They have a large variety of animals and birds. It's good to go to the zoo if visiting Hannover.",
          "Very nice animal displays and a lovely park layout. Way too expensive. Only reason we went was because of a gift card we got.",
          "The exhibits were clean and well designed for the animal. Boat ride was nice. The animals were all active so they were fun to watch. All the signs are in German as were the shows. But you can get the gest of it.",
          "It is a wonderful zoo, the settings are marvellous even when not without mistake as the Siberian Tiger in the Indian setting or very short descriptions on the animals. In that, there are much better Zoos around. What, however is really impressive is the larger settings like the",
          "I travelled quite a distance to visit this zoo as I had heard it was supposed to show animals in their natural habits... If that's what you can call small areas just painted to look real. The fact that this zoo prides itself on giving the animals natural surroundings made it so",
          "Good for kids,family and small group from school. Not too large zoo park as space but it is full with kind of animal. The designer of the park is smart , he take benefit of all the space and produce a very lovely zoo. I visited it in 4 hours and I watched the shows of see life",
          "we have been planning on visiting this zoo for sometime already, we managed to visit this last weekend. the weather was okay, a bit rain shower in the morning but enough sun to keep it warm. we expected that it will be full on Sunday but its just enough crowd, no waiting queue",
          "I came with my girldfriend, because we read that it was a very nice zoo, and we hadn't been to one for a long time. The entry was 25\u20ac for adults, and in my opinion, it is expensive; otherwise the zoo is very clean and with a great variety of animals from different continents.",
          "We had looked at what to do whilst in Hannover and came across the zoo. Thought haven't been to a zoo for years so why not. We were not disappointed. The queue to get in wasn't too bad as it was still holiday time. We were given a guide in English which was good and vey helpful!",
          "I visited Hannover zoo twenty years ago and though it was special. I visited again this month (April 2015) and it blew my mind away. This is by far the best attraction I have been to in a long time. Don't be put off by the ticked price of \u20ac25. It's worth twice that. Their is",
          "We truly loved this zoo. It's quiet big, lots of different well known animals like lions, polar bears, giraffes, bisons, wolves buy also smaller animals like snakes and wombats. Highlight for us were the polar bears and the lions, lots of new borns as well!",
          "Best Zoo visited ever. We do not have kids but for us it was a complete surprise and an outstanding experience. For the first time I did not feel sorry for the animals, instead you are happy to know how much love and care is given to all of them by trying to have the most",
          "I visited with a party of school children & we were all very impressed. It has been designed exceptionally well. Thr facilities, even in February, were very good. The highlight was watching the polar bear dive into the water & swim - just incredible .",
          "We believe to know a fair bit about animal care and health. We also have 2 young animal loving children of 5 and 6 years. This is in both respects the best Zoo / animal park we have visited. It is fun for the kids, for more than one day. The animals are kept extremely well and",
          "I visited in winter which is challenging. But most of the amimals were out and about. The path layout makes sure you see everything. Summer would be the best time but it was a good use of an hour or two on a winters day. Easy to get there as the train stops right next to it.",
          "Visited with family in Dec 14. Fantastic experience. Elephant area and Yukon were highlights. Winter area was fantastic too (markets, ice skating, sledding etc.). would definitely recommend to families with young kids.",
          "yes, I know, that is quite a statement. And I am a regular visitor of Zoo's around the world. But when the world exhibition came to Hannover, they really remade this Zoo completely and it is great. They created artifical landscapes for the animals to live in. You have parts of",
          "I really like this Zoo. Good attractions, nice shows and setups. For kids it is a must. Prices are reasonable.",
          "Was a lovely zoo, great set up, variety was excellent not badly priced at all. And the trips and shows were very well run. The boats on river was brilliant",
          "I think this was one of the best ways to spend a day at Hannover! In the heart of the city (train 10) if I'm not wrong takes you to the Zoo! The animals have been kept well, fed on time, and they allow pets to visit as well!! Very clean and tidy, the maps guide you well inside",
          "The Hannover zoo is an amazing place. I was really impressed to see the animals kept in a near natural enclosure. The zoo map makes it very easy to locate the animals in a well arranged natural clusters like zanzibar, australia, india, underwater life and yukon bay. the",
          "Went to the zoo with mixed views as a zoo in a city sounds a bit strange. The price was very reasonable and so was the cost of activities/food. A really good selection of the big and small animals, all very easy to get up close to. The recreation of natural habitats was at times",
          "The Zoo is One of the Mixer Zoos i have visited, but the price is rather high. And even though they are trying to make the place ok for the animals, it still feels like it's not quite enough. But maybe that's just my opinion as I am not really a 'zoo person'. I am sure the kids",
          "The Hannover Zoo is not a classical Zoo with Animals in Cages, instead it is following the concept of an adventure Zoo. It is separated into different Continents. In Africa, you can take a tour with a boat and experience the animals in their environment. The new created Yukon",
          "I love Zoo's, and being a solo travellor (and not a very confident one!), I wanted something easy to do. The zoo was very short taxi ride from my hotel (Suite Novotel) and cost 8 euros. None of the entrance signs were in English which was a shame, so I joined a que and hoped",
          "The Berlin Zoo may be more famous, but it the Hannover Zoo is far superior. (Berlin Zoo looks like it hasn't changed in 60 years, with the traditional feeling of animals being imprisoned.) What we love about this zoo is the themed areas -- like Yukon Bay, which is brilliant.",
          "I went to several zoos in Germany but hannover zoo was the best especially with good weather that you could attend some live shows. I really recommend it however it is too expensive",
          "Just got back from visiting the Zoo it was a perfect stop over location on the way back from the in laws in Poland on the way to Europort to catch the ferry home. Arrived at opening time after a short walk from our hotel and it crossed my mind... Have I made a wise decision?",
          "One of the best zoos I've been to in this part of Europe. Very organized and easy to navigate. The highlights for us and our 7yo were: the boat ride, the Indian courtyard and the elephants, the polar bear, and the gorillas. The sea world show is nice even if the voiceover is",
          "Visited in June, was not crowded. Huge and very natural looking. Zambesi part was my favorite with the boat ride around. (Queues might be long in peak season.) Lots of exotic trees/bushes/flowers. Also the polar bear/seal/pinguin area was very natural. Feedings/shows are several",
          "this is one of the greatest places to be seen in Hannover , it is really fantastic area to see such kind of different animales , clean natural area , very good planned area for such kind of zoo , as it was between large forest and clean green area , clean oxygenated air ,",
          "The Hannover Zoo is a great place to visit when in Hannover with children but not only. Great attractions nice arrangements, all in all a fun day out for the kids and adults alike. The boat ride is very nice and the fact that you can at times get really close to the animals,",
          "Hannover Zoo is a fantastic day-trip for the whole family. The zoo itself is dedicated to keeping their animals happy and stimulated, and their main aim is to educate their visitors about the animals that they house. Each exhibit is expertly suited to the animal it contains,",
          "One of the best zoos that I have visited. The boat ride was very relaxing. Good choice on a sunny day and reasonably priced.",
          "Ok didn't go in. Should have checked prices before travelling there. 25 Euros per adult means that this zoo is for adults with lots of spare money. Not me then!",
          "It have lots of activities. The show of the penguin and also the restaurant was awesome. I will recommend that to anyone that have kids.",
          "Whoever designed this zoo deserves a medal - it's absolutely amazing. Rather than having the 'typical' zoo feel with a lot of enclosures in metal / concrete, there are different zones in the zoo and each zone has been designed amazingly well so that you really feel you are in",
          "Turning mid winter, on a shower ridden afternoon we were worried, but should not have been as town zoos go this is by far the nicest I have been to. Split into zones there was plenty to keep us occupied for 4hrs. The animals look well looked after, the surrounding are amazing",
          "The Polar Bears are great and the fact that they allow dog into the zoo makes it interesting as the big cats want to eat them. The elephants were great, attempting to move a massive balls over a log. It showed how clever they were and how persistent, not that the poor elephant",
          "We are holders of annual tickets and are regular visitors every time we are surprised by something great place to visit.",
          "On a weekend visit to Hannover decided on a trip to the zoo. I was expecting a small concrete place as you find with a lot of small urban zoos. I could not have been more wrong!!!! It was amazing. Although small, it takes less than an hour to walk round the whole place, the",
          "When travelling to visit my military boyfriend in Hannover, we had nothing to do one Sunday and as most things are closed, we decided to take a trip to the zoo. I wasn't expecting a lot. Usually inner city zoos lack charm and personality but this was something else! We went",
          "Went to the zoo on a cold November day. Was pretty kicked to catch a lot of animals up close, due to the Plexiglas viewing windows. However the polar bears were not there :( Big bummer! In-fact the whole arctic section was closed off. I as an Indian, loved the huge section",
          "The zoo is one of Hannovers main attractions. We really enjoyed the ambience and the many animals around.",
          "Amazing Zoo or better to say more like a Theme Park with the different sections which reflect different parts of the world. In Summer the river tour is great fun and in Winter the Xmas Market is a nice place to have a Gluehwein.",
          "We visited this lovely zoo on 27th November 2013. It was a cold but dry day and we fully understand the limitations of visiting a zoo in the middle of winter as many of the animals are kept indoors for obvious reasons. Our visit was during refurbishment work of the polar bears",
          "I was in the Zoo Hannover several times as couple and also with 2 children. It is always an interesting experience... especially for kids.",
          "Very beautiful area, a little expensiv. The presentation of animals is excellent. Play areas for enfants and toddlers.",
          "Don't expect to see a vast array of species, but the ones here are amazing, in fantastic surroundings. The Zoo is broken up into different zones, with features abound. For example, the elephant enclosure is superb, with lots of space for the animals and surroundings that make",
          "Great settings for the animals. For example, the elephants live in an old Indian temple and the polar bears live in an old abandoned Yukon whaling station. They use plexiglass to great effect at this zoo so you really can get remarkably close to the animals. Strange that they",
          "My brother and I visited this zoo on our trip to Germany recently and quiet enjoyed it, I especially liked the themed areas the zoo has, for example putting the polar region animals in the Yukon Bay Area, and the boat ride through the African experience, it's an easy zoo to",
          "I love this zoo - I have visited it 4-5 times. They have done an amazing job of the exhibits - the food is a little pricy but to be expected within a zoo.",
          "This zoo was fabulous for kids. It had about 20 separate areas. tree house, eating areas, trampolines, grasslands and parks and that is over and above the animals! There was a great boat ride through the Africa part of the zoo. We also really liked that the zoo aimed to add",
          "Interesting deco of enclosures surrounded by lovely forest. Zoo keepers well versed and knowledgeable and important to support places that look after the animals well.",
          "A zoo that is small enough not to get bored but big enough to have a good selection of animals. Animals look well cared for and appear to have adequate space. Loved the Polar bears and Meercats. I thought it was good value at 25 eoros for an adult. Did not have the food so",
          "a must see when in Hannover, can bee done in 4 hours, but I recomend to use a day if weather is good, lots of shows and great for kids.",
          "It hav, by far, the best infrastructure, the animals are in large enough spaces, and the tematic zones are briliantly prepared. Pure AWSOMNESS :)",
          "Went to this zoo a few months back for the afternoon. Easy to get too and really good value for money. We loved going into the petting zoo and picking up the goats (inner child in me) and the zoo was really easy to get around. I can imagine its a great place to take the family",
          "Well laid out, lots of shows and things to do, a good day out for all the family, although a touch expensive when compared to places like London Zoo",
          "This zoo was brilliant and is well worth a visit. We spent the whole day here and there was lots to do. The food was of a very good standard and not to expensive. The 7 different zones were well thought out and very well designed even down to the toilets. All the animals looked",
          "I suppose as zoos go, it is worthvisiting for a day out for want of anything better to do with kids in Hanover. II am not a particular fan of zoos, so my review is biased. However, kids really enjoy the water ride, Yukon, and proximity to the animals. the shop is also quite",
          "This is a wonderful Zoo with or without children so much to see and do. The boat trip is well worth the wait in the queue. The Yukon are is quite spectacular.",
          "This is probably the best zoo I have visited. It is quite expensive (25 euro each) but we spent about 6 hours here and I would say it is worth the price. It is divided into different areas (Australia, Yukon etc) and each of them has been brilliantly designed and landscaped.",
          "I have now visited this zoo 3 times. It's great, particularly the polar bear exhibit and the elephants. There are lots of places to eat which are all very reasonably priced. A great day out, well worth every penny.",
          "This zoo has loads of really exciting animals. My particular favourite were the elephants but the big cats, polar bears, monkeys, wolves seals and the Zambezi river tour. Although they did put penguins in the \"Yukon Bay\" which isn't exactly geographically correct... All the",
          "Despite the small size zoo there some great attraction such as a couple of days old baby giraffe...Really nice , the seals, and the white panthers jumping around.",
          "I have 4 kids of varying ages and seem to hit so many zoos over the years wherever we go. This is by far the best zoo ever so far. Other zoos in the area fall away under this blaze of glory. Ok so the food drink and souvenirs are expensive but that's seems quite normal for",
          "It was very nice with all the snow. There was also a sleigh-track for free for the kids. Easy to reach with one of the buses/trams. There is also a cafeteria where you can order all sorts of different fast foods, although a bit pricey, not nor more than you would pay at any",
          "This is the best zoo which I visited; the zoo is a little bit out from Hannover but it worth to see it. when you step in you are like the middle of a jungle. You don't have the feeling that those wild animals are not at home. I saw pelicans unleashed, jumping on alley - really",
          "We spent a day with our kids three years ago and they were so amazed that we had to visit again. The zoo is very well equipped, clean, the animals look healthy and the food quality and price is reasonable. On the flip side, do not expect extremely rare animals. All the",
          "the 2nd to visit in Germany , and finally we found elephants , It is very nice place not huge but a good place to spend your day .The atmosphere of the adventure and the travel from place to place is a very nice idea.",
          "So many varieties of species and i was fortunate to have good weather on the same day. Never seen Lion and zebras in the same enclosure as they kept here. It\u2019s good one time experience to visit (of course quite costly)",
          "There is no denying that a lot of money, time and effort has gone in to this zoo and it is beautifully thought out and executed. The best example of this is yukon bay! This place is spectacular and i highly recommend buying the documentary dvd which explains how it was built!",
          "I visited the zoo with a group of friends and this was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. There is a lot to see and the animals look really well taken care of and most of them have a lot of space to roam around. The lay out and design of the zoo is also very",
          "I love coming here, loads of places for the kids to play and the animals seem happy, and bonus you can take you dog on the premises too.",
          "Really nice and interactive. It gives the impression that the most of the animals are not so much contrained. Perfect for families with kids",
          "This has by far been one of my favourite zoo's ever. It has little sections for every area of the world and they have so many different and interesting animals there :) my favourite part was by far the polar bears because they are just so cute and they always put on a little",
          "This Zoo is amazing even in winter. Kids had so much fun iceskating and sledging. Really good entertainment for the whole family.",
          "Honestly, this was one of the highlights of my many trips to europe. If you are in Germany...somehow tyou have to put on your itinerary to go to Hannover Zoo. It is so well made and so many creative ideas. it has such a great relaxed vibe and so much fun. Perfect place to see",
          "We have loved going to the Zoo since our children were 3 and 5. They play in the sand and on the amazing playground. They are safe and entertained while my friends and I have coffee. Also my husband meets us for dinner sometimes and we have quality family time. Best value",
          "Price seems high at the beginning but you get a lot to see for it. I saw many mothers with maybe 2 year old kids who even had a 1-year-pass.",
          "Just spent an amazing day at Hannover zoo. A bit like a theme park with animals instead of rides! The detail in the Sambesi & Yukon areas is first class!! There are plenty of extras to keep the children entertained if looking at animals is not enough. I wanted to have a go at",
          "A great day to spend a bank holiday. The general layout was extremely interesting but having previously been informed that the zoo had recently been updated, expectations were high. However some areas were disappointing though the children's play areas exceeded all",
          "Although not the caliber of the San Diego Zoo, this zoo surprised me in its layout, health of animals, environment and cleanliness. I generally don't have high expectations of certain european amusement attractions, such as zoos, amusement parks, aquariums, etc, as I'm",
          "The zoo is situated at the end of the tram line at the wonderfully titled Zoo terminus! The zoo itself is large yet has an enclosed friendly feel aboout it. The animals on view were wide ranging and in excellent condition. Numerous species had babies, always a good sign. The",
          "It is literally the best place I have ever visited in my entire life! I kid you not, I have never been more pleased with an attraction, ever. The setting is incredible; the attention to detail is outstanding and the Seal performance is brilliant, (despite being in German). Even",
          "I've been to several zoos across Europe and I can say the one in Hannover is one of the poorest (except one in Slovakia). The best zoo in Europe for me remains the one in Barcelona. Pros: - lots of animals - the giraffes and the lions have a good output ... you can barely",
          "The Hannover Zoo advertises itself as a adventure zoo and it almost is that. There is indeed a lot of action going on. As such I can recommend e.g. some animal feeding sessions, Dr. Zoolittle, or the seal show. There you can have a real eagle flying just an inch above your head",
          "I must admit that this is one of the best zoos in Europe. You can roam around and have a glance on inumerous animals. I have been to several zoos but this one is a special one. You must not miss it. Off course there no penguins.",
          "One of the best zoos we have ever visited - go and enjoy",
          "Good place for young and old to while away a few hours, one of the best zoos in Europe.",
          "We visited in December 2011 which was when they were doing the 'Winter Zoo' and it was a great experience. They had most of the usual animals to see (apart from a few that can't handle the cold) and also turned the central area into a winter wonderland with a large ice skating",
          "Distinct geographic areas are nicely arranged. All kind of different animals. Great 'expedition' canoe ride. And when you are tired, you can enjoy good food. Plenty of pay parking. Excellent public transportation access. ATM by the door. Only negative experience is that they",
          "We were invited here as guests and were well taken care of. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was good. We had a good long night here and the hours just flew past. Can't wait to visit again",
          "Clearly the animls here are well looked after and happy, with there lives enriched by many additions. The layout and presentation of the zoo is well thought out and the buildings/ surroundings very well selected",
          "This is a very nice zoo, even in wintertime. The different theme's are very nice. There where some animals we could not see, because they where inside. The food was not expensive and very tasty.",
          "Zoo Hannover is one of the best zoos I have visited in the last years. Recently renovated it has a beautiful area called yukon bay which looks exactly like you would walk through Canada. The animals look to feel comfortable and it looks like they would be in their natural",
          "Had a fantastic day @ Erlebenis Zoo. As i visited in January a lot of the animals had a been moved inside due to the cold temperatures and the river cruise through the zoo wasn't running but this didn't detract from the experience. Highlights include the Sloths and Orangutans",
          "Having been to many zoos around the world this one was clearly the best I have been to iin my life. And the most expensive, but fully worth the money. More than enough pparkin places to start with lots of cashier boxes so no waiting times there, the staff there pretty helpful",
          "An ever changing great places for kids and adults alike. A must do and they have cool food for the kids.",
          "From start to finish the day was amazing. All the animals unlike other zoos I have visited were all grouped together as they would be in the wild. To start with we went around the african animals, helped by the small boat trip around the animals. getting so close to the",
          "The name of the zoo, \"Erlebnis Zoo Hannover\" is quite correct. This zoo really is an experience. There are a number of themed areas ranging from the Meyers farm. depicting farm life in Lower Saxony before the war, and including a really good restaraunt with local foods, to the",
          "Nice zoo, but not fabulous. Some parts of the zoo are really outdated and we felt flat-out sorry for the primates that were trapped in a Soviet-style bunker. The newer areas are very nice and impressive though. I felt the zoo did not live up to the hype, but is definately worth",
          "My kids and I love this place! It really has a lot to offer - a boat ride to see the African animals, cool exhibits, and always unique fun things for the kids to do along the way. The bathrooms were nice - all themed according to their area. Tip - don't eat at the African",
          "This Zoo is for sure the place to be, either Winter or Summer. If you are a child, adult or grandparents, this place is something for everyone! A must do in Hanover!",
          "Young pieople will enjoy this zoo. In particular the general way the zoo is arranged makes it very convienient for older people as well as for strollers. Pick a nice day when the sun is shining and you won't be disappointed."

        "wiki": "World Trade Center is a terminal station on the PATH system, within the World Trade Center complex in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It is served by the Newark\u2013World Trade Center line on weekdays and holiday weekends, as well as by the Hoboken\u2013World Trade Center line on weekdays, and is the eastern terminus of both.\nThe World Trade Center station is located near the site of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&M)'s Hudson Terminal, which opened on July 19, 1909. In 1961, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bought the bankrupt H&M system, rebranded it as PATH, and redeveloped Hudson Terminal as part of the World Trade Center. As part of the construction of the World Trade Center, Hudson Terminal was torn down, replaced with the World Trade Center station, and re-opened on July 6, 1971. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, a temporary station opened in 2003 while the World Trade Center complex was being rebuilt. Work on a permanent station building commenced in 2008. The main station house, the Oculus, opened on March 3, 2016, and the terminal was renamed the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, or \"World Trade Center\" for short.\nThe World Trade Center station has five tracks (three for Hoboken-bound trains, two for Newark-bound trains) and four platforms in the middle of a turning loop. Trains from New Jersey use the loop to turn around and head back to New Jersey. The platforms are located four floors below ground level. The floor immediately above the platforms is occupied by the station's fare mezzanine. The New York City Subway's WTC Cortlandt station is adjacent to and above the mezzanine.\nThe $4 billion Oculus station house, designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, consists of white ribs that interlock high above the ground. The interior of the station house contains two underground floors, which house part of the Westfield World Trade Center mall. The transportation hub connects the various modes of transportation in Lower Manhattan, from the Fulton Center in the east to the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal in the west, through the station house. The hub contains connections to various New York City Subway stations, including Chambers Street\u2013World Trade Center/Park Place/Cortlandt Street on the 2, \u200b3\u200b, A, \u200bC, \u200bE\u200b, \u200bN, \u200bR, and \u200bW trains and WTC Cortlandt on the 1 train. It is the fifth-busiest transportation hub in the New York metropolitan area.\nThe Westfield World Trade Center mall is also within the Oculus building. The new station has received mixed reviews: although the hub has been praised for its design, it has also been criticized for its high costs and extended delays.\n\n\n== Station layout ==\nThe station has five tracks served by three island platforms and one side platform in a basement four stories underground. Platform A, next to tracks 1 and 2, opened as part of the Transportation Hub on February 25, 2014. Platform B between tracks 2 and 3 opened on May 7, 2015. The other two platforms opened on September 8, 2016.Above the station, there are three mezzanine levels. The top two levels contain shops as part of the Westfield World Trade Center. The first mezzanine level below ground also contains the Cortlandt Street\u2013Greenwich Street station for the 1 train and a direct entrance to the northbound platform. A connection to the Cortlandt Street\u2013Church Street station's southbound platform, for the N, \u200bR, and \u200bW trains, is located at the far east end of the mezzanine, past the mall's shops. The second mezzanine level contains the entrances to the station, as well as more connections to the subway. The third mezzanine level, located directly above the platform, contains the fare control and access to the platforms.Prior to reconstruction, station had a temporary entrance on Church Street, which opened along with the rest of the temporary station in November 2003. With the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site, the entrances and size of the temporary station have changed over time. In 2007, the Church Street entrance was relocated to the south, and the old entrance was closed and demolished. In April 2008, a third and final temporary entrance to the station was located at Vesey Street, facing Greenwich Street and adjacent to 7 World Trade Center. The temporary entrance was a one-story building on the south side of Vesey Street. On March 3, 2016, the permanent PATH station building opened and the temporary entrance was closed. The former temporary entrance was demolished later that year to make way for the Performing Arts Center.A connection to Brookfield Place opened on October 27, 2013, through a permanent passageway known as the West Concourse.  On August 16, 2016, the Westfield World Trade Center entrance opened. To accommodate repairs to the Downtown Hudson Tubes, service on the Newark\u2013World Trade Center line between Exchange Place and World Trade Center was suspended during almost all weekends in 2019 and 2020, except on holiday weekends.\n\n\n== Hudson Terminal ==\n\nHudson Terminal was built by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad at the beginning of the twentieth century and was located between Greenwich, Cortlandt, Church, and Fulton Streets. The Hudson Terminal included two 22-story office buildings located above the station.The terminal was designed with ramps to allow pedestrian traffic to flow in and out of the station quickly and easily. The station was served by two single-track tubes connected by a loop to speed train movements. The loop included five tracks and 3 platforms (2 center island and one side) and was somewhat similar to the current arrangement. By 1914, passenger volume at the Hudson Terminal had reached 30,535,500 annually. Volume nearly doubled by 1922, with 59,221,354 passengers that year.Overall ridership on the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad declined substantially from a high of 113 million riders in 1927 to 26 million in 1958, after new automobile tunnels and bridges opened across the Hudson River. The H&M went bankrupt in 1954. The State of New Jersey was interested in getting the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to take over the railroad, but the Port Authority long viewed it as something unprofitable and had no interest in doing so.Then, in the late 1950s, the Port Authority proposed to build a \"world trade center\" in Lower Manhattan along the East River. Since the Port Authority was a bi-state agency covering both New Jersey and New York, its projects required approval from both states. Toward the end of 1961, negotiations with outgoing New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner stalled, precluding the Port Authority from starting construction on the World Trade Center. In December 1961, Port Authority executive director Austin J. Tobin met with newly elected New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes, and made a proposal to shift the World Trade Center project to the west side, where the Hudson Terminal was located. In exchange, the Port Authority would take  control of the H&M.In acquiring the H&M Railroad, the Port Authority also acquired the Hudson Terminal and other buildings which were deemed obsolete. On January 22, 1962, the two states reached an agreement to allow the Port Authority to take over the railroad and build the World Trade Center on Manhattan's lower west side. As part of the terms of the agreement, the H&M railroad was renamed Port Authority Trans-Hudson, or PATH for short.\n\n\n== Old PATH stations ==\n\n\n=== Original PATH station ===\n\nGroundbreaking on the World Trade Center took place in 1966. The site was on land fill, with bedrock located 213 feet (65 m) below the surface. A new method was used to construct a slurry wall to keep out water from the Hudson River. During excavation of the site and construction of the towers, the original Hudson Tubes remained in service as elevated tunnels. The new station cost $35 million to build. At the time, it had a passenger volume of 85,000 daily.The Hudson Terminal was closed when the new PATH station opened on July 6, 1971, west of the original terminal. Larger balloon loops in the PATH station platform allowed 10-car trains; the previous station with its tight loops could only handle trains of up to 6 cars.  When the station opened, it had nine high-speed escalators between the platform level and the mezzanine level. The WTC PATH station was served by Newark\u2013World Trade Center and Hoboken\u2013World Trade Center trains. The station was connected to the World Trade Center towers via an underground concourse and a shopping center. There were also underground connections to the New York City Subway (A, \u200bC, and \u200bE trains at World Trade Center, and N, \u200bR, and \u200bW trains at Cortlandt Street\u2013Church Street). By 2001, the volume of passengers using the WTC PATH station was approximately 25,000 daily. While the construction of the World Trade Center neared completion, a temporary corridor was provided to take passengers between the station and a temporary entrance on Church Street.The station sustained minor damage during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; a section of ceiling in the station collapsed and trapped dozens. Within a week, the Port Authority was able to resume PATH service to the World Trade Center.The station was closed on September 11, 2001, after American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m.. In the minutes afterward, three PATH trains pulled into the station. One had arrived from Newark and two others from Hoboken. The first Hoboken train turned around without stopping, not letting off passengers or opening any doors. The second Hoboken train arrived on track 3 at 8:52 a.m. and was ordered to be evacuated, employees included; the train never left the World Trade Center complex and was found during the 9/11 recovery process. A train from Newark came into the terminal at 8:55 a.m. and stopped only to pick up passengers. After United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower at 9:03 a.m., dispatchers ordered the closure of the Exchange Place and World Trade Center stations; the former was closed due to severe water damage.  A fourth train was sent to the station at 9:10 a.m. to pick up a dozen PATH employees and a homeless individual, leaving the station empty. The station was subsequently destroyed during the collapse of the World Trade Center.\n\n\n=== Temporary PATH station ===\n\nWith the station destroyed, service to Lower Manhattan was suspended for over two years. Exchange Place, the next station on the Newark\u2013World Trade Center line, also had to be closed because it could not operate as a terminal station. Instead, two uptown services (Newark\u201333rd Street, red on the official PATH map; and Hoboken\u201333rd Street, blue on the map) and one intrastate New Jersey service (Hoboken\u2013Journal Square, green on the map) were put into operation. Cleanup of the Exchange Place station was needed after the attacks. In addition, the downtown Hudson tubes had been flooded, which destroyed the track infrastructure. Modifications to the tracks were also required since the Exchange Place station was not a terminal station. The uptown PATH tubes, ferry routes, and NJ Transit lines across the Hudson River could not handle the displaced ridership on their own, and it was deemed necessary to rebuild the World Trade Center terminal. After the reconfiguration of the Exchange Place station was completed, it was reopened to PATH trains on June 29, 2003. The setup was temporary: passengers at Exchange Place would transfer to ferries to Lower Manhattan until the World Trade Center station could be reopened later that year.PATH service to Lower Manhattan was restored when a temporary station opened on November 23, 2003. The inaugural train was the same one that had been used for the evacuation. The temporary PATH station was designed by Port Authority chief architect Robert I. Davidson and constructed at a cost of $323 million. It was located at the same place as the original station. The station featured a canopy entrance along Church Street and a 118-by-12-foot (36 by 3.7 m) mosaic mural, \"Iridescent Lightning,\" by Giulio Candussio of the Scuola Mosaicisti del Friuli in Spilimbergo, Italy. The station was also adorned with opaque panel walls inscribed with inspirational quotes attesting to the greatness and resilience of New York City. These panels partially shielded the World Trade Center site from view.Some sections of the station, including the passageway and the signage on the northeast corner, were only lightly damaged on September 11, 2001, during the collapse of the World Trade Center. These sections of the station were retained in the temporary station, and remained in the new station. Following its reopening and the resumption of Newark\u2013World Trade Center and Hoboken\u2013World Trade Center services, the station quickly reclaimed its status as the busiest station in the PATH system. However, it had several limitations. The temporary station had 8-car-long platforms, whereas the original station had 10-car-long platforms. The station frame was also not strong enough to support development above it, and parts of the station were located outdoors in the \"bathtub\". The temporary station had only one entrance, at Church Street, and disabled patrons needed to take four elevators to go from street level to platform level.The station was also home to a StoryCorps booth, which opened in 2005. Through this program, visitors could arrange to give oral recorded histories of the disaster. The booth closed in the spring of 2007 to make way for construction at the World Trade Center site. In June 2007, the street entrance to the temporary station was closed and demolished as part of the site construction. A set of new staircases was constructed several feet to the south, and a \"tent\" structure was added to provide cover from the elements. The tent structure, by Voorsanger Architects and installed at a cost of $275,000, was designed to have an \"aspiring quality,\" according to architect Bartholomew Voorsanger. That entrance on Church Street was closed in April 2008 when the entrance was relocated once again. On April 1, 2008, the third temporary entrance to the PATH station opened for commuters. The entrance was located on Vesey Street, adjacent to 7 World Trade Center. It was demolished with the opening of the permanent Calatrava-designed station, since it was on the site of the future Performing Arts Center.\n\n\n== World Trade Center Transportation Hub ==\n\nThe World Trade Center Transportation Hub is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's formal name for the new PATH station and the associated transit and retail complex that opened on March 3, 2016. The station's renaming took place when the station reopened. It was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and composed of a train station with a large and open mezzanine under the National September 11 Memorial plaza. This mezzanine is connected to an aboveground head house structure called the Oculus\u2014located between 2 World Trade Center and 3 World Trade Center\u2014as well as to public concourses under the various towers in the World Trade Center complex.\n\nIn addition, the station was designed to connect the PATH to the New York City Subway system, and to facilitate a below ground east\u2013west passageway that connects to the various modes of transportation in Lower Manhattan, from the Fulton Center to the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal. Furthermore, to replace the lost retail space from the original mall at the World Trade Center, significant portions of the Hub are devoted to the new 365,000 square feet (33,900 m2) Westfield World Trade Center mall.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAfter the September 11 attacks, officials proposed a $7 billion redesign of transit in Lower Manhattan. This included a new PATH terminal, the Fulton Center, the South Ferry/Whitehall Street terminal further downtown, and the reconstruction of the West Side Highway. Other development projects to restart Lower Manhattan's economy were also proposed, and a new PATH terminal was seen as instrumental in making this happen. In August 2002, the U.S. government allocated $4.5 billion to build a terminal linking the subway and PATH stations at the World Trade Center site. Four locations were considered,  and it was ultimately decided to build the new terminal four levels underground, along the base of the World Trade Center \"bathtub\".A large transit station was not part of the 2003 Memory Foundations master plan for the site by Daniel Libeskind, which called for a smaller station along the lines of the original subterranean station that existed beneath the World Trade Center. Libeskind's design proposed that the current station house's site be left as an open plaza, forming a \"Wedge of Light\" so that sun rays around the autumnal equinox would hit the World Trade Center footprints each September. The plaza would have included a wedge whose lines showed the sun's rays at 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. on September 11 of each year. These times respectively represented when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower and when it collapsed.\n\n\n=== Redesign ===\n\nIn early 2004, the Port Authority, which owns the land, modified the Libeskind plan to include a large transportation station downtown, intended to rival Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal. Calatrava was hired as the architect for this new, $2 billion design, and he revealed his plan in January 2004. Calatrava's design called for an above-ground station house (now the Oculus) with curved supports that extended outward, like wings. These wings would run the length of the concourse, which would run from Church Street in the east to the PATH station under Greenwich Street in the west. The building itself would be located on its own block, bounded clockwise from the north by Fulton, Church, Dey, and Greenwich Streets.A skylight would run the length of the station building. The roof was originally designed to mechanically open to increase light and ventilation to the enclosed space. In a nod to the Libeskind concept, the Oculus was built to maximize the effect of the autumnal equinox rays (coinciding with the skylight opening on or around September 11 every year). On the actual anniversary of the attacks, the skylight would open for 102 minutes to commemorate the duration between the time the first tower was hit and the collapse of the second tower. If needed, the skylight could also be manually opened to provide air ventilation.As outlined in the reconstruction plan, the new terminal would be rebuilt in several stages. The first phase would include the construction of a temporary northern entrance, which would be open between 2005 and 2006. The second phase would entail the construction of an East-West Concourse under the West Side Highway, connecting to the World Financial Center (now Brookfield Place). The third phase would include temporary structural underpinning for a temporary platform and track, as well as the construction of Platform D, the first permanent platform. The fourth phase would consist of the lengthening of the other three platforms, expansion of the mezzanine, and structural completion, while the fifth phase would include the construction of the station house. The complex would be completed by 2009 or 2010 under this plan.The station design received critical acclaim. In 2004, Herbert Muschamp, architecture critic for The New York Times, compared the design to the Bethesda Terrace and Fountain in Central Park. He congratulated the Port Authority for hiring Calatrava, and predicted that the new station would be able to impact the city's future. Muschamp continued that the architect's vision \"should satisfy those who believe that buildings planned for ground zero must aspire to a spiritual dimension.\" Another New York Times critic, Michael Kimmelman, wrote that the PATH hub was appropriate for the World Trade Center site, as it would be \"a major cultural contribution\" to the New York City skyline. A committee for Manhattan Community Board 1 called the station design \"beautiful\" in 2005.Calatrava described the original design as representative of \"a bird being released from a child's hand\". However, Calatrava's original soaring spike design was scaled back because of security issues. The New York Times observed in 2005 that the \"bird has grown a beak\", and that because of the new security features, the station might \"now evoke a slender stegosaurus more than it does a bird\". The design was further modified in 2008 to eliminate the opening and closing roof mechanism because of budget and space constraints.A Curbed NY reporter wrote in 2015, \"The platform's mezzanine level ... is kind of amazing and shows off the station's soaring ribbed structure\", but other reviews derided the station redesign as being more gaudy than utilitarian. In 2014, Benjamin Kabak, a blogger writing for The Atlantic's CityLab, criticized the emphasis placed on form over function, citing design flaws driven by aesthetic choices that detract from the station's usability as a transit hub. He stated that the staircases could not accommodate the number of passengers using the station during rush hours, and that any leaks caused the marble floors to become slippery. Kabak also said that \"the PATH Hub is shaping up to be an example of design divorced from purpose.\" Steve Cuozzo of the New York Post described the station in 2014 as it was being built as \"a self-indulgent monstrosity\" and \"a hideous waste of public money\". Michael Kimmelman, architecture critic for The New York Times, referred to the structure as \"a kitsch stegosaurus\". In 2015, as the station neared completion, New York magazine referred to the hub as a \"Glorious Boondoggle\" and, while withholding final judgement on the unfinished structure, did note the \"Jurassic\" appearance. When the station opened in 2016, the New York Post editorial board called the hub the \"world's most obscenely overpriced commuter rail station \u2014 and possibly its ugliest\", deeming the transit hub a \"white elephant\" and \"monstrosity\", comparing the Oculus to a \"giant gray-white space insect\".\n\n\n==== West Concourse ====\n\nA 600-foot (180 m) pedestrian underpass under the West Side Highway, referred to as the West Concourse and formerly as the East-West Connector, links the WTC station mezzanine with Brookfield Place in Battery Park City, on the west side of the World Trade Center. It contains stores as part of Westfield World Trade Center. The concourse itself opened on October 23, 2013. Access to One World Trade Center from the West Concourse became possible for employees when the tower opened on November 3, 2014. On May 29, 2015, the same day the tower's observatory opened, the entrance to the observation deck opened. The concourse cost $225 million to build, and has been described as the most expensive passageway in the world.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nConstruction of the Oculus called for relocation of the World Trade Center cross in April 2006. However, the Oculus's construction did not begin in earnest until July 8, 2008, when the first prefabricated \"ribs\" for the pedestrian walkway under Fulton Street were installed on the site. The mezzanine level of the station was undergoing major construction and work on the foundation was underway. By March 2011, over 225 of the 300 steel pieces that make up the roof of the station were installed. Later that month installation of the Vierendeel Truss, one of the hub's key components, began with the installation of a 50 short tons (45 long tons) section of the 271-short-ton (242-long-ton) truss. The truss serves as the mezzanine roof and also acts as a support for the northeast corner of the WTC Memorial.\n\nThe Oculus's $542 million construction contract was awarded to Skanska in summer 2010. The project included steel erection for the substructure; construction connecting to the Vehicular Security Center; the Greenwich Street corridor and the steel and concrete placing under the 1 train's subway box; and preparations for installation of east arch truss. By June 2013, ten pieces of exterior arches were installed for the Oculus. The initial construction was expected to conclude at the end of 2014 or beginning of 2015, and the internal construction such as paint, turnstiles, and ticket booths, was expected to complete in the end of 2015, with an official opening scheduled for December 17, 2015. On October 23, 2013, the West Concourse opened with access to the World Financial Center, now renamed the Brookfield Place. The storefronts were covered and not yet opened, and the second floor was still closed for construction of One World Trade Center.On February 25, 2014, half of the first platform of the new station, Platform A, was opened to the public with service to Hoboken. The new platform, an island platform, was fully modernized and contains new lighting, speakers, illuminated signs, escalators and elevators. The west side of the platform was walled off at the time. On November 3, One World Trade Center opened, as did the PATH entrance from that building. Eight days later, the Fulton Center and Dey Street Concourse opened to the public. The Dey Street Concourse entrance into the Transportation Hub was closed until the Hub opened. On November 22, the last of 114 rafters was installed. Also by this date, one crane had been disassembled and painting of the hub continued.On May 7, 2015, Platform B and the remaining half of Platform A opened, and Platform C closed. A few weeks later on May 29, the entrance to the observation deck in the West Concourse was opened on the same day One World Observatory also opened. In late September, the temporary new West Walkway opened with access from the platforms to the West Concourse.\n\n\n=== Cost and delays ===\nThe Transportation Hub has been described as either one of the world's most expensive train stations, or the world's single most expensive station, for its massive reconstruction cost of approximately $4 billion. By contrast, the proposed 2-mile (3.2 km) extension of the Newark\u2013World Trade Center PATH service to Newark Liberty International Airport is projected to cost $1.5 billion. The hub was also criticized for its delays, as the hub was completed almost 10 years later than originally projected. However, even the original cost projections for the hub were high, as the original proposal was projected to cost almost $2 billion. The high cost for a single station is attributed to the extravagant design, which stems from the Port Authority needing to convince the government of New Jersey to pay for a project situated entirely in New York.Originally, the reconstruction was to be funded by the Federal Transit Administration, which gave approximately $1.9 billion to the project. The costs of the hub were still expensive, but it was to be finished at budget in 2009. In 2014 dollars, the cost of the hub was estimated at $4 billion. The hub cost twice as much in 2014 as it should have originally cost in 2004. The West Concourse cost $225 million and was billed as the \"world's most expensive hallway\". Construction, maintenance, and management alone cost $635 million; the Port Authority awarded several subcontracts, most of them costly. The fees of the main construction team took up almost a billion dollars, and utility installation around the entire World Trade Center site cost another $400 million. Over $500 million in cost savings was overlooked.\n\nThe design was costly, with Calatrava netting $80 million in design fees and the overall architectural design being another $405.8 million. Speeding up the pace of construction also contributed to the higher cost, with $100 million dedicated to building the National September 11 Memorial & Museum and another $24 million to speed up delivery of construction materials. The price of the station was further driven up by Calatrava's architectural decisions.  He wanted to import custom-made steel from a northern Italian factory, which cost $474 million, and have a columnless, aesthetically based design; skylights in the ground, instead of trees; and large, soaring \"wings\", or rafters. Another $335 million was added to the cost overrun because the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had to build around the New York City Subway's IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line (carrying the 1 train), since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority refused to close the line for fear of inconveniencing commuters from Staten Island taking the Staten Island Ferry. The line had to be supported on a bridge over the station instead of on columns through the station. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy damaged several hundred million dollars worth of materials. Some of the additional cost and delay was due to additions and modifications to the original plan by the Port Authority. Calatrava's original entry pavilion was scaled back for security reasons, for instance.The hub's skyrocketing costs also attracted much controversy. An editor at The New York Times wrote that \"Mr. Calatrava is amassing an unusually long list of projects marred by cost overruns, delays and litigation\", referring to his other projects around the world that were over budget. Especially because the current station has a ridership of only 46,000 daily passengers compared to 250,000 at Grand Central Terminal, the renovation is sometimes depicted as overpriced and overstylized. According to a writer for Esquire magazine, even if the hub's cost were disregarded, operating the PATH was itself a waste of money for the Port Authority.In late 2015, the opening was delayed to early 2016 by a leaking roof. When the hub opened in March 2016, the director of the Port Authority, Pat Foye, declined to hold an event to celebrate the opening of the Hub, describing it as \"symbol of excess\" and noting he was \"troubled with the huge cost\" of the construction project.\n\n\n=== Opening ===\n\nOn March 3, 2016, the Oculus partially opened to the public, along with new entrances. Only the west end of the Oculus and the Westfield Mall corridor to Four World Trade Center was opened. Two months later, on May 26, 2016, PATH riders received a direct underground link to Fulton Center and the Cortlandt Street\u2013Church Street station through the Oculus. The PATH entrance into 2 World Trade Center opened on June 21, 2016, and the temporary PATH entrance to outside 7 World Trade Center closed five days later. Yet another entrance opened to the public when the Westfield World Trade Center mall was opened on August 16. On September 8, 2016, the restrooms were opened on the south side of the mezzanine. The last two station platforms in the hub, Platforms C and D, were also opened, as was the permanent West Concourse walkway. On December 19, the direct underground link to the New York City Subway's World Trade Center station, at the northeast corner of the complex, reopened.Following the 17th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2018, the rubber seal of the Oculus's skylight broke. As a result, for the 18th anniversary in 2019, the skylight was unable to open as scheduled.\n\n\n=== Notable incidents ===\nOn October 13, 2016, the first birth inside the Oculus occurred. A woman was walking through the station with her husband when she went into labor, eventually giving birth on the floor. Another woman had previously given birth inside the old PATH station in August 2015.A few months later, on February 11, 2017, the first death inside the Oculus occurred. A woman from New Jersey, Jenny Santos, fell to her death from an escalator. News reports initially said she was trying to retrieve a hat dropped by her sister, but lost her balance and fell; it was later revealed that she \"was pretending to be flying\" while lying on the escalator's handrail. After her death, there was some focus on the height of the 3-foot-4-inch (1.02 m) handrails, and how they could pose a safety risk.\n\n\n== Adjacent transit connections ==\n\nThe Transportation Hub is designed to connect the PATH subway system to the New York City Subway system. The 1 service, which runs through the Transportation Hub, was reconstructed under this project to run above the PATH mezzanine. The 1 train's rebuilt WTC Cortlandt station, which opened in September 2018, has direct access into the Hub. There is also a direct access to the Chambers Street\u2013World Trade Center/Park Place/Cortlandt Street station complex. The N, \u200bR, and \u200bW trains' Cortlandt Street\u2013Church Street station also has direct access into the Hub. In addition, the Dey Street Passageway along Dey Street connects the Transportation Hub east to the Fulton Center, providing access to the 2, \u200b3\u200b, 4, \u200b5\u200b, A, \u200bC, \u200bE\u200b, J\u200b, N, \u200bR, \u200bW, and Z services. A passageway, known as the West Concourse, connects west to Brookfield Place and the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal.Between September 2003 and April 2004, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation conducted a feasibility study of the Lower Manhattan\u2013Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project. It would use the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic Branch to Downtown Brooklyn and a tunnel to Lower Manhattan to provide faster service to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The project was halted in 2008 before an environmental impact statement could be created.As of September 2018, current services include:\n\nThe Fulton Street station complex (where the Fulton Center opened in November 2014) is two blocks away to the east and is fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It features the following services:\n\nAt the northeast end of the station is the exit to the World Trade Center station of the New York City Subway. The doors and original ADA-accessible ramp, as well as the structure from the first World Trade Center leading into the station, survived the September 11 attacks. The station itself was not damaged, but it was covered by dust and was subsequently closed. The passageway reopened to provide an ADA-connection from the temporary PATH station to the New York City Subway station, but was closed again when the temporary PATH station closed for a reconstruction. The passageway was then covered in plywood for preservation purposes. The renovated entrance, leading to the New York City Subway station from the Oculus headhouse and the Westfield World Trade Center, opened on December 19, 2016. The newly reopened passageway retained its pre-9/11 design, save for a door on display that has the words \"MATF 1 / 9 13\" spray-painted on it (a message from Urban Search and Rescue Massachusetts Task Force 1 of Beverly, Massachusetts, who searched the World Trade Center site on September 13, 2001). There is a plaque above the spray-painting, explaining the message on the door. PATH was required to preserve the passageway's original design as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as a condition for getting funding to construct the Oculus and new stations. The passageway was not made ADA-accessible again until 2017, as there are twenty-six steps down from the mezzanine to the Oculus headhouse's lobby.The M55 New York City Bus route runs northbound on Church Street and 6th Avenue to Midtown, and southbound to South Ferry on Broadway.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPATH \u2013 World Trade Center\nnycsubway.org \u2013 World Trade Center: Port Authority Trans-Hudson",

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen); Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East Germany, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, the decline was first arrested and then reversed and, since then, Leipzig has seen significant changes with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, is rated as the most livable city in Germany by the GfK marketing research institution, and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library, as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and was the 2019 European City of the Year.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig and, during a stay in the city, Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" and is celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for its vital lifestyle and for its creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe that, most likely, refer to Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe University of Leipzig was founded in 1409 and Leipzig developed into an important centre of German law and of the publishing industry in Germany, resulting, in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library being located here.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.\n\nIn 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, they were unable to control the fires. Unlike the neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade.

After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Hauptbahnhof (lit. main station) is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the Intercity-Express (ICE) and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via three S-Bahn lines, two of which run via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg followed in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network considerably reduced the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

        "wiki": "Hildesheim Cathedral (German: Hildesheimer Dom), officially the Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary (German: Hohe Domkirche St. Mari\u00e4 Himmelfahrt) or simply St. Mary's Cathedral (German: Mariendom), is a medieval Roman Catholic cathedral in the city centre of Hildesheim, Germany, that serves as the seat of the Diocese of Hildesheim. The cathedral has been on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list since 1985, together with the nearby St. Michael's Church.\nThe cathedral church was built between 1010 and 1020 in the Romanesque style. It follows a symmetrical plan with two apses, that is characteristic of Ottonian Romanesque architecture in Old Saxony. The cathedral's treasures include world-famous artworks, bronze works from the time of Bishop Bernward, Bernward Doors and Bernward Column, as well as two of the four notable Romanesque wheel chandeliers: the Hezilo chandelier and the Azelin chandelier.\nAfter renovations and extensions in the 11th, 12th and 14th centuries, the cathedral was completely destroyed during an air raid on 22 March 1945 and rebuilt from 1950 to 1960.  A thorough renovation of the cathedral began in 2010, including technical and conservation measures.  Some of the cathedral's treasures have been shown further afield, including at an exhibition at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The cathedral was reopened on 15 August 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAfter the establishment of the Diocese of Hildesheim in 815 by Louis the Pious, a Chapel of St. Mary was built on the locations of the modern apse. Bishop Gunthar of Hildesheim, who was in office from 815 to 834, had a small basilica with two round towers built immediately to the south of the chapel, which he dedicated to Saint Cecilia. This served as the original cathedral and Stift church. The first four bishops were buried there. Only traces of the foundations of these two buildings remain. An older Hildesheim parish church probably once stood on the site of the Chapel of Saint Stephen next to the gatehouse at the eastern entrance to the chapel of St. Hellweg, which might date back to Hildegrim of Ch\u00e2lons and his expedition to East Saxony.The cathedral was built in 872 under Bishop Altfrid as a cruciform three-aisled basilica with a two-story westwork. It is an example of Ottonian architecture, with alternating column support and semi circular apses completing the naves. The building suffered severe fire damage in 1046. Bishop Azelin planned to erect a new, larger building further to the west and to extend the nave. His successor, Hezilo of Hildesheim, abandoned this plan and instead built on the old foundations, incorporating the surviving walls into the new building. Further important renovations occurred up to the end of the fourteenth century but did not deviate from the ground plan of Bishop Altfrid's basilica. The northern paradise and the north and south side chapels date from the gothic period and the tower above the crossing from the baroque period. In the nineteenth century, the original westwork was replaced by a Neo-Romanesque two-tower facade, which stood until 1945.\n\n\n=== School and library ===\nHildesheim Cathedral School (Hildesheimer Domschule, de), which had rooms in the cloisters, was one of the most significant educational institutions of the Ottonian and Salian periods. Its library has served as the cathedral's library (German: Dombibliothek Hildesheim) since 815; it is the oldest library in Northern Germany.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Destruction in the Second World War ===\nDuring the aerial bombardment of Hildesheim by the RAF and RCAF in World War II, the main building was almost entirely destroyed; only the westwork and the outer walls survived. Of the ancillary buildings, only the Gothic Anne's chapel (Annenkapelle), erected in 1321 in the middle of the cathedral's courtyard, was mostly undamaged. It was the only cathedral in Germany that had to be newly consecrated after its reconstruction, on 27 March 1960 by Bishop Heinrich Maria Janssen.\n\nThe building was rebuilt between 1950 and 1960 in a simplified form. The baroque elements were abandoned in favour of a form which took its cue from the early Romanesque style. The most visible aspect of this on the exterior was that upper stories, and side towers added to the westwork in 1840 were not restored, and the westwork was reconstructed closer to its earlier state based on the model of the westwork of Minden Cathedral. In addition, the gatehouse in front of the westwork was reduced by about half. Otherwise, the exterior appeared as it had done before the destruction \u2013 in particular, the baroque crossing-tower was rebuilt.The reconstruction was carried out under tight constraints. Because of the lack of sandstone tiles, the floor was relaid in marble. The roofs of the nave, transept, and cloisters were cast in concrete and covered with wooden boards on the inside to recall the appearance of ceiling beams. The interior walls, as well as the walls of the nave, were rebuilt in brick and limestone, hidden from view by a dimension stone coating on the outside and by a coat of smooth plaster on the inside. The ground level was raised by 60 cm, which resulted in the rooms having a squat appearance, especially in the transepts. The columns of the nave were cast in concrete, and the pilasters were coated in sandstone.The reconsecration took until 1960 to complete because of various problems, chiefly the \"Hildesheim Cathedral construction dispute\" (Hildesheimer Dombaustreit), an argument between the Diocese of Hildesheim and the Land of Lower Saxony about the cost of the reconstruction and particularly about whether Lower Saxony was one of the legal successors of the Free State of Prussia which had undertaken to cover the cathedral's building expenses in 1803 (when it was still the Kingdom of Prussia) during the process of German mediatization. The parties reached a settlement in 1957.\n\n\n=== Renovations 2010\u20132014 ===\n\nAfter many years of planning, a thorough renovation of the cathedral began in January 2010, the first since 1960. Along with technical and conservation measures, there were alterations to the design. The floor was lowered to the original level, the Hezilo and Azelin chandeliers were restored to their places in the nave and the high choir, and Bernward Doors were again mounted facing outwards, behind an antechamber, as originally intended. In addition, a bishop's crypt was created.On 10 January 2010, the cathedral was closed for the work to begin. During the reconstruction, the basilica of St. Godehard served as the bishop's church (cathedra), as it had in the postwar years. The cathedral renovation was the largest church construction project in Germany. The solemn reopening of the cathedral was on 15 August 2014, coinciding with the beginning of the Diocese's 1200 year jubilee.\n\n\n=== Thousand-year Rose ===\n\nThe cathedral building is widely known for the \"Thousand-year Rose\" (Tausendj\u00e4hriger Rosenstock) which grows outside the building on the outer wall of the apse in the courtyard of the cloisters. The exact age of the rose is no longer precisely known, but the legend of the rose bush claims that it dates to 815. It is an important symbol of Hildesheim - according to folklore, as long as the bush flourishes, Hildesheim will prosper.According to the story, Emperor Louis the Pious had to hold a Mass while out hunting in the middle of the forest. For this purpose, a reliquary of St. Mary which he had with him was hung from the branch of a wild rose. After the mass, the reliquary could not be removed from the branch. The Emperor considered this a sign that the new bishopric should be established here (not in Elze as he had planned) and he should dedicate it to St. Mary, whose symbol is the rose.The existence of the rose bush has been attested for at least four hundred years. The aerial bombardment of 22 March 1945 which damaged the cathedral and the apse also killed the main growth of the rose bush above the ground; under the rubble, only the charred stump of the rose remained. It was thought that the end of the famous rose had come, but the roots were largely intact, and in the spring of 1945 it put out 25 new shoots. The first sparse flowers bloomed in 1947, and by 1948 there were 122 flowers. Since then, the new branches of the \"Thousand-year Rose\" (as it was already known before the bombing) have been marked with little metal signs with the year in which they first appeared. It is believed to be the oldest living rose in the world.\n\n\n== Archaeological finds ==\nIn excavations during the 2010\u20132014 renovations of the cathedral, ninth-century foundations of the St. Mary's chapel were found. The first cathedral building was a small church measuring 6 \u00d7 6 m with an apse to the east. The remains of the first altar were found in the apse. The foundations of this first cathedral building consist of sandstone and are extraordinarily thick.An even older cemetery was found to the west and south. Twenty graves were uncovered, including, in August 2012,  the skeleton of a young woman who died around 800, with glass beads (the remnants of a necklace) and a little knife as grave goods. This is the oldest complete burial ever found in Hildesheim cathedral.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Interior decoration, art, and treasures ==\n\nThe cathedral houses numerous works of art. These include the world-famous cast-bronze doors, depicting scenes from the Gospels and the Book of Genesis; and a cast-bronze column depicting scenes from the life of Christ. These bronzeworks date from the early 11th century and were commissioned by Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim. (The column was originally in St Michael's, where Bernward was buried, and has been moved there again during the restoration of the cathedral, possibly to stay.)There are also four notable Romanesque wheel chandeliers, also called corona or circular chandeliers, the larger Hezilo chandelier (Heziloleuchter), and the older Azelin chandelier (Azelinleuchter). The Ringelheim Crucifix was made c.\u20091000 from linden wood for the body and oak for the arms.Other treasures include:\nThe shrine of St. Epiphanius of Pavia and Cathedral patrons over a chapel in the northeast, first half of the twelfth century\nThe shrine of St. Godehard in the crypt, around 1140\nThe Reliquary of Mary, the Crosses of Bernward and further magnificent reliquaries and liturgical implements displayed in Hildesheim Cathedral Museum (Dommuseum Hildesheim) in the south transept\nThe eagle lectern, c. 1220, in liturgical use up until the recent renovations\nThe late Romanesque bronze baptismal font (Bronzetaufe), 1225\nThe gothic Inkpot Madonna (Tintenfassmadonna)\nThe central table of the Wrisberg epitaph (in the south transept until the recent renovations))\nAn apse cross standing in the apse, the pedestal of which, legend has it, was made from the core of the Irminsul.\nthe Tomb of Priest Bruno (de) on the southern exterior wall of the choir\nThe Bernward Monument (de) of Carl Ferdinand Hartzer from 1893 stands in front of the north paradise entrance\nHildesheim rood screen (Hildesheimer Domlettner, de) in the Cathedral MuseumDuring the 2010\u20132014 renovations, many religious items from the Cathedral were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, until 5 January 2014.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Organs ==\nThe history of the organ at Hildesheim Cathedral dates back to the fourteenth century. In 1378, there was an organ in the north aisle, above the chapel of the Three Kings. This instrument was relocated to the Godehard choir during the fifteenth century and eventually sold in 1713.\nThe first large organ was built by Conrad Abtt (Minden) c. 1616/17. The instrument had 31 stops on two manuals and pedal. During the 17th and 18th century, the instrument was rebuilt and expanded. In 1909, Furtw\u00e4ngler & Hammer (Hannover) built a new organ with 54 stops (three manuals and pedal), re-using the organ case from 1617. On March 22, 1945 the organ was destroyed during an air raid.\n\n\n=== Organ 1960\u20132010 ===\nIn 1960, Franz Breil (Dorsten) built a new organ with 52 stops on four manuals and pedal. In 1989, it was partially rebuilt and expanded to 66 stops by Klais (Bonn).\n\n\n=== Seifert Organs (2014) ===\nIn 2014, Orgelbau Romanus Seifert & Sohn (Kevelaer) built a new organ with 77 stops on four manuals and pedal, re-using windchests and 56 stops from the previous instrument.In addition, a new antiphonal organ (Chororgel) with 16 stops was built. It is located in the left isle of the cathedral. Both organs can be played from two identical four-manual consoles: the console of the great organ, and a movable console in the nave.\n\n\n== Bells ==\n\nUntil the Second World War, the cathedral contained over sixteen ringing and quarter bells. The basis of the pre-war peal was five great bells with the tones F-sharp0, A0, C-sharp1, F-sharp1, G-sharp1. Nine bells of the pre-war peal survived the war; the great Godehard bell in the west tower was so severely damaged in an air raid that it could no longer be rung. The Bernard bell is in the Bell cemetery in Hamburg and was irreparably damaged during transport there. Two bells were capable of being reused: the historical Apostolica bell of bellfounder Johann Martin Roth of Mainz (1765), which could be integrated into the new peal, and another historic bell of Johann Martin Roth, the Nikolaus bell, which was originally hung in the crossing tower and was moved to the Nordparadies in 2010.\n\n\n=== Refounding of 1960 ===\nAfter the Second World War it was planned to create a 12-toned peal, with six great bells in the west tower and six smaller bells in the crossing tower (the planned tones: G1, B\u266d1, C2, E\u266d2, F2 and G2). \nAt first only a six tone peal was produced. In 1960 the bellfounder Friedrich Wilhelm Schilling (Heidelberg) cast five new bells, which were installed in the west tower together with the Apostolica bell. In the lower belfry of the tower hung the three deepest bells (1-3), while the three smaller bells (4\u20136) were in the upper belfry. The new peal (co-ordinated with the bells of the surrounding churches) was a semitone deeper than the original, so the Apostolica bell had to be tuned a semitone lower to fit with the new bells.Since the quarter bells had also been destroyed in the Second World War, the quarter-hour chimes were now struck by bell No. 5, the chime on the hour by bell No.4 and the chime at noon by bell No. 1. Bell No. 6 was used for the call to worship (the Angelusglocke).\n\n\n=== Renovation 2013/2014 ===\nIn the course of the 2010-14 renovation, the peal is being expanded by six bells to the 12-tone peal which had originally been planned in the 1960s, though, the tone sequence will be slightly different. The new cathedral bells will be named after witnesses of the faith, who enjoy particular veneration in the Diocese of Hildesheim. Thus bell No. 8 will be named for Bishop Altfrid, one of the most important bishops of Hildesheim, who secured large contributions for the construction of the cathedral. Bell No. 9 will be named after Hedwig of Schlesien (or of Andechs), patron of refugees - since many refugees came to Hildesheim after the Second World War and were crucial in shaping it.In 2013 the old yoke in the upper belfry was taken apart and replaced by a new yoke of oak. It will hold the six new bells and some of the old ones. In the lower belfry the deepest bells will remain in place.On 16 November 2013 the new bells were cast by Glockengie\u00dferei Bachert (Karlsruhe).The Cantabona bell is the second biggest of Lower-Saxony after the Christus- und Friedensglocke (Bell of Christ and Peace) in the Marktkirche, Hanover.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nHildesheim Cathedral was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.\n\n\n== Reopening ==\nOn 15 August 2014, the cathedral was reopened after restoration. Bishop Norbert Trelle opened the Bernward doors and entered the cathedral, followed by 30 other bishops and guests including the Protestant bishop Christoph Meyns, Robert Zollitsch, Stephan Weil and Christian Wulff. Trelle said in his sermon: \"Die Kirche muss auf die Zukunft hin leben, so wie sie aus der Vergangenheit heraus lebt.\" (The church has to live towards a future, as it lives from by the past). He added, regarding the situation in Syria: \"W\u00e4hrend wir hier einen Dom wiederer\u00f6ffnen, brennen dort die Kirchen.\" (While we reopen a cathedral here, churches are burnt there). The cathedral was restored to an appearance closer to the original building from the medieval age, for example a ceiling inserted after World War II was removed, and the original floor level restored. A new altar was created by Ulrich R\u00fcckriem.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nHildesheim Cathedral is situated at the southern middle of the city centre of Hildesheim, on the so-called Domh\u00fcgel (\"Cathedral's Hill\"). The main entrances to the cathedral are on the south and north sides. The Roemer- and Pelizaeus-Museum, is very close to the cathedral in the west. Around the hill is the wall of the Domburg. From the north of the Hill is the Michaelish\u00fcgel (\"St. Michael's Hill\"), from the northeast is the downtown of Hildesheim and to the west is the River M\u00fchlengraben, a tributary of the Innerste River. On the north of the cathedral is the former government building of the city, on the west the Episcopal Vicariate General of the Diocese, in the south the Gymnasium Josephinum school and on the east the Labour Court of the city.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBrandt, Michael (2009), Bernwards S\u00e4ule \u2013 Sch\u00e4tze aus dem Dom zu Hildesheim (in German), Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner, ISBN 978-3-7954-2046-8.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 (2010), Bernwards T\u00fcr \u2013 Sch\u00e4tze aus dem Dom zu Hildesheim (in German), Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner, ISBN 978-3-7954-2045-1.\nGallistl, Bernhard (2007\u20132008), \"In Faciem Angelici Templi.

          "This is a very impressive church with 3 spires. In the new town so about 10 minutes walk from Princess Street. It as the most fabulous alter. Large cavernous interior but some may find quite dark. Nice selection of stained glass windows.",
          "Smaller than we expected, quite dark inside, but Admittedly a winters day....the organ was in pieces while they redo it, im summary probably more impressive from the outside than the inside.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral on a path between 2 castles. Not as \"grand\" as many other cathedrals in Europe but who cares.. do stop in as it is well preserved and beautiful house of worship.",
          "As most cathedrals this also an interesting one.nice stop during a city walk. Pleasant when it rains or on a hot day.",
          "On a dreich December's evening, we decided to walk into this splendid cathedral. I sat and took in the grand surroundings. The organist was quietly practising, with about 5 visitors listening to his talent. Individuals were lighting candles to remember loved ones. Solitude.",
          "If you are in the area, you should see it but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way. It is very nice but other churches are more spectacular.",
          "Make sure to take your time to visit this beautiful church it was well worth the time. Wonderful stain glass windows.",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is a beautiful building. The architecture is absolutely wonderful, inside and outside. We had the opportunity for a brief visit during our stay in Edinburgh. The church was built in the late 19th century and is now on a protected List. It is certainly worth",
          "During the Festival in August the Cathedral does tours of the normally closed Song School with its stunning nineteenth century murals by Phoebe Traquair. They took four years to complete and are a treat for the eyes - to think that she didn't even get a penny for all her work!",
          "Ever passed by a building and just had to stop and stare at it for hours? This is a place that will catch your artistic eye and that little inner soul that is looking for some truth and understanding. The location is beautiful and Edinburgh is worth staying in for a few days so",
          "St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral is situated in Palmerston Place in the West End it is only a short walk from the end of Princes St. When the city is very busy it is a nice place to sit and reflect or join in a morning or evening service. It is a magnificent structure and it's",
          "Visited during Festival when Edinburgh is at its craziest. The Church its self is quite an attractive building and is well worth a look around. We were also there for a tour of the Cathedrals song school and its PhoebeTraquair murals which I dont think are viewable very often",
          "The church itself is beautiful and the complex is massive. If you are in the West End it is worth making a stop to see it. The grounds are well kept and inviting as well.",
          "As a few others have pointed out, there are 2 St Mary\u2019s cathedrals in Edinburgh. The one is the west end is an episcopalian church associated with a music school (known locally as the \u2018song school\u2019). We visited this St Mary\u2019s which is an impressive Gothic cathedral, built in the",
          "Visiting the cathedral you should also take a stroll in the nearby cemetery. Interesting and peaceful. Only tourists are disturbing you.",

          "By historical standards this isn't really that old of a church for Scotland. Built in the early 1800 it is still very impressive and beautiful. An interesting side-lite I found interesting was although originally built by the poor German immigrants in that part of the city,",

          "We went to church at St. Mary\u2019s this past Sunday. It is a beautiful building inside and out. The folks were exceptionally friendly and the mass was very touching. The organ/organist was exceptional and the choir was amazing. The Episcopal Church of Scotland can be very proud.",
          "We wandered inside during a a ceremony of some kind. We were allowed in by a nice lady and she gave us some short information about the church. Beautiful. Not much else to say.",

          "More recent than most: 1800s. Early morning light through the stained glass makes the nave very pretty. Incredible carvings around doors and arches. Three towers -- all tall. Main tower goes from square to an octagon which is pretty unique. Walk around the whole thing.",

          "Visited as part of fringe festival to listen to a lunchtime recital from Joana Gama, impressive performance. Wasn\u2019t able to look around the cathedral due to time and the recital but would have loved too. Definitely worth a look around. About 15 minutes walk from the main",

          "Like everything else in Edinburgh, the architecture is magnificent. The inside is breathtaking and serene, and just a marvel in design.",
          "I have to agree and confess that the St. Giles Cathedral on the Royal Mile is the most magnificent church of Edinburgh but then St. Mary's Cathedral at Palmerston Place has a charm of its own. I was not lucky enough to be there to witness a mass / service but then what I",
          "Most visitors will just walk down Palmerston Place and gaze upon the gothic cathedral with the 3 spires - but go on in on a sunny day and look to the right as the sun floods in through the Paolozzi stained glass window. Amazing. Try and capture a service or even one of the",

          "Looking forward to visiting Edinburgh on the 14/15 July and in particular this beautiful cathedral where my daughters amazing school chapel choir will be performing during three services over the weekend. For service times refer to St Mary\u2019s. Thoroughly recommended to all and",
          "Sublime cathedral anchoring the West End. Attending a service really unlocks the beauty and spirit of the place. We attended Evensong when the famous choir was on half term holiday. The intimate service in a side chapel was monastic, reflective and prayerful. Quietly moving. The",

          "St Marys Catherdral was as expected, simply beautiful. The stain glass windows are worth the trip alone, the small details, marble accents add to the overall beauty.",
          "A nice cool place to stroll on a hot day, with some lovely stained glass from different eras, including 3 from Paolozzi. See these in conjunction with his exhibits and reconstructed studio at the nearby National Gallery of Modern Art.",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is a three spired Cathedral located on the west of side of New Town. St. Mary's is a classic Gothic church with a spectacular Organ, and without tourist. Jolly Chris.",
          "Although St Giles' on the Royal Mile, is the more famous Cathedral in Edinburgh in it would be a fatal to overlook St Mary's. It's towering beauty manifest itself into a magical experience once inside, and it's a real hidden gem.",
          "Very impressive Gothic style cathedral. Was reluctant to go, but went at my wife's urging; and very glad to have made the visit. Great architecture inside and out. Many areas inside including the High Alter, and magificent pipe organ, and amazing stained glass, plus other",
          "I love looking around cathedrals, churches, and other religious monuments, despite not being religious myself, for the mirror they hold up to the time in which they were built. Unfortunately, this cathedral fails to do that, being a little bland, apart from a magnifiecent organ.",
          "This is a massive building although only some of it is accessible - for instance the towers cannot be visited. As with so many of these churches it was quite beautiful. The highlight for us was finding the pew that belonged to Sir Walter Scott and being able to actually sit in",
          "Beautiful place of faith and peace. And one with a conscience. Some lovely art. The Presence! The shrine chapel of St Charles the Martyr. Glorious choral music daily.",
          "There is neither ornate decoration nor celebrities buried here, and there is no comparison with many other Roman Catholic churches in Continental Europe, but remember first and foremost this is a place of worship and not a tourist attraction.",
          "An impressive edifice. Great place to walk and see. The site is quiet and cavernous; you feel less as if this was built from stone and more as if it's an underground cave. Once inside it's hard to believe that there really is an outside and that you're not miles underground.",
          "Easter su day mass was a fantastic experience. Thank you to the priests & altar servers (all girls) for a wonderful celebration.",
          "Very impressive, you will not be disappointed, there is an information desk on entry. The staff are very friendly and helpful \ud83d\ude0a",
          "We enjoy seeing famous churches and cathedrals so we made a point to see St. Mary's Cathedral and it was great. Beautiful building built in the 19th century. Worth seeing.",
          "It's an old church with a long history. I found it when I was walking to the Dean Village. Should walk inside and take a look. Spend 20-30mins.",
          "This beautiful church does not get the recognition it deserves as a must see tourist attraction in Edinburgh. For starters it is a bit off the beaten track, being a way to the west of Princes St and the new town. It also does not promote itself, nor advertise enough on social",
          "This place has been on my to do list for a while and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Beautiful architecture.",
          "Stopped in this morning enroute to the tram station from our hotel. A gentleman let us enter for the back door. With the sun shining, the inside of the church was beautiful: the sun shining through the stain glass windows made it beautiful. They also had a nice photographic",
          "Even though it was created as late as the end of the 19th century, the Gothic features with a terrific facade are wonderful. On approach the verticality of the triumvirate of spires was captivating. The ornamentation of the entrance portico is striking. The interior is most",
          "This is the 'Anglican' one of the three fine 'Cathedrals' in the city, the others being St. Mary's RC', and the St Giles-part of The Church of Scotland that does not have cathedrals! Try to attend Sung Evensong with an exceptional Choir.",
          "This cathedral is well worth a visit. There is much beauty to behold and it is far better than St. Giles Cathedral which we found quite unattractive.",
          "This cathedral was beautiful, historic and very welcoming, entry is based on donation so please help support these historic sites when you visit",
          "Very interesting and impressive cathedral. Interesting memory plaques of fallen officers and people related to the cathedral.",
          "Episcopal Cathedral that is not only impressive and very, very well kept but also welcoming. Always worth going in and enjoying both the calm atmosphere and the many items and information they put on display about special activities like commemorative dates, etc. Conveniently",
          "My family and I come here every Sunday night for mass and never been disappointed. Lovely priest and impressive windows and seating. Lovely Christmas mass that was celebrated.",
          "This is a beautiful Roman Catholic Cathedral right near the centre of Edinburgh. Enjoyed a lovely Mass there on Sunday night. Friendly parishioners and priest. A place of tranquility in a bustling city. For those going over the next week or so, there are a group of German",
          "This is one of the most beautiful buildings in Edinburgh. It's is beautifully designed and the perfect place for a silent prayer or some time to yourself. The architecture is magnificent. Please don't miss this on your visit!! Go go go.",
          "Such a glorious place with magnificent wall paintings and stained glass windows, both ancient and modern. Lovely fragrance of incense lingering in the air which added to the atmosphere.",
          "Went in to look for a memorial to my uncle. Great place to walk around or sit and have a of piece and quiet just of the West End",
          "The archetecture and photo ops were outstanding! Great location, very welcoming, and a pleasure to see.",
          "More or less 2 blocks out of Princess street - it is a wonderful Cathedral in the way to the Modern Art Gallery",
          "I visited this Cathedral for a Classical Music Concert. The towers from the outside are really impressive yet don't reflect the grandeur of the inside .The sheer height and scale of the stonework is astounding . . Lovely comfortable seats , how delightful. The High Alter is a",
          "When standing up on Calton hill during a sunset of our recent visit to Edinburgh, the city is so beautiful, with it's old buildings, and flags, towers and of course dreamy spires, which St Marys is one that contributes to the beautiful vista that is Edinburgh's skyline,",
          "I agree with others that this no architectural marvel like St. Giles, but it is still a nice place. There are also statues outside, one of which is a hand. Though it has prayerful meaning, it reminded me of my cousin as I waked past it nearly every day on my three week visit.",
          "Not as amazing as other pieces in the city, this building still deserves an eye. Very smart the idea of an entrance all made of glass, which allows the tourists to look at the beautiful ceiling of the church without interruption the mass.",
          "A beautiful and serene church, we'll worth the visit, photos allowed for a fee which is very reasonable the atmosphere reminds you of were you are, beautiful stained glass windows well wktprth the visit and it's free.",
          "It is a lovely church, though I would not say it is a must see. However, if you do go in, on the right side of the church, while facing front, there are two interesting icons. One is of Jesus Christ, life size, and the other is of a nun, priest and I believe, cardinal. The eyes",
          "St. Mary's Cathedral is a striking old building set in large grounds. Free to enter it is a must see with wonderful architecture, paintings and windows.",

          "Wonderful 'old' church beautiful inside, many old paintings beautiful pipe organ fills the church, the player was practising some music while we were there",
          "On Saturday the 3rd Sept 2016, I was invited to attend the 88th Annual Festivals for the Guild of Servers. Started with a procession round part of the Cathedral outside & into the Cathedral, followed by High Mass. Enjoyable day attended by around 40 folks mostly servers like",
          "We found this while we were walking to another place. It was beautiful. It is a place you can sit and see something special whichever way you look. We live in the US and have not seen many churches anywhere in the states as magnificent.",
          "My wife and I went to Mass at 10AM two Sundays ago. We were quite surprised that the Mass was in the Polish language. We could follow along, but frankly, we didn't understand a word that was said. It was a nice experience though. The Church itself is beautiful but not grand.",
          "This 19th Century Gothic Revival Cathedral pulls out all the stops. Built in the 13th Century perpendicular style it adheres to the strict requirements of the Gothic Revival which was more than an architectural style. It was a British National movement triggered in part by the",
          "We took a taxi from the modern art museum and told the taxi driver to park the car while we looked at this church before going to our hotel downtown. We looked in the church and it was not very impressive. We took only about 10 minutes to see everything. The stained glass was",
          "The elegiac magic of the sung service at midnight never ceases to offer a meditative soul warming preparation for the introspective epicentre of the year! Go early though and wrap up, a truly mystical experience.",
          "My wife and I attended a choir performance here, and it was very lovely. The cathedral itself is very beautiful and worth visiting.",
          "Attended mass at St. Mary's the first day of our trip to Scotland. It was a high mass and the choir and organist were outstanding. One of the few Catholic Churches in Edinburgh. Pope John Paul visited the \"cathedral\" on his visit to Scotland, church has a couple of Polish masses",
          "It was beautiful and the architecture was a treat to watch. The entire atmosphere was so serene. Would strongly recommend",
          "visited on a walking tour; lovely old church. since I was on a tour I did not get the chance to linger as long as I would have liked but still enjoyed the brief visit we had.",
          "This is worth a visit but it is not a special cathedral although it has some interesting history. It was commissioned by Bishop George hay in 1801 and the first Mass was in 1814 and since then has seen a visit from the Pope. apparently it grew with immigrants from Ireland",
          "We visited the Cathedral Church of St Mary in Edinburgh in May 2016 because we like very much architecture and because it was highly recommended among places to see in Edinburgh. The building of the Cathedral has been finished in 1879. It is a large church with very beautiful",
          "Was passing by and popped in to have a looksee. Beatiful church with lots of restaurated memories on the walls. Just tranquil and perfect to slow yourself down when visiting a great city.",
          "Beautiful place to come and visit, peaceful and very welcoming, beautiful music is played and it truly is a wonderful atmosphere. Highly recommend this on a lunchtime stroll",
          "Had the good fortune to sing at services over a weekend. The building alone is well worth a visit. Not the most stunning, but it has some lovely stained glass window's. As others have reviewed it is a working cathedral, but it is also peaceful. However there was a wonderful",
          "I went in while passing by on my way to Dean Village. It is a nice cathedral but nothing extraordinary.",
          "There seems to be a lot of confusion about \"St. Mary's Cathedral\" There are in fact two St. Mary's Cathedrals in Edinburgh. The Catholic cathedral is situated at the East end of Princes Street in Broughton Street. Ask 99% of Edinburgh's citizen's where St. Mary's Cathedral is",
          "This gorgeous RC Cathedral and grounds in Palmerston place is a must visit attraction for anyone interested in the splendor of of 19th century houses of worship. The architecture is spectacular and although it is much less visited that its big cousin, St Giles (or more",
          "One of the largest cathedrals I have seen in Scotland. By far one of the most impressive. I frequent this place every time in Edinburgh. Last week I was fortunate enough to hear the choir and pipe organ rehearsal. I recommend stopping by and having a look. The clergy and",
          "nice addition to Edinburgh's skyline. has a lot of character and was nice from architecture point of view. Not blown away but still was an interesting visit to this cathedral.",
          "Very interesting visit to the Cathedral. A peaceful place to rest in the busy city centre. There was lots of interesting things to read and see around the Cathedral. Particularly to learn of the St Mary's Music School.",
          "I forgot how large this place is. The last time I was here was Dec. 2005 and they had lights everywhere and the manger scene with ice skating near by. This is a very nice classical cathedral. Gothic gorgeous on the outside and pretty on the inside but you can tell that it`s more",
          "Went to st Mary's cathedral for our Sunday mass in the evening. Very solemn mass delivered by the priest. You will notice as well the spectacular architecture of the church when you go inside. A must see in Edinburg only walking distance from princess street in the new town.",
          "We only saw this cathedral from a distance, as we zoomed by on a bus to the zoo. Next time I'm in Edinburgh, I want to stop by however, because it certainly looked like on of the most impressive church buildings I've seen in the city. Beautiful!",
          "nice to look around and free but a donation would be apprecated to help with the upkeep, but is a nice cathedral",
          "this church is nice and no any another comments for this just visit during the day trip in this city.",
          "As with all buildings of this age your breath is taken away when you walk in and you walk out with a crick in your neck looking up at the spectacular roof and architecture. The interior is full of history and is obviously a place of worship to be revered.",
          "Just simply beautiful and just so serene.A spectacular building inside and out.Light a candle,say a prayer and look at the beauty of this place.Really just perfect.",
          "A quite immense Catholic church from the outside, St. Marys is quite small on the inside with rugged pews close together and many alcoves in its interior. Another catholic church,St. Patricks in the style of a small country church can be found off the Royal mile though the Grey",
          "A standard lovely Cathedral. Worth a quick visit on the way into town. It's not particularly busy which is great! We didn't any attend of the services but you could definitely give it a try.",
          "We were lucky enough to be staying very close to this cathedral, and saw it as soon as we arrived. In the dark, it is imposing and beautiful. During the day, it is completely stunning. The bricks are so dark they are almost black, which adds to its beauty. It is just as amazing",
          "Was here last August during the fringe and we went to a violin concert which was simply amazing. Enjoyed every minute of it.",
          "Whether a Christian or not, if you appreciate religious culture and heritage, do NOT forget to visit here!",

          "Like an earlier reviewer suggested, I approached St Mary's from Melville Street. I was using Google map and was just following the directions and when I turned the corner into Melville Street, I was awestruck by the sight before me, this tall and gothic building against innocent",
          "A beautiful building as well as being home to a welcoming congregation. The choir is wonderful, the preaching is pertinent.",
          "A grand cathedral with an impressive exterior and an even more grand interior with high ceiling, beautiful stained glass and large organ.",

        "wiki": "The Church of St. Michael (German: Michaeliskirche) is an early-Romanesque church in Hildesheim, Germany. It has been on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list since 1985. It is now a shared church, the main church being Lutheran and the crypt being Roman Catholic.\n\n\n== History ==\nBishop Bernward of Hildesheim (996\u20131022) built a Benedictine monastery from the ground up on a hill linked with the archangel Michael just a half kilometer north of the city walls of his seat (Hildesheim), a monastery that featured an imposing church some 70 meters in length overall. Bernward set the first stone for the new church in 1010 and dedicated the still unfinished building to Michael on the archangel's feast day, 29 September 1022, just a few weeks before his death. Construction, however, continued under his successor, Bishop Godehard (died 1038), who completed the work in 1031 and reconsecrated the church to Michael on September 29 of that year.  The church has double choirs east and west, double tripartite transepts at either end of the nave, and six towers\u2014two large ones over the crossings east and west, and four other tall and narrow ones attached to the small sides of the two transepts.  The eastern choir featured three apses, and the west had a deep chapel with a huge single apse rising high over an elaborate cross-vaulted hall crypt with an ambulatory.  Bishop Bernward's remains were placed in the western crypt.\nThe monastery comprised a church family and had two other sanctuaries dedicated to Martin and the Holy Cross lying in the cloister that extended northward from St. Michael's north flank.  The monastery and church opened southward toward the city of Hildesheim, its south flank comprising a facade of a sort.  It seems likely that the monastery on the Hill of St. Michael was surrounded by a wall.In 1186, after a reconstruction following a fire, Hildesheim's Bishop Adelog of Dorstedt \u2013 assisted by Tammo, Prince-Bishop of Verden \u2013 reconsecrated St. Michael's.\nWhen the people of Hildesheim became Protestant in 1542, St. Michael's became Lutheran, but the Benedictine monastery operated here until it was secularized in 1803. Monks continued to use the church, especially its western choir and crypt, down to that moment.\nSt. Michael's Church was heavily damaged in an air raid during World War II on 22 March 1945, but reconstruction was begun in 1950 and completed in 1957. In 1985, the church became a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site, along with the Cathedral of Hildesheim, its collection of medieval treasures and its 1000-year-old rosebush.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nSt. Michael's Church is one of the most important churches of early Christian period architecture. It is a double-choir basilica with two transepts and a square tower at each crossing. The west choir is emphasized by an ambulatory and a crypt. Nikolaus Pevsner wrote that St. Michael's \"is the earliest surviving example of a truly Romanesque exterior.\"The ground plan of the building follows a geometrical conception, in which the square of the transept crossing in the ground plan constitutes the key measuring unit for the entire church. The square units are defined by the alternation of columns and piers. Pevsner described this as a \"more thorough 'metrical system'\" than found in any prior Romanesque architecture.The ceiling of the church is decorated with a fresco, 27.6 m long and 8.7 m wide, depicting the Tree of Jesse, the ancestral line of Jesus. The famous Bernward Doors, featuring bronze reliefs of scenes from the Bible, were originally commissioned for St. Michael's, but are now found at the nearby Cathedral of Hildesheim.The painted wooden ceiling in the nave (around 1230) shows the genealogy of Christ.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Measurements ==\nTotal length: 74.75 m\nTotal length of the transepts: 40.01 m\nTotal width of the transepts: 11.38 m\nLength of the crypt: 18.36 m\nLength of the nave: 27.34 m\nWidth of the nave incl. lower aisles: 22.75 m\nWidth of the nave without lower aisles: 8.60 m\nHeight of the nave without lower aisles: 16.70 m\nThickness of the walls: 1.63 m\n\n\n== Location ==\nSt. Michael's Church is situated at the Western rim of the city centre of Hildesheim, on the so-called Michaelish\u00fcgel (\"St. Michael's Hill\"). The main entrance to the Church is at the south side. Magdalenengarten, a baroque park, is very close to the church in the west. The cloister is also accessible from there. It leads to the Church's contemporary (administrative) buildings. From the south and east of the Hill is Hildesheim's downtown, to the west is the River Innerste and in the north the Gymnasium Andreanum school.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nBernward of Hildesheim\n\n\n== See also ==\nBernward Column\nSaint Michael in the Catholic Church\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt Mary's Cathedral and St Michael's Church at Hildesheim / UNESCO Official WebsiteIntroduction to the Michaeliskirche (Hornemann Institut)\nExhibition \"Bernwards Sch\u00e4tze\" (Bernward's Treasures) online Hannoverische Allgemeine photo gallery (in German)\nSt. Michael's Church, Hildesheim on sekulada.com (in Polish)",

        "wiki": "Ernst August, Hereditary Prince of Hanover (German: Ernst August Prinz von Hannover Herzog zu Braunschweig und L\u00fcneburg, K\u00f6niglicher Prinz von Gro\u00dfbritannien und Irland; born 19 July 1983) is the eldest child of Ernst August, Prince of Hanover (head of the ancient House of Welf which once ruled the Kingdom of Hanover), and his former wife Chantal Hochuli.\n\n\n== Background ==\nErnst August and his younger brother Christian, were born in Hildesheim, Lower Saxony, while their half-sister, Alexandra was born in Austria and lives with her mother in Monaco. Ernst August was baptized on 15 October 1983 at Marienburg Castle, his godparents including Felipe VI of Spain and Constantine II of Greece.\nErnst August is distantly in the line of succession to the British throne as a descendant of Queen Victoria. Despite the family's residing in Germany through both World Wars, his paternal grandfather obtained British citizenship for himself and his children in November 1956 under the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705, and their family owned property and conducted business in the post-war United Kingdom. Until his mid-teens, Ernst August and his brother lived at Hurlingham Lodge in London.He also descends from Germany's last emperor, Wilhelm II, following whose abdication at the end of World War I the Hanovers also lost sovereignty over the Duchy of Brunswick, while retaining much of their continental personal property.\n\n\n== Career and asset management ==\n\nErnst August attended Malvern College and then studied history and national economy in New York City. After moving back to London he worked in the banking business for some years. Among other jobs, he worked with an open-end fund of the Islamic Investment Bank in Bahrain and with a London investment bank specialized on financing smaller mining and technology companies in newly industrialized countries.After his marriage in 2017 he and his wife moved to Hanover.\nAlready in 2004, his father had signed over to him the German property of the House of Hanover, including gothic-revival Marienburg Castle, the agricultural estates of Calenberg Castle and the F\u00fcrstenhaus (\"Princely House\") at Herrenhausen Gardens in Hanover; the elaborate museum in this small palace, built by King George I of Great Britain in 1720, has been closed to the public since 2011. Since 2004, the prince has taken over many representative tasks on behalf of his father.\nThe father remained in charge of the Austrian family assets until 2013 when he was removed from the chairmanship of a family foundation based in Liechtenstein, the Duke of Cumberland Foundation, which holds the properties near Gmunden in Austria, the Hanovers' main residence in exile after 1866 when their Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia. Instead, the younger Ernst August was put in charge, reportedly for negligence on part of his father, at the initiative of the foundation's trustee Prince Michael of Liechtenstein. The foundation manages vast forests, \"Cumberland Wildlife Park\", the Queen's Villa, a hunting lodge and the mausoleum at Cumberland Castle. In 2017 Ernst August the Elder filed legal action to recover chairmanship.\nIn 2014, Ernst August lent a number of paintings and objects for a Lower Saxony state exhibition, When the Royals came from Hanover - The rulers of Hanover on England's throne, which included exhibits in five museums and castles under the auspices of Charles, Prince of Wales. Thirty of more than 1000 items were contributed by Elizabeth II, including the State Crown of George I, while Ernst August provided the king's famous Augsburg silver throne and other furniture dating to 1720. He hosted a parallel exhibition, The Way to the Crown, at Marienburg Castle until through 2016, displaying - among other items - the crown jewels of the Kingdom of Hanover.\nIn 2005 he sold large parts of the family's art and furniture collections in an auction at Sotheby\u2019s, with a result of 44 million Euros. He had initially planned to allocate the funds in a foundation for the renovation and maintenance of Marienburg Castle, however was forced to use most of it to settle his father's debt, which, at the time, had been unknown to him, as he told a newspaper in 2019. In 2011 he sold the manor house and stables at Calenberg, retaining the land. Stating that its proceeds wouldn't suffice to maintain Marienburg Castle, infested with dry rot and threatened by static problems, he entered into negotiations with the State of Lower Saxony regarding the future of the castle, and its renovation, estimated at 27 million Euros. In November 2018 he announced that he planned to transfer the castle to a state-controlled foundation (the Hanoverian Monasteries' Chamber, founded by his family in 1569, which still owns most of the secularized monasteries and ecclesiastical estates of the former kingdom), at a symbolic sales price of 1 Euro, with the foundation undertaking renovation. The remaining art collection was planned to be kept in the castle, with parts purchased by the state, parts kept by the family and lent to the state, and parts transferred to a foundation controlled by both the family and the state. The transaction however was stopped by his father's legal action, seeking to regain ownership.\n\n\n== Marriage and issue ==\nIn the summer of 2016 Ernst August became engaged to Ekaterina Malysheva (b. 30 July 1986, Apatity, Russia), a Russian designer. Days before the wedding, the elder Ernst August publicly stated concerns about potential adverse impacts on family assets if the younger Ernst August were to marry his chosen fianc\u00e9e. Although his father and grandfather had obtained orders-in-council as recently as 1999 from George VI and Elizabeth II, respectively, authorizing their marriages as male-line descendants of George III as required by the British Royal Marriages Act, that law was effectively repealed in 2015. Despite the dynastic tradition of obtaining the head of House Hanover's express, prior authorization for an heir's marriage in accordance with an 1836 Hanoverian house law (as Ernst August's father had done when marrying his sons' future mother in 1981), the bridegroom's father declared his intention to withhold consent for his son's marriage to Ekaterina Malysheva, reportedly in a dispute over family assets.\n\nNonetheless the civil marriage took place on 6 July 2017 in Hanover's New Town Hall and was conducted by the mayor of Hanover, Stefan Schostok. The church marriage took place on 8 July 2017 in the Hanover Market Church at which the former Landesbischof of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover, Horst Hirschler, presided. The bride was escorted by her father, Igor Malyshev. Her wedding dress was the work of Lebanese designer Sandra Mansour, and she wore a tiara that belonged to the former Kaiser Wilhelm II's only daughter, Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia.\nAmong the wedding guests were: Prince Christian of Hanover, Princess Alexandra of Hanover, Andrea Casiraghi, Tatiana Santo Domingo, Pierre Casiraghi, Beatrice Borromeo, Charlotte Casiraghi, Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia and his wife Princess Sophie, Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece and his wife Crown Princess Marie-Chantal, Hereditary Prince Hubertus of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Alexander, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe and Princess Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis. The father of the groom, Prince Ernst August, did not attend the wedding. From the church, the royal couple rode in a horse carriage to Herrenhausen Gardens for the wedding reception in the Gallery Building. In the evening, a ball took place at Marienburg Castle.\nThe couple have one daughter, Elisabeth, born on 22 February 2018, at Henriettenstift hospital in Hanover, and one son, Welf August, born there on 14 March 2019.\n\n\n== Titles, styles, and honours ==\n\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n19 July 1983 \u2013 9 December 1987: His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August of Hanover\n9 December 1987 \u2013 present: His Royal Highness The Hereditary Prince of HanoverIn Germany, the legal privileges of royalty and nobility were abolished in 1919; thereafter for legal purposes, hereditary titles form part of the surname only. Nonetheless, while descendants of non-dynastic marriages may have a legal right to the use of \"Prinz/Prinzessin von Hannover Herzog/Herzogin zu Braunschweig und L\u00fcneburg K\u00f6niglicher Prinz/Prinzessin von Gro\u00dfbritannien und Irland\" as surnames, they are not recognized as bearing rank, styles titles or membership appertaining to the House of Hanover, according to its house rules. Nor is the title \"Prince/ss of Great Britain and Ireland\", re-claimed by the deposed House of Hanover in 1931, accorded by British sovereigns to members thereof born after 30 November 1917. In his British passport however, the prince bears the family name Guelph and is styled His Royal Highness.\n\n\n=== Honours ===\n House of Hanover: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Ernst August\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site of the House of Welf (in German)",

The gardens are a heritage of the Kings of Hanover.\nThe Great Garden has always been one of the most distinguished Baroque gardens of Europe while the Berggarten has been transformed over the years from a simple vegetable garden into a large botanical garden with its own attractions. Both the Georgengarten and the Welfengarten have been made in the style of English gardens, and both are considered popular recreation areas for the residents of Hannover. The history of the gardens spans several centuries, and they remain a popular attraction to this day.\n\n\n== The Great Garden ==\n\n \n\nThe Great Garden owes much of its aesthetics to Sophia of Hanover, consort of the Elector of Hanover and herself heiress to the British throne, who in 1683 commissioned the French gardener Martin Charbonnier to enlarge an existing garden. It served as a summer retreat, located only a few kilometers outside the city, while the Leineschloss was the main residence in town. As its name implies, it indeed became a large garden, comprising 50 hectares of lawns, hedges, walkways, and statues arranged in strict geometrical patterns.\nThe centerpiece of the garden is the rather small Herrenhausen Palace, originally a manor house of 1640 which had been enlarged since 1676. Whereas Sophia's husband, Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Luneburg, planned its replacement with a large baroque palace, and began constructions with the nearby grand Gallery Building, their son, elector George Louis, who in 1714 succeeded to the British throne as King George I, gave the palace project up and concentrated on water features. Sophia, Ernest Augustus and George I are buried in the mausoleum in the Berggarten.\nThe next king, George II, planned again for a new palace in better proportion with the Great Garden, but never realized it. His successor George III, who never visited Herrenhausen, had the palace modernized in neoclassical style by G. F. Laves. It suffered immense damage during World War II (the Royal Air Force were requested by the British Royal Family not to attack the palace, at the time still owned by the House of Hanover, but in fact it was hit by bombs during an air raid in 1943). The ruins of the palace were almost completely torn down after the war; the outside staircase once leading up to the entrance was salvaged from the debris and moved next to the Orangerie building where it can be seen today. In 2009, it was decided to rebuild the palace. Herrenhausen Palace was reopened on 17 January 2013.\nEvery summer, the Great Garden plays host a large variety of festivals. The \"Festival of Small Arts\" (Kleinkunstfestival) takes place over several days and offers a wide range of artistic displays, and the \"Small Festival in the Great Garden\" (Kleines Fest im Gro\u00dfen Garten) has become firmly entrenched as a highlight of the \"Festival Week Herrenhausen\" (Festwochen Herrenhausen). Lastly, the garden is the site of an international fireworks competition which evolved from a local attraction.\nThe \"State Stage of Hanover\" (Landesb\u00fchne Hannover) uses the Garden Theatre of the Great Garden during the summer for both musicals and other theatrical performances. Similarly, the building that houses the garden's orangery is utilized for both art exhibits and performances of classical music; matinee performances are presented in the foyer. The focal point of the garden is the Great Fountain which can, with optimal weather conditions, reach a maximum height of 80 meters. The original fountain was based on ideas of Gottfried Leibniz and was inaugurated in 1719 during the visit of George I. In 1721, it reached a height of some 35 m which made it the highest fountain in European courts. The fountain and its pumping works were renewed in 1860.\nThe Great Garden is also the site of one of the last works of the artist Niki de Saint Phalle. She modified the three-roomed grotto in the northwestern section of the garden, which had served as a store room in the eighteenth century, by adding various items, including crystals, minerals, glass and seashells. Between 2001 and 2003, when the exhibit opened, de Saint Phalle and her coworkers covered the walls and interior with mosaics of molded glass and mirrors. Two rooms branch off from the octagon-shaped central room, and on the front wall of each of them is a statue set within a small recession in the wall. De Saint Phalle's intention for this exhibit was that the visitors could use the grotto as a cool retreat on hot summer days while at the same time being enchanted by the decorations.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The Berggarten ==\n\nThe Berggarten (Mountain Garden) was created in 1666 as a vegetable garden for the Great Garden on a hill north of the Herrenh\u00e4user Castle. Sophia of Hanover later transformed the Berggarten into a garden for exotic plants, and in 1686 a conservatory was erected.\nThe garden once served more than an aesthetic purpose - it was used to experiment with the breeding of plants normally native to southern lands in the northern climate of Lower Saxony. This experiment failed in its attempts to grow rice, but was successful with some other plants such as tobacco and mulberry. As a result, the silkworms located in the nearby city of Hamelin which were used in production of royal silk began to be fed with Herrenh\u00e4user mulberry leaves in 1706. However, this experiment did not pay off long-term: in 1750 the K\u00fcchengarten in the neighboring city of Linden (now a district of the city of Hanover) took over the job of supporting the aristocracy with produce, and the Berggarten has since been exclusively a botanical garden.\nBetween 1817 and 1820, a caretaker's hut was built on the garden's grounds. In 1846, work began on the \"Palm-house\" (Palmenhaus), a conservatory designed by architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves and containing, as the name implies, palm trees. Within five years of its completion in 1849, the building housed the most valuable and extensive collection of palms in all of Europe. Work on the garden's mausoleum, also designed by Laves, lasted from 1842 to 1847; King Ernest Augustus, who died one year after completion, was interred there with his wife Queen Frederica.\nIt was also around this time (1845 to 1846) that walls and fences were added in order to make the Berggarten more secluded. In 1880, a larger building for the palm collection was built. Taking the form of a roughly 30 meter tall palace-like structure, the greenhouse - built out of glass and steel - houses both galleries and decorative fountains and replaced the previous Palmenhaus. Much of the garden had to be rebuilt bit by bit after British air raids destroyed much of the city in World War II. In 1952, the Garden Library - which now houses the garden's management - was built, and in 1957, further members of the Royal Family of Hanover, including King George I of Great Britain and his parents, were interred in the garden's mausoleum, after destruction of the Leineschloss and its chapel during World War II. Among them are the remains of John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg, his daughter Anna Sophie (1670\u20131672), Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Luneburg and his wife Sophia of the Palatinate, their younger son Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany and Princess Charlotte of Clarence (1819\u20131819), daughter of William IV of the United Kingdom. In front of the mausoleum are the graves of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick and his wife Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia.\nThe year 2000 saw the completion of a brand new \"Rainforest-house\" (Regenwaldhaus), partially as a replacement for the legendary Palmenhaus (which was demolished in 1950) and partially for the Expo 2000. Inside is a tropical landscape containing more than plants - different species of tropical butterflies and birds were also incorporated into the environment. Further exhibits of the building include several displays themed gardens.\n\n\n== The Georgengarten ==\n\n\n== Welfengarten ==\n\nThe Welfengarten (Welf Garden) makes up the grounds of the University of Hannover, as the university now uses the gothic revival castle at the garden's centre - Welfenschloss - as its main building. Its construction began in 1857, however, before it was completed, Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866. In the following years the building was accomplished in its present form. In front of the building is a bronze sculpture of the \"Lower Saxony Steed\" (Niedersachsenross) \u2013 the heraldic animal found on the coat of arms of Lower Saxony. The Welfengarten, like the other gardens, was also destroyed during the Second World War, but it was rebuilt specifically as the campus of the university. Although the University has occupied the castle since 1879, it was not until 1961 that Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover sold the Welfengarten to the city of Hanover. He kept however the Princely House (F\u00fcrstenhaus), located near the Great Garden and built by king George I of Great Britain for his daughter Anna Louise in 1720, for himself. His grandson Prince Ernst August of Hanover uses it as his private residence today. The museum in this small palace, with an elaborate furniture collection, has therefore been closed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Germany\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nBotanical Garden - Berggarten\nPictures by Anna Levitskaia (www.levitski.com)\nPrincely House (F\u00fcrstenhaus)",

          "It's really nice to visit! But only in spring or summer. U got a ticket for the museum, which isn't that interesting ( very small and nothing inside) and to the botanical gardens, which is also very nice, specially to take nice pictures. The caf\u00e9 at the gardens is really nice.",

          "If you go to Hannover I would say don't miss this. It is a lovely park that is a peaceful lovely place to stroll. While it says it's patterned after Versailles - I would say that's making it a pretty high expectation and would disappoint you. But if you want to get out into the",

          "Be ready to walk a lot, ad it is a big park full of trees and attractive figures, but will be great to visit it in Spring season, especially the Botanic garden. As we went during winter season (early March), the entrance fee was 3 Euros per person, which i reasonable.",
          "I spent a few hours on my last day in Hannover at these spectacular gardens. I brought some cheese, bread, and apple juice that I purchased from a farmers market on the way. I meandered through the gardens, got lost in the topiary mazes, had my picnic under a tree, and took in",

          "I think we probably visited at the worng time of the year. Interesting and extensive formal gardens but not much in bloom in October. A variety of lakes and water channels but not much birdlife to excite the visiting birder. Easy to get to from the city centre by tram. Some",

          "We liked the whole area, gardens, buildings and especially the plant centre opposite which had numerous orchids and exotic plants to look at. We spent the whole day there as the gardens were so big and the fountains were wonderful to see in action . The combi ticket is value",
          "Maybe I am too young or something to appreciate this, but this place is basically a nice garden - a very well maintained, pretty and large garden - yet, just a garden.The fountains were not running when I was there, I suspect this might have made it a bit cooler.",
          "This is a great place to visit on a nice day. Short drive or easy train ride from the airport. Elegant grounds with statues and well maintained flower beds. The grotto area was spectacular! After my 4 hours there was a Biergarten to enjoy a beer and take in scenery again.",
          "These gardens are well worth a visit especially during spring and summer. They are well laid out and have first class displays. We would go again without hesitation.",
          "Extensive, many fountains, very formal. Don't forget to go to the botanical gardens across the road.",
          "I've been to many formal gardens around Europe. This particular example is one of the best I've ever seen. The fountains are fantastic and, while I am no expert on formal gardens, these have to be among the best in Europe.",
          "The topiary, the roses, the fountains, the tranquility. The best however is the grotto, a modern twist on a very old artificial cave",
          "We went to this exhibition at Herrenhausen which covered the political situation with the Act of Settlement and found it fascinating. We then toured the wonderful gardens and would highly recommend it. Herrenhausen has just been rebuilt after it was destroyed in the war.",
          "A visit to Hannover would not be complete without a visit to Herrenhausen with its palace and gardens. At \u20ac8 for adult entry this is excellent value which includes the Palace, museum, main garden and botanical garden across the road. You can get an audio guide in English for",
          "This is one incredible place to visit. it is amazing! The garden has a maze in the section 4 of the garden, it was pretty exciting, went round the maze and found myself back in the middle of the maze 3 times. There is a museum in the garden and for adult it is 8 euros to get",
          "Didn't cost much to get in, very good value, the gardens are lovely. Didn't seem to be much choice as to where to get food - the restaurant prices were ridiculous, and the only other place was a fast food place next to the Sealife centre which we didn't fancy. I would take a",
          "These are large, beautiful, extremely well maintained formal gardens in easy reach of the centre of Hannover - just take the 4 or 5 subway/tram. A very pleasant way to spend a quiet couple of hours. Plenty of space to wander and enjoy the flowers/trees/plants. Excellent",
          "English people like gardens and so they will like this. Also a museum attached which was interesting and a good book shop id you speak German.",
          "It is the best attraction in Hannover. Gardens with various flowers are very relaxing and the view is beautiful. The first floor of the museum was not interesting but second floor was worth to see. The water show is not a show but a couple of fountains flowing. Tickets are 8",
          "The grotto was really nice, it is all made of little pieces of mirror glass and sculptures are very original",
          "It is a place that you shoud not miss a visit if you are in Hannover. I've visited other royal gardens and I found that this one is worthy to walk and enjoy the barroc atmosphere.",
          "I took the U bahn out to the gardens to see them and arrived to be confronted with a sign saying that they were closing early at 5pm and last admission was at 4pm. It was 4.20 and I asked if I could go in for half an hour to have a look round but the staff were singularly",
          "......but the garden itself will certainly be worth a visit just on it's own.Ticket for the aforementioned party (during approx. 3x4 days each July) seem to be available only in conjunction with a hotel booking. Definitely worth a try....",
          "A fantastic baroque garden, well restored and maintained. The map given with your ticket is inadequate and does not show you the best route to go around, which means there is a lot of retracing of steps. The ticket is valid all day, but make sure you keep it with you or you",
          "These are beautiful gardens - so good I went there twice!!!!!!!! Be warned that the fountains only operate at certain times. these are set out at the entrance. For Brits there is of course the connection to our royal family.",
          "On the day of my visit the gardens were either preparing for, or cleaning up after, a series of shows or exhibitions. Because of this there were half assembled stages everywhere that blocked the views of many gardens and walkways. Many of the fountains were also not working.",
          "We visited the gardens in May this year. They are very very nice and I wouldn't miss then when in Hannover. You should wait for the water fountains to go on, as it's a nice spectacle.",
          "Although the weather was overcast and a bit rainy, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Herrenhauser gardens. The big garden is spectacular, with statues, flowers, and intricately patterned hedges. There are also 8 \"special\" gardens, with different themes. The most impressive",
          "Herrenhausen gardens are wonderful. They're very well kept and clean and you can also feel the peaceful atmosphere.. they're wonderful if you are looking for shade and relax under the trees. Nice the squirrels scurrying everywhere! But it has been a pitty not seeing the big",
          "Brilliant. Well worth a visit even if you are not a horticulturalist. It is such an amazing relaxing space.",
          "The Grossgarten is immaculate - all very neat and tidy and with lots of gardeners working on them, mowing, trimming etc. Inside the big garden are lots of individually themed gardens such as the one with the golden statues and the ones which are miniature mazes. There are many",
          "The main attraction in Hannover and well worth a visit but allow around four or five hours if you want to see it all and be prepared for a lot of walking and to take lots of photgraphs. The Grossgarten is enormous, and very formal, with fountains, statues and thousands of",
          "Visited in early Spring as part of a trip to the CeBIT conference and this place was a great to wind down. Vast open spaces, reasonable entry price and very easy to get to from the main train station. When we went the large fountains were not working but can imagine it would",
          "But is nothing fancy inside. The palace was only recently rebuilt as the original one was destroyed during the war. The gardens are amazing. I had been there previously and they were just as I recalled.",
          "This is such a beautiful place even for those who aren't garden enthusiastics. We spent here half a day walking around, I can only imagine how beautiful this would be once all the roses etc. bloom. Get lostinthe labyrinth and also don't miss the grotte from niki de saint phalle!",
          "Beautiful gardens, wild spaces and water features. Something there for you whether you're a flower gardener or not. Ever been to the cafeteria at a tourist attraction??? Try the eatery here...blows most out of the water..not cheap but almost worth a visit in its own right! I",
          "huge gardens, in 3 parts, don't forget to visit the glasshouses,the inside of the palace is a small museum, the major attraction are the gardens",
          "The gardens are beautiful, and also the old buildings. See also the very interesting mirror rooms. ...",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you are in hannover, heerenhausen is located only a short tram ride.from the city centre on line 4 or 5. Admission during winter is6 euro which gives you access to the whole garden, there was a very popular tropical flowers exhibiton in the green",
          "Been several times over the years. Love especially when there is the international fireworks competition (if you want to save money you can see part of the show also from outside of the Gardens). It's best if you have some sun to enjoy the colours of the plants.",
          "Superb gardens with amazing features - just don't bank on getting around in a couple of hours - it's huge!",
          "I visited in August 2012 with a special friend who was a local so knew the gardens well. We started walking through an area dominated mainly by parkland, so lots of green areas and trees. In the middle of this was a small museum dedicated to a illustrator of a very famous German",
          "Wonderful manicured gardens and the light shows and fireworks during the summer are fabulous. Well worth a visit. The walk back into town througt the park is also do-able - wear comfy shoes.",
          "This is a very pretty place to visit. We started off in the museum and had a look at the artefacts, most had an English translation next to them. This was very interesting and gave a history to the place and Germany around that era. There is a gift shop with nice postcards for",
          "The gardens are beautiful. If you visit when the Royal Fireworks Competition is in session you will be doubly impressed. The competition, usually in May or June (I believe) is fireworks orchestrated to music. One has to think of the Handel Watermusic. The palace area is",
          "If you are going to the international fireworks competition the doors open at about 1830, but you don't need to get there until 2000, and even there you'll have over an hour to wait. By the way beware the fireworks can start up to 15 mins early! Stand in the centre at the back",
          "Although not terribly well signposted, we enjoyed the gardens on both sides of the road and thought it was good value for money, though there are no concessions!",
          "Well worth a visit! Several gardens and a small museum to be seen. Bring lots and lots of time however!",
          "There are 3 big parks - Gross Garden, Berggarten and Georgien Terrassen. The last one is free big park. The 2nd one is very nice Botanic Garden, And the 1st one is very nice park with fountains and sculptures. I like and recommend it very much! If you'd like to visit all of it -",
          "i was alone in hannover for 17 days , it was one of the indescribable places that i have ever visited, the gardens were so amazingly organized with different colors with nice water plays , whenever you want to have some relaxation you should be there for a couple of hours",
          "A place where you can find peace, relax, you can go there with the family , kids or as a couple it is a place where everyone would love and enjoy, you can walk around the gardens have a break lots of benches available, if you wanna read a book or just enjoy the looking around,",
          "If you like gardens you will love these, I chose this location to propose to my now wife on a previous visit, I had not planned to do that but had taken the ring on holiday in the hope of finding the perfect place, I did, the gardens are used for weddings, so when I saw all the",
          "As one who has always loved gardens but never been very interested in gardening, this was a real treat. To step into this fantasy world of sculpted and tamed nature was a perfect way to spend an afternoon in Hannover. I had read that these gardens were like a mini-Versailles,",
          "Very pretty and the water fountains were stunning. Shame they did not have a cafe/restaurant of their own.",
          "Herrenhausen is on the hop on hop off bus tour, so easy to get to. The gardens are really well kept with many fountains, including a huge one similar to the one at Versailles. Indeed the gardens at Versailles were laid out by the gardener who did Herrenhausen - which is more",
          "We took advantage of the wonderful weather to go for a picnic in the extensive well kept gardens. In the past we have been to the outdoor concerts and fireworks displays. This is well worth a visit.",
          "If you go to the Gardens this is a good time to go. Visit the rose garden , a must. See the various roses in bloom. Wonder the vast grounds where at times because of the vastness you think that you are alone.. Finish off in the museum a new addition which includes part of our",
          "Between this and the botanical gardens I spent about 4 hours which for me is amazing. The gardens are set out superbly and have loads of interest. They are well tended and this time of year is brilliant as most of the flowers are out. The attached museum is ok but as you buy a",
          "The guided tour we had of the Baroque gardens was very good but sadly on our visit there was a problem with the water supply and the fountains and cascade were off in the afternoon. The Orchid House and botanical gardens also well worth a look.",
          "The gardens themselves are formal and not too much to my liking, but the Botanical Gardens over the road are great. The combined ticket gives access to both gardens but you can just buy for the botanics for which I give 5 stars and were I in Hannover I'd go again.",
          "The day we visited a lot of the garden was roped off for works and the refreshment stands were closed but we were still charged the full 8EUR fee. Also take cash - they do not accept any UK bank cards and there wasn't a cash point in the vicinity. It was nice to walk around",
          "It was nice to stroll around in those beautiful gardens. Nice to spend there a morning or afternoon.",
          "I'm not much of a gardener but my friend who is a professional gardener thought the botanical gardens were fab. She cooed over the magnolias which were in full bloom. The greenhouses were well labelled and apparently there was adventurous planting and great planning. For the",
          "amazing, how they keep it that well. \u20ac 5 entrance was a bit more then expected. Very close to the city, just a 10 minute ride by tram",
          "I frequently get to Hannover on business and the gardens are always a nice destination to go for a walk and take in the beauty of the surroundings. While I wasn't able to visit the newly built castle during my recent visit, it looks quite interesting and certainly offers",
          "The Herrenhausen Gardens are absolutely beautiful. The Gardens are divided into a variety of gardens types. The central \"Great Garden\" was designed by Electress Sophia and is one of the few remaining original Baroque gardens. These lovely gardens also contain many modern",
          "Great art and fountains are to be found at this place. While I was there in the fall and there was little gardens to be seen, it was still worth it.",
          "Very spacious formal gardens which were a part of the Royal Palace where the Elector of Hannover lived.",
          "Must see is the (yearly) Firework World Championship, otherwise just a regular park for a nice walk.",
          "I was lucky enough to stay beside the gardens and it really is a special place to visit. The gardens are beautifully laid out and awash with colour and the fountains just make it extra special. In the summertime, there are fabulous fireworks at night making this a truly",
          "Easy to get to by tram from the centre. I only visited the gardens (free in winter) and could appreciate how fabulous they are in summer. Many beautiful statues throughout.",
          "Hannover is such a pretty city, there's no shortage of things to do on a sunny weekend afternoon. The royal gardenas are beautiful and host a variety of garden styles as well as fountains and artwork. Great place to visit with the family or on a date.",

          "Amazing gardens!! beautiful and huge! we were lucky enough to be there with a wonderfull sunny day which made everything even nicer! We felt like princess wandering around green spaces, hiden corners, square trees and pretty mix of flowers. Divine !",
          "I visited the garden when there was Fireworks festival.. Garden is simply huge...sometime it feels there is no dead end to it. It has one of the highest fountain in the Europe shooting jests of water for 72 ft into air. It is also is a botanical garden with houses containing",

          "Been there to watch \"A Midsummernights Tale\", musical by HR Kunze, whose stage contructions and lights blended perfectly with the surrounding gardens and summed up to an unforgettable evening!!",
          "Value for Money, variation in the Gardens. Combination of Art and flowers. Plenty of places to sit in the shade.",
          "The best place to be chosen in Hannover to feel the power of nature and the spirit of the locals. Incredibly beautiful gardens, flowers in their best shape, people having fun and enjoying music and their picnics in an adorable way. Don't miss Niki de Phalle Grotte. Something",
          "Quiet gardens. Free to enter during winter, although everything is bear. I came here during spring too. Although there's an entrance fee, it's worth it to see the symmatrical gardens, the fountains and the lovely statues. Very peaceful, and as it's really big, there's heaps of",
          "Just a short underground/u-bahn ride from the railway station. Enormous set of gardens suited for wonderful walking and for fine horticulture and also for botanising. All is finely laid out. And the entrance price is amazingly low (5 euro).",
          "These gardens are divided into two sections. (1) The Grosser Baroque gardens and (2) the Berggarten (Botanical gardens.) They are situated opposite each other and easily reached by a short tram ride (Nos. 4 or 5) from the city of Hannover. The total cost to enter both",
          "An unexpectedly interesting (and cheap) diversion for a morning Make sure you see the fountains",
          "On my first trip to Hannover, I did not have time to see the gardens, so I'm really glad I had the opportunity on my second trip. To see the gardens laid out, so symmetric, definitely takes you back in time, and makes you think about how life was back all those years ago, with",
          "These gardens were wonderful to walk around. But not to be undertaken without lots of energy as they were HUGE. They were like an enormous version of Hampton Court Palace. Without the flowers. Of course there were flowers in the main garden, but once you got away from it,",
          "The gardens are quite large. There is a Nikki st. Phaille grotto which is really amazing. Good restaurant too!",
          "We came to Herrenhausen Gardens bacause we live in Kew Gardens and one of the founders of Kew, Prince Frederick, was brought up in Hannover at Herrenhausen. The main baroque garden is a treat. It is very large and has a number of extremely interesting different areas. It also",
          "Worth a visit when flowers are blooming and make sure you get the combo ticket for the gardens (Berggarten) across the street as well. Street car stop right at the gardens from the town center. Restaurant prices seemed on the high side, not many customers.",
          "Tropical aroma among beautiful flowers and plants. Nice moments for friends and families, including children.",
          "I went to the gardens for my first time just as winter was ending. It was okay at best. The fountains were turned off and everything was still brown and gray with only the faintest hints of green. I went back in the summer of the same year. What a change! Suddenly, everything",
          "The Herrenhausen Gardens are one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe with the baroque Great Garden, the botanical garden Berggarten (with a wonderful permanent orchid exhibition) and the Georgengarten, a romantic landscape garden. Herrenhausen is always worth a visit!!!",
          "It is not great in the winter, but in the summer Hannover is light until close to midnight so go to the gardens around 2100 or so and you will have a great time. Beautiful and this is THE start of what is today the House of Hannover of Great Britain.",
          "These parks are well-tended, with Georgen Garten being the \"English\" style, laid out paths, with lawns, plantings and small lakes, ponds and canals. Inside the park is the William Busch museum, you'll find reviews elsewhere and at one end of the avenue of trees is a small",
          "Beautiful place to spend an hour or two any time of year",
          "I had only a couple of hours to spend in the gardens but it was enough time to thoroughly enjoy an overview of them all (if i had more time and the weather was warmer i would probably enjoy spending more time there). The gardens are very well kept and I would especially",
          "The gardens are really lovely, but the greenhouses are absolutelly first line.The orchid collection is large and includes most rare and exotic species.I could have stayed there for hours.",
          "I loved both the Great Garden and the Berggarten- they are both absolutely beautiful! There is even a section of the Berggarten that features the native flowers of northern Germany. In addition, this was the perfect time of year to go. I also suggest 1. purchasing the 4 euro"

        "wiki": "The  Roter Faden (Red Thread) in Hannover is a circuit to 36 important points of interest concerning architecture and the history of the city centre in Hannover.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Red Thread is a 4.2 kilometre long line, which marks the pavement using red colour. The line follows pedestrian ways and crosses numerous streets. The line starts at Ernst-August-Platz next to the Tourist Information opposite the main train station and ends at the equestrian statue of former king Ernst August right in front of the main train station. The course of the Red Line is continuously barrier free. The line is renewed every year using about 70 litres of red colour.\nThe Red Thread has its own brochure, created by the Hannover Marketing und Tourismus GmbH, in which each station is explained. This brochure is also available in 10 different languages (see Literature). There is also an app \"Roter Faden\" available for iOS offering 4 languages.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe \"Roter Faden\" was created in 1971 during a marketing campaign which the D\u00fcsseldorfer Agentur Gerstner, Gredinger & Kutter (GGK) developed for the city of Hannover. The agency had been chosen in 1969 by city manager Martin Neuffer. At that time Hannover had a reputation of being one of the most boring cities in Germany. Appreciating art, city manager Neuffer initiated an image campaign using two components: a street art program and the Hannover marketing. The idea was since copied by some other cities.\n\n\n== Stations of the Roter Faden ==\nTourist information next to the main train station\nGalerie Luise\nThe Opera\nGeorgstra\u00dfe\nGeorgsplatz\nAround the Aegidientor\nAegidien Church\n\u201eSiebenm\u00e4nnerstein\u201c (Spartanerstein) next to Aegidien church\nRemains of the town wall and \"Kubus\" art gallery (Theodor-Lessing-Platz)\nThe archer on Trammplatz next to the new city hall\nNew City Hall\nMuseum August Kestner\nThe portal with coat of arms decoration next to the city administration\nLaveshaus, former home to the architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves\nWangenheimpalais\nWaterloos\u00e4ule and state archives\n\"About water art and und river gods\" on the river Leine (see G\u00f6ttinger Sieben)\nSchlo\u00dfbr\u00fccke next to Leineschloss\nHohes Ufer (Beginenturm)\nNanas by Niki de Saint Phalle (street art in Hannover, peddlers market)\nEntering the Altstadt through the Marstalltor\nHannovers oldest town house (Burgstra\u00dfe 12)\nThe Kreuzkirche\nJohann Duve \u2013 entrepreneur (Duvekapelle next to the Kreuzkirche)\nBallhof, Hannovers oldest sports hall\nHistorisches Museum\nLeineschloss, seat of the Landtag of Lower Saxony\nLeibnizhaus am Holzmarkt\nIn the heart of the historic city (Altstadt): Timber framed buildings and pubs\nMarktkirche\nAltes Rathaus\nFratzenkopf relief at the fa\u00e7ade of the Old City Hall\nMarkthalle\nCity \u2013 the shopping area\nKr\u00f6pcke\nUnterm Schwanz: popular meeting point in front of the Hauptbahnhof at the Ernst August equestrian statue\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDer Rote Faden, Hannover Marketing und Tourismus GmbH, Hannover 2010\nWelche Nana steht auf dem Kopf?, book and quiz by Klaus Lange, Hannover Juni 2011, EAN 4260225070134\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial page for the Roter Faden\nDer \u201eBlaue Faden\u201c\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Maschsee is an artificial lake situated south of the city centre of Hanover in Germany. Spanning an area of 78 hectares, it is the largest body of water within the capital of Lower Saxony. The lake is a popular recreation area as well as a venue for numerous water sports.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the lake stems from the so-called \u201cLeinemarsch\u201c, or simply \u201dMarsch\u201c, meaning swamp. This is the historical description for the area in which the lake was built, that was in a deep-lying floodplain of the River Leine.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\n\n=== Design ===\nIt was first considered to create a lake in the wide river valley of the River Leine near Hanover during the late 19th century. This tied in with the by-then necessary dyking of the River Leine and the River Ihme, which would regularly flood the city after snow melted in the Harz Mountains in spring. The creation of a lake could reduce the threat of high water levels and put the Leine's river valley area to better use.\nIn the course of the decades there were further, very different designs: Small solutions and larger ones, which envisaged the Sch\u00fctzenplatz (shooting range) as an island in the lake. In September 1925 the newly elected city mayor Arthur Menge commissioned Otto Franzius, a water engineer and professor at the Hanover Technical College (now Leibniz University Hannover), to work out the details of the construction of a lake together with the city's building authorities. Franzius was to be responsible for the designing of the hydro-engineering and hydrological elements of the project, while the city authorities, led by Karl Elkart, would handle the urban development aspects.\nIn contrast to the original idea that the lake be dug down into swamp land and then be supplied with water by the Leine, a new proposal emerged to build the Maschsee atop the swamp in a bowl-like structure \u2013 raising it higher than the water level of the Leine \u2013 and having it be filled using a system of water pumps. This would eradicate the problem of a potential accumulation of mud through flood waters.\nFranzius created a final design that proved both effective and financially acceptable, whereupon the city authorities provided a grant of 14,000 Reichsmarks in January 1926 toward attempts to seal the basin of the proposed lake.\nDespite the plans being completed it nevertheless took roughly eight years until the beginning of the 1930s for work to commence. The three main factors behind the creation of an artificial lake in the River Leine\u2019s river valley were:\n\nThe embankment of the River Ihme\u2019s flood channel\nThe creation of a local recreation area close to the city that provided the opportunity for water sports\nThe elimination of high unemployment levels (1932: 58,000 Hanoverians) through programmes of public works.One factor against construction of the lake was the nearly 20-metre-high (66 ft) Bismarck Tower which stood in the centre of the proposed water feature. Here, paramilitary marches took place and it was the site of a book burning in 1933. The landmark was eventually demolished in 1935 during the course of the lake's construction.\n\n\n=== Job creation ===\nIn the 1930s, the era of the Great Depression, the city of Hanover lacked the necessary finance for the commencement of the Maschsee project, even though the project had already been planned some ten years earlier. The project was favourable for the Nazi Party that came to power in January 1933 as it would help reduce unemployment levels, which was a central theme of their propaganda. On 28 November 1933 the project was approved at a meeting of the city council.\nOn 21 March 1934 the first ground was broken in the Leine swamp. Despite the unsettled financing of the project, it provided many people with work. Driven by the harshness of the economic situation of the time, they took on tough working conditions and low pay which was barely much higher than unemployment support.\nDuring construction fourteen locomotive trains with 365 tipping wagons were used along a 15 km track as well as diggers and five crawler tractors. Many workers though had to supply their own tools. Initially there were 100 people working on the project, but by its completion 1,650 people had been involved to excavate roughly 780,000 square metres of earth to create the lake basin.\nWith the Maschsee project fully completed by early 1936, the official opening took place on 21 May 1936. Hundreds of thousands of Hanoverians and guests looked on from the edge of the lake as the event began with the then-typical trooping of the Nazi Party. In addition some 6,000 sporting persons took part in a rally along with the armed forces and public officials.\nDuring World War II the lake was covered up with canvasses and fake landscapes created on floating islands created, in an attempt to confuse Allied bomber pilots of their whereabouts during air raids on Hanover.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water level loses a maximum of 1.3 centimetres per day through evaporation and water seepage, which equates to 10,000 cubic metres of water. In order to maintain a constant level, a pump station at a series of ponds in Ricklingen provides the Maschsee with a water supply. Its three pumps send water along an 800-metre-long (2,600 ft) pipe to the \"source\" of the Maschsee. Depending on weather conditions, between 1-2 million m3 of water are required. From November until February no pumping is carried out, so the water level sinks on average 45 cm during this time.\n\nUntil 1960 the Maschsee's water level was supplied by the \"Maschsee Source\" pump station. Its pumping and filtering houses were one of the first building projects at the site of the lake to be put into operation in November 1935. The plant is equipped with two pumps which are capable of raising 500 litres of water every second from the River Leine.\nAs the Leine is strongly contaminated with suspended sediment, the usage of this water supply meant that the Maschsee quickly began to silt up. The Hanover city administration therefore decided in 1960 to build the new pump station at the Ricklingen Ponds, in order to supply the lake with groundwater.\nThe old pumping house is only active today if the oxygen content of the water is too low, as this water is supplied to the lake through an open-air three-stage cascading system that raises oxygen levels. It is also put into use during the Maschseefest.\nToday the old pumping house is used as a club house by the Hanover Sport Club.\n\n\n== Leisure activities ==\n\n\n=== Maschseefest ===\nEvery summer the Maschseefest is held over several weeks beside the lake, which draws around two million visitors annually. The event was first staged in 1986 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Maschee's opening. It features musical performances, cabaret, cuisine and firework displays.\n\n\n=== Boats and ships ===\nDuring the summer months the Hanoverian transport company \u00fcstra operates boat trips on the lake using electrically powered vessels. Surrounding the Maschsee are numerous clubs for water sports (most popularly, rowing and sailing). During the year many diverse competitions are held on the lake, including the annual European Dragon Boat Race.\nBetween 1952 and 1989 motor boat competitions were regularly staged on the lake, which saw four world championships contested and ten European champions crowned.\n\n\n=== Bathing ===\nThe Maschsee Beach lies at the southern point of the lake. The former city open air pool was handed over by the city to a private investor in 2005. They began construction on an expensive commercial \u201cwellness park\u201c, whereupon the project stalled. In 2007 the investor group Aspria took over and continued the work.\nIn spring 2009 Aspria Hannover opened a private spa and sport club in the buildings of the old public facilities and some newly built premises. Aspria also took over the running of the public bathing area though since 2009 over half of the bathing area is only accessible to members of the private Aspria club.\n\n\n=== Exercising ===\nWith its proximity to the centre of Hanover, the Maschsee is a popular recreation area for the city's walkers and joggers. In 2005 a 6 km long route around the lake was mapped out by the German Athletics Association. This track runs along the footpath, closer to the water than the asphalt-coated cycle path. Since 2003 the cycle path has also been open for roller skating usage.\n\n\n=== Ice activities ===\n\nIf the lake freezes in Winter with the thickness of the ice exceeding 13 cm, then the city authorities hoist a flag at the northern shore of the lake to indicate that it is permitted to go onto the ice. In periods of constant cold weather the lake can draw more than 10,000 visitors a day for activities such as ice skating and ice hockey. If the ice thickness reaches 20 cm then stalls can even be erected upon the ice too; this last occurred in 2003.\n\n\n== Art works ==\nNotable works of art on the northern side of the lake are the 6-metre-high (20 ft) red steel \"Hellebardier\" sculpture by Alexander Calder (1972) as well as the bronze Olympic torchbearer that stands atop an 18.5-metre-high (61 ft) stone column and \"Putto on the Fish\" that were both created by Hermann Scheuernstuhl (1936).\nOther sculptures on the eastern side are the \"Menschenpaar\" by Georg Kolbe (1936\u201337) and two lion sculptures created by Arno Breker (1938). In 1948 Erich Haberland unveiled his piece \"The Swimmer\", which stands in the public bathing area.\nSpanish artist Santiago Sierra caused a sensation in 2005 when he remembered the fact that the Maschsee was built through a Nazi work programme by installing a walk-in room filled with mud at the Kestner Society Art Gallery.\nA light art project was held around the lake at the start of 2009 under the title \"New Moon on the Lake\". The display consisted of 22 illuminated pieces that had been created by international artists, which formed the opening of the 2009 Garden Project in Hanover.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Accessibility ==\n\nThe Maschsee lies close to such other notable places as the New City Hall, the Lower Saxony State Museum, the Sprengel Museum, the AWD-Arena (home of the football club Hannover 96), the main city indoor swimming pool as well as the Lower Saxony broadcasting houses of television channels NDR and ZDF.\nThe lake is directly accessible by using the bus stops at the AWD Arena and the Sprengel Museum. Additional bus and tram stops such as the Aegidientorplatz, Schl\u00e4gerstra\u00dfe, Geibelstra\u00dfe, Altenbekener Damm and D\u00f6hren Tower also lie in relatively close proximity to the lake.\nNumerous foot and cycle paths lead to the Maschsee and follow along its shoreline. The western side of the lake, where the club houses of numerous water sport clubs are situated, is only accessible by foot or cycle as vehicles are not permitted without official permission.\n\n\n== References ==\nPress Office, City of Hanover (1936).

        "wiki": "Celle Castle (German: Schloss Celle) or, less commonly, Celle Palace, in the German town of Celle in Lower Saxony, was one of the residences of the House of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. This quadrangular building is the largest castle in the southern L\u00fcneburg Heath region.\n\n\n== History ==\nCelle Castle is based on a fortified wall tower (Wehrturm) with the character of a water castle, that guarded a ford over the River Aller. This first fortification, called Kellu, was built by a Brunonen count around 980 AD. Another forerunner of the castle, which may have been an extension of the wall tower, was founded in 1292 by Otto the Strict. The cellar vault and the lower stories of the watch tower have survived to the present day. Its ruins lie underneath the castle theatre. Around 1315 the actual Castrum Celle was first recorded. As a consequence of the War of the L\u00fcneburg Succession, in 1378 the Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg moved their Residenz from L\u00fcneburg to  Celle and began transforming the Burg, now encircled by ditches and embankments, into a Schloss. About a century later the castle was further expanded by Frederick the Pious from 1471\u20131478, and the castle chapel was consecrated in 1485. Ernest I the Confessor had the castle decorated from 1530 in the Renaissance style. At the same time, between 1520 and 1560, the defences, in the form of ramparts and bastions, were pushed further out. At this time the castle was typical of its era, a quadrangular building with a rectangular courtyard, with massive corner towers, a large main tower and characteristic features of Weser Renaissance.\n\nFrom 1670 onwards alterations to the castle were carried out by Duke George William, which were intended to transform the old renaissance seat into a contemporary Residenz. George William was keen on building, typical of the princes of his time, and made further changes that were intended to recall his time in Italy. The fa\u00e7ades, that were copied from Venetian buildings, were then given their present-day appearance. Notable features include the corona of gables that encircles the roofs, and the unusual shape of the domed towers. The addition of the castle theatre and the Baroque state rooms stem from this period.\n\nOn the death of George William in 1705 the absolute rule of the dukes ended. The Principality of L\u00fcneburg subsequently passed, along with the Principality of Calenberg, to the Kingdom of Hanover. The castle lost its political significance and stood empty again for a long time. From 1772 it was occupied by the British-born Danish queen, Caroline Matilda, the daughter of Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales, who had been banished to Celle as a result of her affair with Johann Friedrich Struensee of Copenhagen. The unhappy queen only lived at the Celle court until 1775, when she died at a relatively young age of scarlet fever. In the 19th century the castle was occasionally used by the Hanoverian royal household as a summer residence. As a result, Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves had several interior alterations made in 1839 and 1840. During World War I, it was used as a detention camp for officers (Offizerslager or Oflag) by the German Army.\n\n\n=== The castle today ===\nThe castle still has a variety of rooms and halls that date back over different periods. The court chapel was converted after the Reformation and has been preserved almost unchanged with its renaissance architecture. The baroque-style state rooms were created under George William and have also been preserved. In the Gothic Hall there are constantly changing exhibitions and in the East Wing is a section of Celle's Bomann Museum, which is dedicated to the history of the Kingdom of Hanover. The historic castle rooms and the castle chapel, restored between 1978 and 1981, may be visited as part of a guided tour.\n\n\n== Castle Theatre ==\nThe court theatre of the castle, the Schlosstheater Celle, is one of the oldest preserved theatres of its kind and one of the few baroque theatres in North Germany. It still has its own theatre company today.\nThe present Schlosstheater was built on the instigation of Duke George William, who before he came to power spent some time in Venice and came to know Italian opera whilst he was there. The theatre was designed by the Italian architect Giuseppe Arighini. Construction work on the theatre began in 1670 and was largely finished by 1675. The duke hosted a succession of theatre companies, that he recruited, for example, from France, Italy and also nearby Hanover. On the death of the duke the theatre became orphaned until the short-lived stay of Caroline Matilda, for whom the theatre was given a second gallery.\nThe theatre was conceived for the benefit of the court and was never intended to be open to the public, who were first allowed a moderate degree of access to plays at the end of the 18th century. The theatre was regularly used until the late 19th century, but was closed in 1890 and fell into disuse. In 1935 it underwent a thorough renovation.\n\n\n== Castle Park ==\n\nBecause the castle was never used for any military purposes, between 1785 and 1802 the outer bastions were dismantled and used as fill for the once deep, wide castle moats. In 1826 gardens were laid out in the vicinity of the castle by levelling and removing the defensive embankments. In their place, trees and shrubs were planted and lawns laid. In the 19th century a landscape garden was created in the area immediately surrounding the castle. Since part of the park was given away for building residential accommodation around 1900, the park has retained an area of about 7 hectares (17 acres). The castle still sits on an island today that is surrounded by moats.\nOutside the former defensive belt, but not far from the castle, George William had the French Garden (\"Franz\u00f6sischer Garten\"), a baroque park designed on French lines, laid out in the late 17th century. This was later converted to an English landscape garden, but the former baroque layout can still be made out in certain areas of the park.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHorst Masuch: Das Schlo\u00df in Celle.

        "wiki": "Bergen-Belsen [\u02c8b\u025b\u0281\u0261n\u0329.b\u025blsn\u0329], or Belsen, was a Nazi concentration camp in what is today Lower Saxony in northern Germany, southwest of the town of Bergen near Celle. Originally established as a prisoner of war camp, in 1943, parts of it became a concentration camp. Initially this was an \"exchange camp\", where Jewish hostages were held with the intention of exchanging them for German prisoners of war held overseas. The camp was later expanded to accommodate Jews from other concentration camps.\nAfter 1945 the name was applied to the displaced persons camp established nearby, but it is most commonly associated with the concentration camp. From 1941 to 1945, almost 20,000 Soviet prisoners of war and a further 50,000 inmates died there. Overcrowding, lack of food and poor sanitary conditions caused outbreaks of typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and dysentery, leading to the deaths of more than 35,000 people in the first few months of 1945, shortly before and after the liberation.\nThe camp was liberated on April 15, 1945, by the British 11th Armoured Division. The soldiers discovered approximately 60,000 prisoners inside, most of them half-starved and seriously ill, and another 13,000 corpses lying around the camp unburied. The horrors of the camp, documented on film and in pictures, made the name \"Belsen\" emblematic of Nazi crimes in general for public opinion in many countries in the immediate post-1945 period. Today, there is a memorial with an exhibition hall at the site.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\n\n=== Prisoner of war camp ===\n\nIn 1935 the Wehrmacht began to build a large military complex close to the village of Belsen, a part of the town of Bergen, in what was then the Province of Hanover. This became the largest military training area in Germany of the time and was used for armoured vehicle training. The barracks were finished in 1937. The camp has been in continuous operation since then and is today known as Bergen-Hohne Training Area. It is used by the NATO armed forces.\nThe workers who constructed the original buildings were housed in camps near Fallingbostel and Bergen, the latter being the so-called Bergen-Belsen Army Construction Camp. Once the military complex was completed in 1938/39, the workers' camp fell into disuse. However, after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Wehrmacht began using the huts as a prisoner of war (POW) camp.\nThe camp of huts near Fallingbostel became known as Stalag XI-B and was to become one of the Wehrmacht's largest POW camps, holding up to 95,000 prisoners from various countries. In June 1940, Belgian and French POWs were housed in the former Bergen-Belsen construction workers' camp. This installation was significantly expanded from June 1941, once Germany prepared to invade the Soviet Union, becoming an independent camp known as Stalag XI-C (311). It was intended to hold up to 20,000 Soviet POWs and was one of three such camps in the area. The others were at Oerbke (Stalag XI-D (321)) and Wietzendorf (Stalag X-D (310)). By the end of March 1942, some 41,000 Soviet POWs had died in these three camps of starvation, exhaustion, and disease. By the end of the war, the total number of dead had increased to 50,000. When the POW camp in Bergen ceased operation in early 1945, as the Wehrmacht handed it over to the SS, the cemetery contained over 19,500 dead Soviet prisoners.\nIn the summer of 1943, Stalag XI-C (311) was dissolved and Bergen-Belsen became a branch camp of Stalag XI-B. It served as the hospital for all Soviet POWs in the region until January 1945. Other inmates/patients were Italian military internees from August 1944 and, following the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising in October 1944, around 1,000 members of the Polish Home Army were imprisoned in a separate section of the POW camp.\n\n\n=== Concentration camp ===\nIn April 1943, a part of the Bergen-Belsen camp was taken over by the SS Economic-Administration Main Office (SS Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA). It thus became part of the concentration camp system, run by the SS Schutzstaffel but it was a special case. Having initially been designated a Zivilinterniertenlager (\"civilian internment camp\"), in June 1943 it was redesignated Aufenthaltslager (\"holding camp\"), since the Geneva Conventions stipulated that the former type of facility must be open to inspection by international committees. This \"holding camp\" or \"exchange camp\" was for Jews who were intended to be exchanged for German civilians interned in other countries, or for hard currency. The SS divided this camp into subsections for individual groups (the \"Hungarian camp\", the \"special camp\" for Polish Jews, the \"neutrals camp\" for citizens of neutral countries and the \"Star camp\" for Dutch Jews). Between the summer of 1943 and December 1944 at least 14,600 Jews, including 2,750 children and minors were transported to the Bergen-Belsen \"holding\" or exchange camp. Inmates were made to work, many of them in the \"shoe commando\" which salvaged usable pieces of leather from shoes collected and brought to the camp from all over Germany and occupied Europe. In general the prisoners of this part of the camp were treated less harshly than some other classes of Bergen-Belsen prisoner until fairly late in the war, due to their perceived potential exchange value. However, only around 2,560 Jewish prisoners were ever actually released from Bergen-Belsen and allowed to leave Germany.In March 1944, part of the camp was redesignated as an Erholungslager (\"recovery camp\"), where prisoners too sick to work were brought from other concentration camps. They were in Belsen supposedly to recover and then return to their original camps and resume work, but many of them died in Belsen of disease, starvation, exhaustion and lack of medical attention.In August 1944, a new section was created and this became the so-called \"women's camp\". By November 1944 this camp received around 9,000 women and young girls. Most of those who were able to work stayed only for a short while and were then sent on to other concentration camps or slave-labour camps. The first women interned there were Poles, arrested after the failed Warsaw Uprising. Others were Jewish women from Poland or Hungary, transferred from Auschwitz. Margot and Anne Frank died there in February or March 1945.\n\n\n=== More prisoners ===\nIn December 1944 SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Josef Kramer, previously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, became the new camp commandant, replacing SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Adolf Haas, who had been in post since the spring of 1943. In January 1945, the SS took over the POW hospital and increased the size of Bergen-Belsen. As eastern concentration camps were evacuated before the advance of the Red Army, at least 85,000 people were transported in cattle cars or marched to Bergen-Belsen. Before that the number of prisoners at Belsen had been much smaller. In July 1944 there were 7,300; by December 1944 the number had increased to 15,000; and by February 1945 it had risen to 22,000. Numbers then soared to around 60,000 by April 15, 1945. This overcrowding led to a vast increase in deaths from disease: particularly typhus, as well as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, dysentery and malnutrition in a camp originally designed to hold about 10,000 inmates. At this point also, the special status of the exchange prisoners no longer applied. All inmates were subject to starvation and epidemics.\n\n\n=== Au\u00dfenlager (satellite camps) ===\nBergen-Belsen concentration camp had three satellite camps. These were at regional armament works. Around 2,000 female concentration camp prisoners were forced to work there. Those who were too weak or sick to continue with their work were brought to Bergen-Belsen.Au\u00dfenlager Bomlitz-Benefeld at Bomlitz near Fallingbostel was in use from September 3 to October 15, 1944. It was located at the facility of Eibia GmbH, a gunpowder works. Around 600 female Polish Jews were used for construction and production work.Au\u00dfenlager Hamb\u00fchren-Ovelg\u00f6nne (Lager III, Waldeslust) at Hamb\u00fchren south of Winsen was in use from August 23, 1944 to February 4, 1945. It was an abandoned potash mine, now intended as an underground production site for Bremen plane manufacturer Focke-Wulf. Around 400 prisoners, mostly female Polish or Hungarian Jews, were forced to prepare the facility and to help lay train tracks to it. This was done for the company Hochtief.Au\u00dfenlager Unterl\u00fc\u00df-Altensothrieth (Tannenberglager) east of Bergen was in use from late August 1944 to April 13, 1945. It was located at Unterl\u00fc\u00df, where the Rheinmetall-Borsig AG had a large test site. Up to 900 female Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Yugoslavian and Czech Jews had to clear forest, do construction work or work in munitions production.Prisoners were guarded by SS staff and received no wages for their work. The companies instead reimbursed the SS for the labour supplied. Wage taxes were also levied by local authorities.\n\n\n=== Treatment of prisoners and deaths in the camp ===\n\n \nCurrent estimates put the number of prisoners who passed through the concentration camp during its period of operation from 1943 to 1945 at around 120,000. Due to the destruction of the camp's files by the SS, not even half of them, around 55,000, are known by name. As mentioned above, treatment of prisoners by the SS varied between individual sections of the camp, with the inmates of the exchange camp generally being better treated than other prisoners, at least initially. However, in October 1943 the SS selected 1,800 men and women from the Sonderlager (\"special camp\"), Jews from Poland who held passports from Latin American countries. Since the governments of these nations mostly refused to honour the passports, these people had lost their value to the regime. Under the pretext of sending them to a fictitious \"Lager Bergau\", the SS had them transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were sent directly to the gas chambers and killed. In February and May 1944 another 350 prisoners from the \"special camp\" were sent to Auschwitz. Thus, out of the total of 14,600 prisoners in the exchange camp, at least 3,550 died, more than 1,400 of them at Belsen, and around 2,150 at Auschwitz.In the M\u00e4nnerlager (the male section of the \"recovery camp\"), inmates suffered even more from lack of care, malnourishment, disease and mistreatment by the guards. Thousands of them died. In the summer of 1944, at least 200 men were killed by orders of the SS by being injected with phenol.There were no gas chambers at Bergen-Belsen, since the mass killings took place in the camps further east. Nevertheless, current estimates put the number of deaths at Belsen at more than 50,000 Jews, Czechs, Poles, anti-Nazi Christians, homosexuals, and Roma and Sinti (Gypsies). Among them was Czech painter and writer Josef \u010capek (estimated to be in April 1945). He had coined the word robot, popularised by his brother Karel \u010capek.\nThe rate at which inmates died at Belsen accelerated notably after the mass transport of prisoners from other camps began in December 1944. From 1943 to the end of 1944 around 3,100 died. From January to mid-April 1945 this rose to around 35,000. Another 14,000 died after liberation between April 15 and the end of June 1945 (see below).\nAfter the war, there were allegations that the camp (or possibly a section of it), was \"of a privileged nature\", compared to others. A lawsuit filed by the Jewish community in Thessaloniki against 55 alleged collaborators claims that 53 of them were sent to Bergen-Belsen \"as a special favor\" granted by the Germans.\n\n\n== Liberation ==\n\nWhen the British and Canadians advanced on Bergen-Belsen in 1945, the German army negotiated a truce and exclusion zone around the camp to prevent the spread of typhus. On April 11, 1945 Heinrich Himmler (the Reichsf\u00fchrer SS) agreed to have the camp handed over without a fight. SS guards ordered prisoners to bury some of the dead. The next day, Wehrmacht representatives approached the British and were brought to VIII Corps. At around 1 a.m. on April 13, an agreement was signed, designating an area of 48 square kilometers (19 square miles) around the camp as a neutral zone. Most of the SS were allowed to leave. Only a small number of SS men and women, including the camp commandant Kramer, remained to \"uphold order inside the camp\". The outside was guarded by Hungarian and regular German troops. Due to heavy fighting near Winsen and Walle, the British were unable to reach Bergen-Belsen on April 14, as originally planned. The camp was liberated on the afternoon of April 15, 1945. The first two to reach the camp were a British Special Air Service officer, Lieutenant John Randall, and his jeep driver, who were on a reconnaissance mission and discovered the camp by chance.When British and Canadian troops finally entered they found over 13,000 unburied bodies and (including the satellite camps) around 60,000 inmates, most acutely sick and starving. The prisoners had been without food or water for days before the Allied arrival, partially due to allied bombing. Immediately before and after liberation, prisoners were dying at around 500 per day, mostly from typhus. The scenes that greeted British troops were described by the BBC's Richard Dimbleby, who accompanied them:\n\n...Here over an acre of ground lay dead and dying people. You could not see which was which... The living lay with their heads against the corpses and around them moved the awful, ghostly procession of emaciated, aimless people, with nothing to do and with no hope of life, unable to move out of your way, unable to look at the terrible sights around them ... Babies had been born here, tiny wizened things that could not live ... A mother, driven mad, screamed at a British sentry to give her milk for her child, and thrust the tiny mite into his arms, then ran off, crying terribly. He opened the bundle and found the baby had been dead for days.\nThis day at Belsen was the most horrible of my life.\nInitially lacking sufficient manpower, the British allowed the Hungarians to remain in charge and only commandant Kramer was arrested. Subsequently, SS and Hungarian guards shot and killed some of the starving prisoners who were trying to get their hands on food supplies from the store houses. The British started to provide emergency medical care, clothing and food.  Immediately following the liberation, revenge killings took place in the satellite camp the SS had created in the area of the army barracks that later became Hohne-Camp. Around 15,000 prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora had been relocated there in early April. These prisoners were in much better physical condition than most of the others. Some of these men turned on those who had been their overseers at Mittelbau. About 170 of these \"Kapos\" were killed on April 15, 1945. On April 20, four German fighter planes attacked the camp, damaging the water supply and killing three British medical orderlies.Over the next days the surviving prisoners were deloused and moved to a nearby German Panzer army camp, which became the Bergen-Belsen DP (displaced persons) camp. Over a period of four weeks, almost 29,000 of the survivors were moved there. Before the handover, the SS had managed to destroy the camp's administrative files, thereby eradicating most written evidence.The British forced the former SS camp personnel to help bury the thousands of dead bodies in mass graves. Some civil servants from Celle and Landkreis Celle were brought to Belsen and confronted with the crimes committed on their doorstep. Military photographers and cameramen of No. 5 Army Film and Photographic Unit documented the conditions in the camp and the measures of the British Army to ameliorate them. Many of the pictures they took and the films they made from April 15 to June 9, 1945 were published or shown abroad. Today, the originals are in the Imperial War Museum. These documents had a lasting impact on the international perception and memory of Nazi concentration camps to this day. According to Habbo Knoch, head of the institution that runs the memorial today: \"Bergen-Belsen [...] became a synonym world-wide for German crimes committed during the time of Nazi rule.\"Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was then burned to the ground by flamethrowing \"Bren gun\" carriers and Churchill Crocodile tanks because of the typhus epidemic and louse infestation. As the concentration camp ceased to exist at this point, the name Belsen after this time refers to events at the Bergen-Belsen DP camp.There were massive efforts to help the survivors with food and medical treatment, led by Brigadier Glyn Hughes, Deputy Director of Medical Services of 2nd Army, and James Johnston, the Senior Medical Officer. Despite their efforts, about another 9,000 died in April, and by the end of June 1945 another 4,000 had died. (After liberation 13,994 people died.)Two specialist teams were dispatched from Britain to deal with the feeding problem. The first, led by A. P. Meiklejohn, included 96 medical student volunteers from London teaching hospitals who were later credited with significantly reducing the death rate amongst prisoners. A research team led by Dr Janet Vaughan was dispatched by the Medical Research Council to test the effectiveness of various feeding regimes.\nThe British troops and medical staff tried these diets to feed the prisoners, in this order:\nBully beef from Army rations. Most of the prisoners' digestive systems were in too weak a state from long-term starvation to handle such food.\nSkimmed milk. The result was a bit better, but still far from acceptable.\nBengal Famine Mixture. This is a rice-and-sugar-based mixture which had achieved good results after the Bengal famine of 1943, but it proved less suitable to Europeans than to Bengalis because of the differences in the food to which they were accustomed. Adding the common ingredient paprika to the mixture made it more palatable to these people and recovery started.Some were too weak to even consume the Bengal Famine Mixture. Intravenous feeding was attempted but abandoned \u2013 SS doctors had previously used injections to murder prisoners so some became hysterical at the sight of the intravenous feeding equipment.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Legal prosecution ===\n\nMany of the former SS staff who survived the typhus epidemic were tried by the British at the Belsen trial. Over the period in which Bergen-Belsen operated as a concentration camp, at least 480 people had worked as guards or members of the commandant's staff, including around 45 women. From September 17 to November 17, 1945, 45 of those were tried by a military tribunal in L\u00fcneburg. They included former commandant Josef Kramer, 16 other SS male members, 16 female SS guards and 12 former kapos (one of whom became ill during the trial). Among them were Irma Grese, Elisabeth Volkenrath, Hertha Ehlert, Ilse Lothe, Johanna Bormann and Fritz Klein. Many of the defendants were not just charged with crimes committed at Belsen but also earlier ones at Auschwitz. Their activities at other concentration camps such as Mittelbau-Dora, Ravensbr\u00fcck, Neuengamme, the Gross Rosen subcamps at Neusalz and Langenleuba, and the Mittelbau-Dora subcamp at Gross Werther were not subject of the trial. It was based on British military law and the charges were thus limited to war crimes. Substantial media coverage of the trial provided the German and international public with detailed information on the mass killings at Belsen as well as on the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau.Eleven of the defendants were sentenced to death. They included Kramer, Volkenrath and Klein. The executions by hanging took place on December 13, 1945 in Hamelin. Fourteen defendants were acquitted (one was excluded from the trial due to illness). Of the remaining 19, one was sentenced to life in prison but he was executed for another crime. Eighteen were sentenced to prison for periods of one to 15 years; however, most of these sentences were subsequently reduced significantly on appeals or pleas for clemency. By June 1955, the last of those sentenced in the Belsen trial had been released. Nine other members of the Belsen personnel were tried by later military tribunals in 1946 and 1948.Denazification courts were created by the Allies to try members of the SS and other Nazi organisations. Between 1947 and 1949 these courts initiated proceedings against at least 46 former SS staff at Belsen. Around half of these were discontinued, mostly because the defendants were considered to have been forced to join the SS. Those who were sentenced received prison terms of between four and 36 months or were fined. As the judges decided to count the time the defendants had spent in Allied internment towards the sentence, the terms were considered to have already been fully served.Only one trial was ever held by a German court for crimes committed at Belsen, at Jena in 1949; the defendant was acquitted. More than 200 other SS members who were at Belsen have been known by name but never had to stand trial. No Wehrmacht soldier was ever put on trial for crimes committed against the inmates of the POW camps at Bergen-Belsen and in the region around it, despite the fact that the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg had found in 1946 that the treatment of Soviet POWs by the Wehrmacht constituted a war crime.\n\n\n=== Memorial ===\n\nThe area of the former Bergen-Belsen camp fell into neglect after the burning of the buildings and the closure of the nearby displaced persons' camp in the summer of 1950. The area reverted to heath; few traces of the camp remained. However, as early as May 1945, the British had erected large signs at the former camp site. Ex-prisoners began to set up monuments. A first wooden memorial was built by Jewish DPs in September 1945, followed by one made in stone, dedicated on the first anniversary of the liberation in 1946. On November 2, 1945, a large wooden cross was dedicated as a memorial to the murdered Polish prisoners. Also by the end of 1945 the Soviets had built a memorial at the entrance to the POW cemetery. A memorial to the Italian POWs followed in 1950, but was removed when the bodies were reinterred in a Hamburg cemetery.\n\nThe British military authorities ordered the construction of a permanent memorial in September 1945 after having been lambasted by the press for the desolate state of the camp. In the summer of 1946, a commission presented the design plan, which included the obelisk and memorial walls. The memorial was finally inaugurated in a large ceremony in November 1952, with the participation of Germany's president Theodor Heuss, who called on the Germans never to forget what had happened at Belsen.For a long time, however, remembering Bergen-Belsen was not a political priority. Periods of attention were followed by long phases of official neglect. For much of the 1950s, Belsen \"was increasingly forgotten as a place of remembrance\". Only after 1957 did large groups of young people visit the place where Anne Frank had died. After anti-Semitic graffiti was scrawled on the Cologne synagogue over Christmas 1959, German chancellor Konrad Adenauer followed a suggestion by Nahum Goldmann, president of the World Jewish Congress, and visited the site of a former concentration camp for the first time. In a speech at the Bergen-Belsen memorial, Adenauer assured the Jews still living in Germany that they would have the same respect and security as everyone else. Afterwards, the German public saw the Belsen memorial as primarily a Jewish place of remembrance. Nevertheless, the memorial was redesigned in 1960\u201361. In 1966, a document centre was opened which offered a permanent exhibition on the persecution of the Jews, with a focus on events in the nearby Netherlands \u2013 where Anne Frank and her family had been arrested in 1944. This was complemented by an overview of the history of the Bergen-Belsen camp. This was the first ever permanent exhibit anywhere in Germany on the topic of Nazi crimes. However, there was still no scientific personnel at the site, with only a caretaker as permanent staff. Memorial events were only organized by the survivors themselves.\nIn October 1979, the president of the European Parliament Simone Veil, herself a survivor of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, came to the memorial for a speech which focused on the Nazi persecution of Roma and Sinti. This was the first time that an official event in Germany acknowledged this aspect of the Nazi era.\n\nIn 1985, international attention was focused on Bergen-Belsen.  The camp was hastily included in Ronald Reagan's itinerary when he visited West Germany after a controversy about a visit to a cemetery where the interred included members of the Waffen SS (see Bitburg controversy). Shortly before Reagan's visit on May 5, there had been a large memorial event on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the camp's liberation, which had been attended by German president Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker and chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the aftermath of these events, the parliament of Lower Saxony decided to expand the exhibition centre and to hire permanent scientific staff. In 1990, the permanent exhibition was replaced by a new version and a larger document building was opened.\nOnly in 2000 did the Federal Government of Germany begin to financially support the memorial. Co-financed by the state of Lower Saxony, a complete redesign was planned which was intended to be more in line with contemporary thought on exhibition design. On April 15, 2005, there was a ceremony, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation and many ex-prisoners and ex-liberating troops attended. In October 2007, the redesigned memorial site was opened, including a large new Documentation Centre and permanent exhibition on the edge of the newly redefined camp, whose structure and layout can now be traced. Since 2009, the memorial has been receiving funding from the Federal government on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe site is open to the public and includes monuments to the dead, including a successor to the wooden cross of 1945, some individual memorial stones and a \"House of Silence\" for reflection. In addition to the Jewish, Polish and Dutch national memorials, a memorial to eight Turkish citizens who were killed at Belsen was dedicated in December 2012.\n\n\n== Personal accounts ==\n\nThe British comedian Michael Bentine, who took part in the liberation of the camp, wrote this on his encounter with Belsen:Millions of words have been written about these horror camps, many of them by inmates of those unbelievable places. I've tried, without success, to describe it from my own point of view, but the words won't come. To me Belsen was the ultimate blasphemy.\nMemories of Anne Frank, a book written by Alison Leslie Gold on the recollections of Hannah Goslar, a friend of Anne Frank\nMervin Willett Gonin DSO wrote about the immediate aftermath to the liberation of Bergen-Belsen in his diary.\nLeslie Hardman, British Army Jewish Chaplain and Rabbi, was the first Jewish Chaplain to enter the camp, two days after its liberation, and published his account in the collective book Belsen in History and Memory.\nIn Bergen-Belsen 1945: A Medical Student's Journal, volunteer Michael Hargrave gives his first-hand testimony of working at the displaced persons camp after liberation.\nAnita Lasker-Wallfisch describes life in Belsen, its liberation and her stay at the displaced persons camp in her autobiography Inherit the Truth.\nShaul Ladany, who was in the camp as an 8-year-old and later survived the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics recalled:I saw my father beaten by the SS, and I lost most of my family there...  A ransom deal that the Americans attempted saved 2,000 Jews and I was one. I actually went into the gas chamber, but was reprieved. God knows why.\nIn his book From Belsen to Buckingham Palace Paul Oppenheimer tells of the events leading up to the internment of his whole family at the camp and their incarceration there between February 1944 and April 1945, when he was aged 14\u201315. Following publication of the book, Oppenheimer personally talked to many groups and schools about the events he witnessed. This work is now continued by his brother Rudi, who shared the experiences.\nLeonard Webb, British veteran from the liberation of the camp.\nDescribing the concentration camp, Major Dick Williams, one of the first British soldiers to enter and liberate the camp, said: \"It was an evil, filthy place; a hell on Earth.\"\nAbel Herzberg wrote the diary Between Two Streams (Dutch: Tweestromenland) during his internment in Bergen-Belsen\nBritish servicemen Denis Norden and Eric Sykes, who later became popular comedians, stumbled upon the camp in 1945 shortly after liberation; \"Appalled, aghast, repelled \u2013 it is difficult to find words to express how we felt as we looked upon the degradation of some of the inmates not yet repatriated,\" Sykes later wrote. \"They squatted in their thin, striped uniforms, unmoving bony structures who could have been anywhere between 30 and 60 years old, staring ahead with dead, hopeless eyes and incapable of feeling any relief at their deliverance.\"\nA number of British artists depicted the aftermath of the liberation of the camp. These included Eric Taylor, Leslie Cole, Doris Zinkeisen, Mary Kessell and Edgar Ainsworth.\nIn his 2011 autobiography I Was a Boy in Belsen, Holocaust survivor Tomi Reichental recounts his experiences as a prisoner in the Bergen- Belsen concentration camp.\nIn The Dead Years - Holocaust Memoirs (ISBN 9789492371164), published by Amsterdam Publishers, survivor Joseph Schupack (1922-1989) tells about his last camp, Bergen-Belsen (pp. 173\u2013174):\nAnd The Month Was May: A Memoir (ISBN 9781440140846) by Lilian Berliner  The book traces the life of Lillian Berliner, from her childhood in Hungary, to the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Bergen Belsen, to her eventual liberation and resettlement in New York. After a day\u2019s journey, we arrived at Bergen-Belsen. This concentration camp was hopelessly overcrowded and we were not accepted. The right hand no longer knew what the left hand was doing, so we were sent to an adjoining Wehrmacht compound. As the soldiers of the Wehrmacht marched out, we moved in. The confusion was unbelievable; this time it was disorder with German perfection. We were moved into clean barracks, equipped for human beings with excellent bathrooms and clean beds stacked three on top of each other. After all we had experienced in the preceding year, this was sheer luxury. There was no mention of the usual camp rituals, no roll calls and no work, but also no food.\nLieutenant Colonel Mervin Willett Gonin DSO It was shortly after the British Red Cross arrived, though it may have no connection, that a very large quantity of lipstick arrived. This was not at all what we men wanted, we were screaming for hundreds and thousands of other things and I don't know who asked for lipstick. I wish so much that I could discover who did it, it was the action of genius, sheer unadulterated brilliance. I believe nothing did more for those internees than the lipstick. Women lay in bed with no sheets and no nightie but with scarlet red lips, you saw them wandering about with nothing but a blanket over their shoulders, but with scarlet red lips. I saw a woman dead on the post mortem table and clutched in her hand was a piece of lipstick. At last someone had done something to make them individuals again, they were someone, no longer merely the number tattooed on the arm. At last they could take an interest in their appearance. That lipstick started to give them back their humanity.\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Relief of Belsen (2007 film)\nFrontline: \"Memory of the Camps\" (May 7, 1985, Season 3, Episode 18), is a 56-minute television documentary that addresses Bergen-Belsen and other Nazi concentration camps\nMemorandum (1965 film)\nNight Will Fall is a 2014 documentary film that includes video footage shot by British armed forces upon their liberation of Bergen-Belsen\n\n\n== Known for ==\nThis camp is perhaps best known as the death place of Anne and Margot Frank, who both died of typhus there in February or March 1945, shortly before the camp was liberated on April 15, 1945.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBergen-Belsen Memorial\nThe United States' Holocaust Memorial website on Belsen\nNazi concentration camps on YouTube\nBergen-Belsen Death Camp from Holocaust Survivors and Remembrance Project: \"Forget You Not\"\nFilm footage of Belsen concentration camp and its destruction\nHarold Le Druillenec, from the Channel Islands, was the only British survivor of Bergen Belsen.

          "This place was discussed by a friend as somewhere to go whilst in the region.... On retrospect, I am very happy to have come here but part of me wishes I never have. Went through the memorial to see the exhibit that has been constructed as a memorial and it is like a",
          "An unexpected experience. The memorial museum is of the highest quality and the restrained architecture is the best foil for the displays and information. We did the camp walk first then the museum. Might be better doing museum first for impact. The book is also worth buying.",
          "Information centre has thought provoking displays. Some displays unsuitable for under 14 year olds (warning signs advising of this). Small cafe and rest rooms. The grounds have changed significantly since my last visit. The whole area appears to be being allowed to mature",
          "I notice that several other people have the same difficulty as me in saying outright that this is a good place to visit. However, it does not detract from the history of the place to say \"go see\". I felt the setting, design, look, and presentation of the place set the mood for",
          "Difficult to describe something like this as fantastic, but it was. The site is huge, and whilst there aren't any buildings really left as such there are lots of foundations and signs explaining the site. One thing I did like are the boards with the pictures on at the exact",
          "Other reviews stated that it was basically and open field without much to see. I could not disagree more. The museum was eye opening; including artifacts, interviews, original footage, etc. The grounds were heart breaking. The mass graves where, in one case, 5000 people were",
          "I can't begin to explain the feelings I was left with after a visit to this awful place. British soldiers posted to the former nearby barracks were ordered to run down here to understand why British soldiers were still in Germany more than 60 years after the end of the second",
          "We drove by car to Bergen-Belsen Memorial. After a week in a car on the german small roads I have to say, the need better and bigger signs. We did find it after a while. Outside there are not much left of the camp but still very instresting to good around. You can get a map at",
          "Even though not much of the original camp left, it is still very impressive and insightful to see. The museum is impressive as well.",
          "Give yourselves plenty of time to visit, wander amongst the trees, be horrified to pass yet another mass grave containing 1000s of souls, to ponder at the inhumanity and indignity suffered here and listen to the interviews of survivors, of locals and of the guards themselves in",
          "Not much of the original camp left. However still an important memorial and a must see for anyone interested in WW2, that visit this part of Germany.",
          "This is a camp that is not one of the usual visits when in the region. Many do not know that this is where Anne Frank spent her last days. With that, there is a very dark feeling about the location since it is surrounded by woods and really nothing remains. It does not have",
          "As much a memorial as a museum this was an emotional as well educational experience The camp itself was raised by the British to rid the area of typhus but the burial mounds, silent room, maps, and tree lined walks helps one to understand what Bergen Belsen looked like. The",
          "It's hard to imagine that at such a lovely place in the woods so much cruelty was performed by the Nazi's. But the signs are everywhere... there are several mass graves with just a simple sign: 1000 / 3000 / 5000 people are buried here... just incredible. After the war",
          "It is very hard to put what you see and feel into words once you visit the Bergen-Belsen Memorial. Set at the grounds of the original concentration camp, non of which survived as it got burned down by the British Forces after it was evacuated to prevent the spread of typhus. It",
          "It seems to be another memorial but it is a little different. You have a long way to walk and as it is in the pure nature - you really have time to think of what had happened here...quite touching your heart!",
          "Visited Belsen whilst staying in Bergen for the weekend. This is a must for any one who is in this area. Whilst there is a lot of doom and gloom in and around the Belsen grounds something good has developed from the history from the past. You have a good walk around the",
          "This is the camp where Anne Frank died in 1945. There is now a wonderful memorial center that goes through the long history of the Nazi persecution of the Jews plus what went on in the camp after the liberation. Although it is quite somber, it is an excellent place to visit",
          "I only knew of Bergen-Belsen as the concentration camp where Anne Frank died. I didn't realize it's role as not only a POW camp, but that it was used the way it was at the end of the war, as the Allied Forces were pushing north....I didn't know that so many prisoners were",
          "I visited often to remind myself why I chose to risk all for pennies in the British army rather than follow a more rewarding career. Each visit was different. It was snowing. It was fine. It was raining. It was deserted. It was bubbling with young students with paper work in",
          "Its the 3rd time I\u2019ve visited in the last 30 years 1985 / 93 . The visitors centre has improved massively , with a nice cafe and a lot more exhibits available to see and hear . The history of the camp and recollections of people that were incarcerated by the nazis . With it",
          "We had previously visited Dachau in the 80's during a 4 day visit to Munich and when we saw an excursion from the cruise ship Black Watch to visit Bergen Belsen memorial, we decided to go. The ship was docked in Hamburg and the coach took circa 2 hours to get there, which left",
          "Allthough little but burial mounds, foundations and personal monuments remain, this place chills you. The memorial has intriguing relics, photos and documents and gives a good perspective on what exactly happened, and when. It also focuses on Belsen's role as a tank trainimg",
          "This place was a bucket list kind of place that i wanted to visit.. my older daughter also wanted to visit having just done world war 2 in history gcse.... Very moving to visit... There is a exhibition that goes into alot of detail of how the camp came about before, during and",
          "I think everyone should visit these places, it really is a very moving experience and hard to understand that people can do what went on there, it's free to visit.",
          "How to start this? I don't know, Bergen Belsen Memorial is a place everyone should visit once in their life, if they did, the world would be a different, more peaceful place. The setup of the museum is eminent, the camp site, beautiful and horrible at the same time. I shed a",
          "Right wing political parties are rising in popularity, conspiracy theories including Holocaust denial are fashionable online. We need to protect and remember these sights of inhumanity to help prevent a repeat. The memorial museum is superbly presented. Lots of people",
          "Very thought provoking in an age where we seem to have learnt nothing from our past experiences. A well balanced and meaningful memorial that provides some harrowing but fascinating detail.",
          "Well can you say ..... I came to Bergen-Belsen as a soldier in the British Army as I was stationed up the road in haig barracks hohne. At looking at the place now you would never of guessed what happened at this dreadful camp. There is a museum on site free of charge you can",
          "Last year I visited Sachsenhausen outside Berlin. This was a concentration camp and many of its buildings remain. Bergen-Belsen was primarily a POW camp but later became a camp for others, including Jews held as bargaining chips. There are no buildings left but, far more",
          "Other concentration camps have more to see, but that is not the point. The mounds of earth marked 5000 buried here or 2000 buried here bring a lump to your throat and makes you stare in disbelief in Man's inhumanity to Man. The area is silent, birds tend to fly around the",
          "We went to the Bergen-Belsen memorial as my wives father was in one of the first regiments to liberate the camp. The exhibition is superb but very harrowing and not for young children. The area, although demolished can be relived with a IPAD that gives you and indication of",
          "If you aren't sure whether you want to visit this place then you must say yes! It's extremely important to understand what happened here. The weather was lovely and hot when we visited which was perfect to ensure we walked everywhere. Just take it all in & learn as much as you",
          "As with other concentration camps visited the exhibition here is similar in that it gives a very moving factual account of the camp from its start to after liberation. With pictures, videos and numerous artifacts a visit needs about 2hiurs. Whilst nothing is left of the camp",
          "The site of the Bergen-Belsen camp, a cold winter morning. As much as visiting the sites of so much human suffering is incredibly painful, I think it is incredibly important that we do and remember what happened so we can make sure it doesn't happen again",
          "Well maintained place. Was a huge area and a grim reminder of the mistakes by humanity in the past. A must see for all tourists who are in the area for a \"reality shock\" of what happened in WW2. Be prepared to spend some time here as there is a lot to read and see.",
          "A very moving but interesting place to visit.The films in the information centre are very moving as they are told by the survivors.You could spend all day just watching them.",
          "As a site of extreme pain and suffering, Bergen-Belsen is extremely beautiful and one of the best historical sites I have ever visited. The memorial is free and excepts donations. The site itself has many reflective contemporary monuments. The site is never very busy so there it",
          "An interesting place to visit. A place to see. A memorial for the thousands who lost their lives here. A special memorial for Anne Franck and her sister who died here.",
          "I'll keep this short.....this is definitely worth a visit. Just to give you a reality check of the atrocities than man has done. The exhibition is fantastic and well informed. The staff were very knowledgeable. Nature has now began to take over and is a lovely view",
          "This has got to be one of the most chilling places to visit. The tragic history and the silents of the place well mark the events that occurred. The amount of people who died after alien forces arrived but were to ill to save is horrifying. Recommend visiting but a place you",
          "This is a serene and quiet spot that makes you reflect on the horrors of the past and present. There is a museum showing what the concentration camp was about. Outside there are memorials to groups and individuals who died in the camp, the most famous is Anne Frank who died here",
          "On a cold, snowy winters day in 1968, I drove up to a small wooden shack with pictures; walked through the eerie woods until I came to the multiple burial grounds.....things have changed. The giant parking lot, ample free parking, accommodates the many visitors. The small",
          "This is a park and graveyard to comemmorate all the victims in 1000's that died under awfull conditions under Nazi-role and government. Sillent and reverently, but also a Picture of these awfull misdeeds during 2nd Word War by the Nazies.",
          "Many people have heard about Auschwitz concentration camp but very few people have heard abut Bergen-Belsen POW/Concentration Camp. We only heard about this place when we were visiting Germany. There is a museum before you enter the memorial site, which provides pictures,",
          "You really need to allow at least a full half day to visit this memorial site, the stark nature of the information centre building suits the vast amount of information available to the visitor and the manner in which it is presented . The main site long since destroyed has been",
          "This memorial was incredibly educational and had a good mix of pictures, visual supplements, and actual artifacts to aid in better understanding the devastating loss of so many lives in Bergen-Belsen. The outdoor memorial was quite peaceful and sobering as well. For someone",
          "I visited it with university tour in Nov 2014. It was my first visit to concentration and it was very stunning. The tour guide did a great job to lead us time travel back to the Nazi times. Led us imagine how life was in that time, being tortured day after day..... There are",
          "This camp was raised to the ground soon after the end of the war so now it doesn't look like a concentration camp but its been very well organised. Well worth a visit as it has a very interesting museum which is full of things from the time and lots of testimonies from people",
          "Concentration and POW camps were totally destroyed and the area is a park now, so don't expect anything similar to Auschwitz or Stutthof camps. The most interesting part is the museum building, made of glass and concrete. Really good piece of modern architecture.",
          "We first came here in the early 1980's and took my grandmother, who was of the same generation as many of the victims and was visibly moved. We came back over 30 years later to find it has had buildings added to it, newsreels, testimonies of victims, photos, stories etc. Glad my",
          "The allies burned the appalling camp to the ground not long after liberation due to the spread of disease at the place. To that end, there is not much to see here- but it is eerie, moving and essential to come here if you are in the area. Just to pay one's respects for what went",
          "A very informative and eerie place. Everybody should visit here and be educated about the holocaust. Could sense the sadness of the place.",
          "The memorial at Bergen-Belsen provides a thought provoking insight to the horrors of the Nazi persecution of the Jews in the 2nd world war. The exhibition sets out the atrocities chronologically and in a factual manner that uses the powerful personal testimony of survivors and",
          "This is a must for any visitors in the area, to see the vastness of what was here is amazing. I would highly recommend that everyone watches the video available in the museum all the way through, to watch the plight of those that were kept here is very emotional.",
          "I attended the 70th Anniversary of the Liberation of Bergen-Belsen in 1945. They do regular tours for the local German schoolchildren to hopefully teach them what can happen when a dictator takes charge and I am sure in the hope that such atrocities will never be denied or",
          "I went some time ago, and it really was an experience. I can't really put into words the feeling you walking around. Shocking. But I'm glad I went, you hear all the history in school but to be there is something else. Obviously not for young children, but for those a little",
          "Very interesting historically. It used to be a concentration camp during WW2. Very sad and I cried when I was there. A place to see. Especially if you are Jewish.",
          "The new museum complex is a far cry from my last visit during the early sixties when I was stationed in the British Army at Hohne. The artifacts in the museum have been laid out in a way tells the story of the people who died and also those who were liberated during and at the",
          "Nice (not sure if this word is apt for this place) opportunity to learn something about WW2 and its atrocities. The lay out of the huge complex is well thought out and modern. A must visit for every history lover.",
          "A vivid reminder to all of the horrors that befell those caught up in the mass extermination in World War 2. An excellent information gives all the background on how the camp was formed and how its use changed as the war rolled on. A place I will never forget",
          "This is part cemetery, part history lesson, and part natural park. What one sees upon entry to a large open field is very little that reminds one of the place's history, but as you wander around you find memorials small and large dedicated to the thousands of people who",
          "We visited this memorial today. I think everyone should visit it and pay respects to that terrible era. The memorial itself is beautifully and tastefully laid out. And a lot of thought has gone into the design. On the Internet there are rules to abide by regarding conduct and",
          "The Documentation Centre is a harsh, concrete unforgiving building which stands at the entrance to this vast green site that blankets the horrors that occurred here. Although there are no original buildings standing there are some visible reminders of what was on this site.",
          "The memorial site is enormous and we only had an hours time there. I think at least 2+ hours are needed to see it all properly. The museum was very well put together and was packed with information, stories and artifacts of the camp. For the museum alone a few hours are",
          "This kind of places is for reflection from the not so far away past to the future.. Is the most noisy silence that we will ever heard. So empty and also so crouded of souls.",
          "**Please note it is a memorial, none of the original buildings or real estate remains, it was all burnt down after the war to prevent spread of disease. That said it was a fitting and thoughtful memorial to the horrors that happened there - touching stories captured on video,",
          "The museum at the site of the former Bergen-Belsen concentration camp is very well done. We could have spent more time there taking in all the exhibits, videos of testimonials, and pictures. The tour was well worth it, and Daniel did an outstanding job of explaining the",
          "my friend who now lives in England to me with her to visit her mother and I realised it wasn't too far from where she lives so we planned a visit. it is very hard to imagine the horrors of what went on in this place as it is so very beautiful and peaceful. we didn't get round it",
          "We visited the memorial last week. It was very moving to walk around the site but difficult to visualize the horror. The museum was well laid out and overwhelming to see and read the memorabilia.",
          "Having lived in the area I've been here a few times. Over the last years it has had serious improvements. It is, however, NOT a \"few hours\" thing. You need to plan a full day, and visit the cattle wagon a few kilometers away to really appreciate everything. The best part is",
          "We visited here as we have an interest in history and archaeology and this site was very harrowing and put into perspective what evil can do. The visitor center is well planned and very informative. I struggle what i can write here to review this site properly as this site",
          "If you want to go some where thought provoking then this is the place for you. It shows mans inhumanity towards man. Just for being different. The moment you walk into the camp the silence hits you no birds no nothing. The graves take you breath away. Just knowing 10.000 buried",
          "A vast bleak site that is very poignant and thought provoking. No remains of the camp remain but there is an excellent map and guide which educates you as you walk round. Poignant photographs at regular points that are haunting. Travelled with a young teenager who came away",
          "It is a huge area and you need to be fit to take it all in. Lots of pictorial and videa content, a small coffee shop, the Russian Cemetery was just too much to take in.I had always thought that it was about the Jews but 20 thousand Russian troops perished there among many",
          "Visited the Belsen memorial it was so interesting and mind blowing how quite everything was not even a bird chirping not anything",
          "I went to Bergen-Belsen with my two daughters because my mother was liberated from here and I just felt that I wanted to go. I have a picture of my mother in a British Army Truck outside Building number 57 which was published in an article recently which specified my mother's",
          "Set amongst forestry it sits silent. I have visited several times and find the memorial to be calm and respectful. The lack of physical building means it does not suffer the 'overcrowding' that other memorials sometimes do. Be sure to walk down to the Russian Graveyard (staying",
          "Make no mistake that if you choose to visit Bergen-Belsen it may prove to be somewhat overwhelming. The holocaust is not a tourist attraction and the memorial shows what man's inhuman side is capable of. Having served in Germany for almost 14 years in the armed forces I have",
          "This museum and memorial is just outstanding. Everything here is done with such humility and respect that I cannot fault it. When there it felt very peaceful. I do not have a bad word to say about this memorial and museum......this is a must see if you find yourself in this",
          "The Bergen-Belsen memorial has been thoughtfully created. It's very accessible for those in wheelchairs and buggies, as you can get around the site on wide, paved paths. It's worth being aware that most of what there is to see is outside in an unsheltered area, so come prepared",
          "There are no remaining buildings. The site is part the open plain with a memorial and some marking on where the buildings stood, but it does not take away the strong and deep feel you get when you enter the area. The museum part takes you through the years of the Bergen-Belsen",
          "Almost nothing remains from the camp (british troops destroyed it because of the typhus epidemic) but you're still moved with all information and the life of the camp. A bit apart you have also access to the soviet soldiers graveyard and \"camp\" (nothing remains). They all",
          "We were in Bergen visiting family during the Xmas/NewYear holiday and took the opportunity to take a walk around the grounds of the concentration camp. It was very quiet and we were among only a handful of visitors there as the weather was cold raining and windy. But",
          "If you are curious or unaware of any type of conditions for prisoners of war during ww2 you need to visit this outstanding and saddening memorial. This is not a place for the over emotional or easily sickened. It's is graphic and eerie, but I will never regret going! It was the",
          "I have visited this a couple of times. My father was at the liberation of Belsen in 1945. The museum is very modern and excellent. The video stories from survivors are very interesting as are the exhibits. As you walk from the museum towards the former camp site, you are",
          "Well worth a visit. Very moving and informative. The children felt and commented on the stillness and the feeling of reverence. A very moving experience.",
          "Very moving trip a visit is essential if you are in the area as it will really brings home the atrocities of this era. Although pretty much all of the original camp has gone there is still plenty to read and many items still remain from the camp. The mass graves really put it",
          "A visit to the Bergen Belsen site is a must if you are in the area. The various memorials and mass graves are quite moving to see and when you envisage what went on here in the various areas it is mind blowing. We should never allow the world to forget this at all. The whole",
          "Never let this happen again, these places need to be visited by everyone to see that the Holocaust did happen.",
          "The new buildings since our last visit contains alot more information. More detail on offer that explains in graphic detail what took place here.",
          "We arrived at close to 6:00PM and the exhibition halls were closing so we didn't get to go in but we were able to walk around the Monument area which was more than fine with us as we have traveled to many camps before. The area was destroyed due to Typhus epidemic but there",
          "This is a must see if you are in Germany. When we arrived we were able to get a private tour as there were not too many people about. The Exhibition/Museum of the former POW/Concentration camp is mind blowing. Our daughters were moved and in deep reflection following the tour",
          "Very moving and certainly a must do. The experience was slightly marred by the disrespectful behaviour of a group of German schoolchildren who were noisy ( including messing around in the film room) and running around ( they were at least 15/16 so should have known better).",
          "I last visited this site 30+ yrs ago but now they have really opened up the site, I was there for about 4hrs. Many more building with information regarding the Holocaust but also information about POW's which I had not been aware of, these were the start of this terrible camp.",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect from this memorial especially as most of the camp was burnt down to quell the Typhus epidemic. In many ways it makes the experience more poignont. The mass graves are just unfathomable. As you walk around you see them marked 'here lie 5000, 2000,",
          "Really moving experience. Walk thru area is impressive - despite lack of old buildings. The showroom is so full of information, that we had to give up. But gives good and memoryfull history lesson, Really worth visiting.",
          "The grounds are huge... ...is very well kept and serene... ...located behind the exhibition area are the mass graves (or cemetry) and the war memorial. The concentration camp itself is no more except for the camp gates. There is a very interesting and informative visitor centre",
          "This place is both moving and harrowing. Although non of the building are there the silence is enough to make you think. The grounds are amazingly large and take at least 1 1/2 hours to walk round. The museum is extremely good, you do need to take the time to listen to the",
          "2nd visit and nice to see the improvements that have been made. Well worth a trip. Easy to find with plenty of parking. The museum is also free to enter. Memorial consists of areas to walk around and see the mass graves and an indoor centre showing films and displaying",
          "A sombering visit to the site of one of the Nazi concentration camp is not, on the face of it, a place to go. However it is, not least because this is the last resting place of the diarist Anne Frank. Full marks should go to the Germans for keeping this site as a monument to all",
          "A visit to the Bergen-Belsen Memorial is bound to be a profound and moving experience for any adult. Definitely a must-see.",
          "As a family we went to see germany for the first time. We were situated 30 minutes away from Bergen Belsen, A real eye opener to experience being in a place were such appalling events went on, It touched us all the reality of what man can do to man, And we will never forget",
          "I've been visiting Germany now for about 40 years, during my first visit in the early 70's I visited the site of the original Bergen \"Belsen Concentration Camp\". Back in those days the mass graves were about the only features there. As you drove in to a clearing in the woodland,",
          "I have been several times now. In one sense it is a very beautiful spot - set amongst beech trees close to Luneberg Heath, it is a very peaceful spot. There are no watchtowers now, or iron gates, and it comes as a bit of a shock to come across a large mound stating that \"Here",

          "We visited this memorial as part of a tour of Germany it is located not far from major routes and is easily accessible. There is no entry fee. This is shocking to see and the videos that you can watch even more so. Not something that we as humans should Be proud of Although this",
          "Bergen-Belsen is a few minutes by car from Bergen in Niedersachsen, not too far from Celle. The camp was a concentration camp (as opposed to being an extermination camp - these were not built on German soil.) The site is huge so be prepared to walk to see everything, we were",
          "The memorial is well worth a vist,its all set out in a very respectful and intresting way.There is also a caf\u00e9 which doesn't cash in on being there,the book shop is worth a look around aswell.",

It was designed by the Swiss architecten Claude Paillard and seats 630 people. Its large stage (Gro\u00dfe B\u00fchne) is traditionelly the location of the opening of a new season. Two smaller stages are located in adjacent historic buildings, the Cumberlandsche Galerie, a listed monument with a large staircase, used for events for up to 85 spectators, and the Cumberlandsche B\u00fchne, a former rehearsal stage, for up to 198 seats. The complex also houses a Theatermuseum (Theatre museum) that presents temporary exhibitions and documentation of the history of the theatre.\nBallhof Eins and Ballhof Zwei, which were for a long time the main stages for plays in the city, have been used for youth theatre and youth opera since 2000 after the new Schauspielhaus was completed.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nJohann Frerking: Augenblicke des Theaters: aus 4 Jahrzehnten hannoverscher B\u00fchnengeschichte.

        "wiki": "Hildesheim [\u02c8h\u026ald\u0259s\u02ccha\u026a\u032fm] (listen) is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany with 104,230 inhabitants. It is in the district of Hildesheim, about 30 km (19 mi) southeast of Hanover on the banks of the Innerste River, a small tributary of the Leine River.\nThe Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious founded the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815 and created the first settlement with a chapel on the so called Domh\u00fcgel.\nHildesheim is situated on autobahn route 7, and hence is at the connection point of the North (Hamburg and beyond) with the South of Europe.\nWith the Hildesheim Cathedral and the St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985.\nIn 2015 the city and the diocese celebrated their 1200th anniversary.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nHildesheim, one of the oldest cities in Northern Germany, became the seat of the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815 and may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the ford across the River Innerste, which was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement around the cathedral very quickly developed into a town and was granteded market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held in a street called Alter Markt (Old Market) which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around the church St. Andreas. When the city grew further, a larger market place became necessary. The present market place of Hildesheim was laid out at the beginning of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nWhen Hildesheim obtained city status in 1249, it was one of the biggest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a town Hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present Town Hall started in 1268. In 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519\u201323 when they engaged in a feud.\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\nHildesheim became Lutheran in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1813, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia as a province after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. In 1868 a highly valuable trove of about 70 Roman silver vessels for eating and drinking, the so-called Hildesheim Treasure, was unearthed by Prussian soldiers.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century and World War II ===\nThe city was heavily damaged by air raids in 1945, especially on 22 March. Although it had little military significance, two months before the end of the war in Europe the historic city was bombed as part of the Area Bombing Directive in order to undermine the morale of the German people. 28.5% of the houses were completely destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses remained undamaged. The centre, which had retained its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. The city as a whole was destroyed by 20 - 30%. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall.\n\n\n=== Late 20th century and present ===\nIn 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic centre began. Some of the unattractive concrete buildings around the market place were torn down and replaced by replicas of the original buildings. In the autumn of 2007, a decision was made to reconstruct the Umgest\u00fclpter Zuckerhut (Upended Sugarloaf), an iconic half-timbered house famous for its unusual shape. In 2015 the city and the diocese celebrates their 1200 anniversary with the Day of Lower Saxony.\n\n\n== Religions ==\nIn 1542 most of the inhabitants became Lutherans. Today, 28.5% of the inhabitants identify themselves as Roman Catholics (Hildesheim Diocese) and 38.3% as Protestants (Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover). 33.0% of the inhabitants are adherents of other religions or do not have a religion at all. The Serbian Orthodox Bishop of Frankfurt and all of Germany has his seat in Himmelsth\u00fcr (a locality of Hildesheim).\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe Marktplatz (historic market place) was reconstructed in 1984\u20131990 after its destruction in the March 1945 air raid. The more noteworthy buildings in the square are:\nThe Knochenhaueramtshaus (Butchers' Guild Hall), originally built in 1529 and destroyed in 1945, it was reconstructed from 1987 to 1989 according to original plans. The fa\u00e7ade is sumptuously decorated with colourful paintings and German proverbs. Today the building houses a restaurant and the City Museum.\nThe B\u00e4ckeramtshaus (Bakers' Guild Hall) is a half-timbered house which was originally built in 1825. It was destroyed in 1945 and rebuilt 1987-89. Today, it houses a caf\u00e9.\nThe Town Hall, erected in the 13th century in Gothic style. Partly destroyed in 1945, it was rebuilt and inaugurated in 1954.\nThe Tempelhaus, a late-Gothic 14th-century patrician house, which today houses the tourist information office. It suffered some damage during the Second World War but was restored and inaugurated in 1950.\nThe Wedekindhaus, a 16th-century patrician house, is characterised by its high, ornately carved storeys including their ledges with depictions of allegorical figures.\nThe adjoining L\u00fcntzelhaus was built in 1755 in Baroque style.\nThe Rolandhaus was originally built in the 14th century in Gothic style. In 1730, the house was remodelled, and a Baroque portal and a large bay window were added.\nThe Stadtsch\u00e4nke (Town Tavern) is a large half-timbered house which was originally built in 1666. The smaller adjoining Rococcohaus was built in 1730 in rococo style.\nThe Wollenwebergildehaus (Weavers' Guild Hall) was approximately built in 1600.\nThe Romanesque St. Mary's Cathedral (Hildesheim Cathedral), with its ancient bronze doors (Bernward Doors) (c. 1015) and other treasures. The cathedral was built in the 9th century, but almost completely destroyed in 1945; it was reconstructed soon after the war. It has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. The \"Thousand-year Rose\" is a reputedly 1,000\u2011year\u2011old dog rose bush, allegedly the world's oldest living rose. It continues to flourish on the wall of the cathedral apse.\nMuseum of the Cathedral: Cathedral Treasure.\nSt. Michael's Church (UNESCO World Heritage Site) \u2013 an early Romanesque church in Germany and an example of Ottonian architecture. It was built from 1010 to 1022.\nThe St. Andreas (St. Andrew's Church), a 12th-century Gothic church with the highest church steeple (114.5 m) in Lower Saxony.

          "The museum is really modern and well laid out with lots of interesting content about the history of the town and the Pied Piper. There's a bit in English but understandably the exhibits are only described in German. The James Bond exhibit was fantastic and the Pied Piper show",
          "The inside of the museum is much bigger than the outside appears! The story starts thousands of years ago and comes all the way to the present day. The mechanical depiction of the pied Piper story was very good. 5 euro entrance fee is very fair. Had I not been a German speaker",
          "Wasn't sure quite what to make of the place after we'd visited as it seems to be a number of different museums in one. The history of Hameln certainly made sense; it was a little strange to then have part of a floor dedicated to the 1970s, and a collection of holocaust and nazi",

        "wiki": "Hildesheim [\u02c8h\u026ald\u0259s\u02ccha\u026a\u032fm] (listen) is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany with 104,230 inhabitants. It is in the district of Hildesheim, about 30 km (19 mi) southeast of Hanover on the banks of the Innerste River, a small tributary of the Leine River.\nThe Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious founded the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815 and created the first settlement with a chapel on the so called Domh\u00fcgel.\nHildesheim is situated on autobahn route 7, and hence is at the connection point of the North (Hamburg and beyond) with the South of Europe.\nWith the Hildesheim Cathedral and the St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985.\nIn 2015 the city and the diocese celebrated their 1200th anniversary.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nHildesheim, one of the oldest cities in Northern Germany, became the seat of the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815 and may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the ford across the River Innerste, which was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement around the cathedral very quickly developed into a town and was granteded market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held in a street called Alter Markt (Old Market) which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around the church St. Andreas. When the city grew further, a larger market place became necessary. The present market place of Hildesheim was laid out at the beginning of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nWhen Hildesheim obtained city status in 1249, it was one of the biggest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a town Hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present Town Hall started in 1268. In 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519\u201323 when they engaged in a feud.\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\nHildesheim became Lutheran in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1813, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia as a province after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. In 1868 a highly valuable trove of about 70 Roman silver vessels for eating and drinking, the so-called Hildesheim Treasure, was unearthed by Prussian soldiers.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century and World War II ===\nThe city was heavily damaged by air raids in 1945, especially on 22 March. Although it had little military significance, two months before the end of the war in Europe the historic city was bombed as part of the Area Bombing Directive in order to undermine the morale of the German people. 28.5% of the houses were completely destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses remained undamaged. The centre, which had retained its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. The city as a whole was destroyed by 20 - 30%. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall.\n\n\n=== Late 20th century and present ===\nIn 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic centre began. Some of the unattractive concrete buildings around the market place were torn down and replaced by replicas of the original buildings. In the autumn of 2007, a decision was made to reconstruct the Umgest\u00fclpter Zuckerhut (Upended Sugarloaf), an iconic half-timbered house famous for its unusual shape. In 2015 the city and the diocese celebrates their 1200 anniversary with the Day of Lower Saxony.\n\n\n== Religions ==\nIn 1542 most of the inhabitants became Lutherans. Today, 28.5% of the inhabitants identify themselves as Roman Catholics (Hildesheim Diocese) and 38.3% as Protestants (Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover). 33.0% of the inhabitants are adherents of other religions or do not have a religion at all. The Serbian Orthodox Bishop of Frankfurt and all of Germany has his seat in Himmelsth\u00fcr (a locality of Hildesheim).\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe Marktplatz (historic market place) was reconstructed in 1984\u20131990 after its destruction in the March 1945 air raid. The more noteworthy buildings in the square are:\nThe Knochenhaueramtshaus (Butchers' Guild Hall), originally built in 1529 and destroyed in 1945, it was reconstructed from 1987 to 1989 according to original plans.

Today the building houses a restaurant and the City Museum.\nThe B\u00e4ckeramtshaus (Bakers' Guild Hall) is a half-timbered house which was originally built in 1825. It was destroyed in 1945 and rebuilt 1987-89. Today, it houses a caf\u00e9.\nThe Town Hall, erected in the 13th century in Gothic style. Partly destroyed in 1945, it was rebuilt and inaugurated in 1954.\nThe Tempelhaus, a late-Gothic 14th-century patrician house, which today houses the tourist information office. It suffered some damage during the Second World War but was restored and inaugurated in 1950.\nThe Wedekindhaus, a 16th-century patrician house, is characterised by its high, ornately carved storeys including their ledges with depictions of allegorical figures.\nThe adjoining L\u00fcntzelhaus was built in 1755 in Baroque style.\nThe Rolandhaus was originally built in the 14th century in Gothic style.

The cathedral was built in the 9th century, but almost completely destroyed in 1945; it was reconstructed soon after the war. It has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. The \"Thousand-year Rose\" is a reputedly 1,000\u2011year\u2011old dog rose bush, allegedly the world's oldest living rose. It continues to flourish on the wall of the cathedral apse.\nMuseum of the Cathedral: Cathedral Treasure.\nSt. Michael's Church (UNESCO World Heritage Site) \u2013 an early Romanesque church in Germany and an example of Ottonian architecture. It was built from 1010 to 1022.\nThe St. Andreas (St. Andrew's Church), a 12th-century Gothic church with the highest church steeple (114.5 m) in Lower Saxony. Opposite the church stand the Upended Sugarloaf, a half-timbered house dating from 1509.\nThe Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum, with collections from ancient Egypt and Peru and special exhibitions.\nThe Kreuzkirche (Church of the Holy Cross) was originally a part of the medieval fortifications. It was converted into a church around 1079, severely damaged in 1945 and rebuilt after the war.\nThe Romanesque Basilica Minor of St. Godehard (St. Gotthard's Church), built 1133\u20131172, which is scheduled to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the near future. Other notable buildings stand opposite the church: St. Nicolai's Chapel is a former parish church which was built in the Romanesque style in the 12th century and transformed into a residential building after 1803, and the Hospital of the Five Wounds which is a large half-timbered house dating from 1770 with a half-hip roof.\nThe church St. Lamberti is a late Gothic building, venue of a weekly concert series at market time.\nThe Kehrwiederturm (Kehrwieder Tower), built around 1300, is the only remaining tower of the medieval fortifications.\nHalf-timbered houses which were not destroyed during World War II can be seen around St. Godehard and the Kehrwieder Tower, in the streets Ke\u00dflerstra\u00dfe, Knollenstra\u00dfe, Gelber Stern, Am Kehrwieder, Lappenberg, Br\u00fchl, Hinterer Br\u00fchl, and Godehardsplatz. Some of them have ornate wood carvings in their fa\u00e7ades, e.g. the Wernersches Haus (1606) in Godehardsplatz and the Waffenschmiedehaus (weapon smith house, 1548) at Gelber Stern.\nThe church St. Jacobi (St. James' Church) is a 500-year-old pilgrim church in the Gothic style and was one of the many St. James chapels on St. James's Path. Today the church is a culture church with emphasis on literature.\nThe Monument of the Synagogue (consecrated in 1849 and destroyed in 1938 during the Kristallnacht) was erected in 1988 in the old Jewish quarter on Lappenberg Street. The foundations were reconstructed to give observers an idea of how large the synagogue was. The reddish brick building (built around 1840) opposite was the Jewish school.\nMauritiuskirche (St. Maurice's Church), a Romanesque church (11th century) on a hill in the west of the city in the quarter of Moritzberg with a cloister. The interior of the church is Baroque and the tower was added in 1765.\nKaiserhaus (Emperor's House): Renaissance building (1586) in Alter Markt, the oldest street of Hildesheim, rebuilt after the war. The fa\u00e7ade is decorated with Roman statues and medallions. Opposite, there is a noteworthy sandstone bay window dating from 1568. Originally, it belonged to a private house which was torn down at the end of the 19th century. The bay window was dismantled before and added to another house in the eastern part of Hildesheim which remained undamaged during World War II. From there, the bay window was removed when the house was remodelled and added to the school at the present site in 1972.\nClose to the Kaiserhaus (Emperor's house) the Alte Kemenate, a noteworthy medieval store house reaching a height of 5.5 meters, can be seen behind the school in the street Alter Markt. It has a rectangular basis measuring 6.5 meters \u00d7 5.0 meters and a cellar with a vaulted construction. The store house, one of the oldest profane buildings in Hildesheim, was built of sandstone in a Gothic style the 15th century. According to other sources it might be even older, i.e. built between the end of the 11th and the middle of the 13th century. The building has two floors. As it did not consist of wood it did not burn down in 1945, but was only damaged and immediately repaired after the war. From 1945 - 1951 it was used for residential purposes. The Alte Kemenate is not open to the public.\nSt. Magdalena's Church (Magdalenenkirche) is a small church with large lancet windows in the historic street Old Market (Alter Markt) which was consecrated in 1224. It was originally built in a Romanesque style, but enlarged and remodelled in Gothic style in 1456. It houses a wooden altar (about 1520) with carvings and other works of art.

        "wiki": "The Maschsee is an artificial lake situated south of the city centre of Hanover in Germany. Spanning an area of 78 hectares, it is the largest body of water within the capital of Lower Saxony. The lake is a popular recreation area as well as a venue for numerous water sports.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the lake stems from the so-called \u201cLeinemarsch\u201c, or simply \u201dMarsch\u201c, meaning swamp. This is the historical description for the area in which the lake was built, that was in a deep-lying floodplain of the River Leine.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\n\n=== Design ===\nIt was first considered to create a lake in the wide river valley of the River Leine near Hanover during the late 19th century. This tied in with the by-then necessary dyking of the River Leine and the River Ihme, which would regularly flood the city after snow melted in the Harz Mountains in spring. The creation of a lake could reduce the threat of high water levels and put the Leine's river valley area to better use.\nIn the course of the decades there were further, very different designs: Small solutions and larger ones, which envisaged the Sch\u00fctzenplatz (shooting range) as an island in the lake. In September 1925 the newly elected city mayor Arthur Menge commissioned Otto Franzius, a water engineer and professor at the Hanover Technical College (now Leibniz University Hannover), to work out the details of the construction of a lake together with the city's building authorities. Franzius was to be responsible for the designing of the hydro-engineering and hydrological elements of the project, while the city authorities, led by Karl Elkart, would handle the urban development aspects.\nIn contrast to the original idea that the lake be dug down into swamp land and then be supplied with water by the Leine, a new proposal emerged to build the Maschsee atop the swamp in a bowl-like structure \u2013 raising it higher than the water level of the Leine \u2013 and having it be filled using a system of water pumps. This would eradicate the problem of a potential accumulation of mud through flood waters.\nFranzius created a final design that proved both effective and financially acceptable, whereupon the city authorities provided a grant of 14,000 Reichsmarks in January 1926 toward attempts to seal the basin of the proposed lake.\nDespite the plans being completed it nevertheless took roughly eight years until the beginning of the 1930s for work to commence. The three main factors behind the creation of an artificial lake in the River Leine\u2019s river valley were:\n\nThe embankment of the River Ihme\u2019s flood channel\nThe creation of a local recreation area close to the city that provided the opportunity for water sports\nThe elimination of high unemployment levels (1932: 58,000 Hanoverians) through programmes of public works.One factor against construction of the lake was the nearly 20-metre-high (66 ft) Bismarck Tower which stood in the centre of the proposed water feature. Here, paramilitary marches took place and it was the site of a book burning in 1933. The landmark was eventually demolished in 1935 during the course of the lake's construction.\n\n\n=== Job creation ===\nIn the 1930s, the era of the Great Depression, the city of Hanover lacked the necessary finance for the commencement of the Maschsee project, even though the project had already been planned some ten years earlier. The project was favourable for the Nazi Party that came to power in January 1933 as it would help reduce unemployment levels, which was a central theme of their propaganda. On 28 November 1933 the project was approved at a meeting of the city council.\nOn 21 March 1934 the first ground was broken in the Leine swamp. Despite the unsettled financing of the project, it provided many people with work. Driven by the harshness of the economic situation of the time, they took on tough working conditions and low pay which was barely much higher than unemployment support.\nDuring construction fourteen locomotive trains with 365 tipping wagons were used along a 15 km track as well as diggers and five crawler tractors. Many workers though had to supply their own tools. Initially there were 100 people working on the project, but by its completion 1,650 people had been involved to excavate roughly 780,000 square metres of earth to create the lake basin.\nWith the Maschsee project fully completed by early 1936, the official opening took place on 21 May 1936. Hundreds of thousands of Hanoverians and guests looked on from the edge of the lake as the event began with the then-typical trooping of the Nazi Party. In addition some 6,000 sporting persons took part in a rally along with the armed forces and public officials.\nDuring World War II the lake was covered up with canvasses and fake landscapes created on floating islands created, in an attempt to confuse Allied bomber pilots of their whereabouts during air raids on Hanover.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water level loses a maximum of 1.3 centimetres per day through evaporation and water seepage, which equates to 10,000 cubic metres of water. In order to maintain a constant level, a pump station at a series of ponds in Ricklingen provides the Maschsee with a water supply. Its three pumps send water along an 800-metre-long (2,600 ft) pipe to the \"source\" of the Maschsee. Depending on weather conditions, between 1-2 million m3 of water are required. From November until February no pumping is carried out, so the water level sinks on average 45 cm during this time.\n\nUntil 1960 the Maschsee's water level was supplied by the \"Maschsee Source\" pump station. Its pumping and filtering houses were one of the first building projects at the site of the lake to be put into operation in November 1935. The plant is equipped with two pumps which are capable of raising 500 litres of water every second from the River Leine.\nAs the Leine is strongly contaminated with suspended sediment, the usage of this water supply meant that the Maschsee quickly began to silt up. The Hanover city administration therefore decided in 1960 to build the new pump station at the Ricklingen Ponds, in order to supply the lake with groundwater.\nThe old pumping house is only active today if the oxygen content of the water is too low, as this water is supplied to the lake through an open-air three-stage cascading system that raises oxygen levels. It is also put into use during the Maschseefest.\nToday the old pumping house is used as a club house by the Hanover Sport Club.\n\n\n== Leisure activities ==\n\n\n=== Maschseefest ===\nEvery summer the Maschseefest is held over several weeks beside the lake, which draws around two million visitors annually. The event was first staged in 1986 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Maschee's opening. It features musical performances, cabaret, cuisine and firework displays.\n\n\n=== Boats and ships ===\nDuring the summer months the Hanoverian transport company \u00fcstra operates boat trips on the lake using electrically powered vessels. Surrounding the Maschsee are numerous clubs for water sports (most popularly, rowing and sailing). During the year many diverse competitions are held on the lake, including the annual European Dragon Boat Race.\nBetween 1952 and 1989 motor boat competitions were regularly staged on the lake, which saw four world championships contested and ten European champions crowned.\n\n\n=== Bathing ===\nThe Maschsee Beach lies at the southern point of the lake. The former city open air pool was handed over by the city to a private investor in 2005. They began construction on an expensive commercial \u201cwellness park\u201c, whereupon the project stalled. In 2007 the investor group Aspria took over and continued the work.\nIn spring 2009 Aspria Hannover opened a private spa and sport club in the buildings of the old public facilities and some newly built premises. Aspria also took over the running of the public bathing area though since 2009 over half of the bathing area is only accessible to members of the private Aspria club.\n\n\n=== Exercising ===\nWith its proximity to the centre of Hanover, the Maschsee is a popular recreation area for the city's walkers and joggers. In 2005 a 6 km long route around the lake was mapped out by the German Athletics Association. This track runs along the footpath, closer to the water than the asphalt-coated cycle path. Since 2003 the cycle path has also been open for roller skating usage.\n\n\n=== Ice activities ===\n\nIf the lake freezes in Winter with the thickness of the ice exceeding 13 cm, then the city authorities hoist a flag at the northern shore of the lake to indicate that it is permitted to go onto the ice. In periods of constant cold weather the lake can draw more than 10,000 visitors a day for activities such as ice skating and ice hockey. If the ice thickness reaches 20 cm then stalls can even be erected upon the ice too; this last occurred in 2003.\n\n\n== Art works ==\nNotable works of art on the northern side of the lake are the 6-metre-high (20 ft) red steel \"Hellebardier\" sculpture by Alexander Calder (1972) as well as the bronze Olympic torchbearer that stands atop an 18.5-metre-high (61 ft) stone column and \"Putto on the Fish\" that were both created by Hermann Scheuernstuhl (1936).\nOther sculptures on the eastern side are the \"Menschenpaar\" by Georg Kolbe (1936\u201337) and two lion sculptures created by Arno Breker (1938). In 1948 Erich Haberland unveiled his piece \"The Swimmer\", which stands in the public bathing area.\nSpanish artist Santiago Sierra caused a sensation in 2005 when he remembered the fact that the Maschsee was built through a Nazi work programme by installing a walk-in room filled with mud at the Kestner Society Art Gallery.\nA light art project was held around the lake at the start of 2009 under the title \"New Moon on the Lake\". The display consisted of 22 illuminated pieces that had been created by international artists, which formed the opening of the 2009 Garden Project in Hanover.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Accessibility ==\n\nThe Maschsee lies close to such other notable places as the New City Hall, the Lower Saxony State Museum, the Sprengel Museum, the AWD-Arena (home of the football club Hannover 96), the main city indoor swimming pool as well as the Lower Saxony broadcasting houses of television channels NDR and ZDF.\nThe lake is directly accessible by using the bus stops at the AWD Arena and the Sprengel Museum. Additional bus and tram stops such as the Aegidientorplatz, Schl\u00e4gerstra\u00dfe, Geibelstra\u00dfe, Altenbekener Damm and D\u00f6hren Tower also lie in relatively close proximity to the lake.\nNumerous foot and cycle paths lead to the Maschsee and follow along its shoreline. The western side of the lake, where the club houses of numerous water sport clubs are situated, is only accessible by foot or cycle as vehicles are not permitted without official permission.\n\n\n== References ==\nPress Office, City of Hanover (1936).

        "wiki": "Hanover (; German: Hannover [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250] (listen); Low German: Hannober) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Lower Saxony. Its 535,061 (2017) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen. Hanover's urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen, Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 (2018). The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants (2019).The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine (progression: Aller\u2192 Weser\u2192 North Sea) and its tributary Ihme, in the south of the North German Plain, and is the largest city in the Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg, Dortmund, Essen and Bremen.\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg (1636\u20131692), the Electorate of Hanover (1692\u20131814), the Kingdom of Hanover (1814\u20131866), the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia (1868\u20131918), the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia (1918\u20131946) and of the State of Hanover (1946). From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (later described as the Elector of Hanover).\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne) and north-south (Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich) directions. Hannover Airport lies north of the city, in Langenhagen, and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School with its university hospital (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover) and the Leibniz University Hannover.\nThe Hanover fairground, owing to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover.\n'Hanover' is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation, with stress on the first syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean 'high (river)bank', though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving town privileges in 1241, owing to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.\nIn the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.\nIn 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837) the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837) there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.\nDuring the Seven Years' War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAfter Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.\nIn 1837, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustus, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht (9 November 1938). On that day, the synagogue of Hanover, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.\nIn September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. \nAfter the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAs an important railroad and road junction and production centre, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (St\u00f6cken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945. The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.\nToday Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHannover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) independent of the isotherm. Although the city is not on a coastal location, the predominant air masses are still from the ocean, unlike other places further east or south-central Germany.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\n==== Districts ====\nMitte\nVahrenwald-List\nBothfeld-Vahrenheide\nBuchholz-Kleefeld\nMisburg-Anderten\nKirchrode-Bemerode-W\u00fclferode\nS\u00fcdstadt-Bult\nD\u00f6hren-W\u00fclfel\nRicklingen\nLinden-Limmer\nAhlem-Badenstedt-Davenstedt\nHerrenhausen-St\u00f6cken\nNord\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nNordstadt\nS\u00fcdstadt\nOststadt\nZoo (for the zoo itself, see Hanover Zoo)\nHerrenhausen\nKronsberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nOne of Hanover's most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen.

          "Good for a lazy day out with kids, lot to place to sit, walk, relax, it might be little crowded in summer but still u will enjoy. It's just in walkable distance from ubahn .",
          "Despite its vintage look, Hanover's New Town Hall is a young building. By historical standards, of course... The building is built on 6000 beech piles designed by Hermann Eggert. It was discovered by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1913, a year before world war I, which ended empires in",
          "Nice place to visit. The building is impressive and I was more impressed inside when I seen what damages had the city after the war",

          "A great place to visit and enjoy the architecture of the city! The views from the tower are astonishing! Hannover is a beautiful city indeed!",
          "A place not to be missed while in Hannover; beautiful architecture dated back to 1930. Special to mention is the unique tilting lift which takes you to the observatory level where you get a splendid view of the city and the lake behind.",
          "While we think this new town hall looks typical German architecture in Wilhelmine period, it is the way it was built that perplexes us. Built on 6,026 beech piles and crowned with dome tower the build will give you a good memory after your visit. A view from top is great",
          "The Neues Rathaus or New City Hall is a magnificent castle like building. Built in 1913, but rebuilt after being heavily damaged in World War Two. The building is an amazing eclectic style of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic, Romanticism with the interiors heavily inspired by",

          "The over 100 years old town hall is one of the most magnificent buildings in Hannover. The dome lift is an unique one with its arched course. Long waiting time on weekends.",
          "In the Neues Rathaus it is possible to take an extraordinairy elevator to the top of the tower. The elevator goes a bit steep and that's impressive. From the top: very lovely views",
          "The building is very well kept, you can have great views of the City, once you take the lift, you\u2019ll still need to walk a couple of flight of stairs, yet not too bad. Downstairs they have a small ice cream-coffee shop where you can get small meals & coffee. The area also has a",
          "Visited the New Town Hall in the blistering heat. Really cool place to visit, we had a 30 minute wait for the lift to go to the top, but it was well worth it. Stunning views of the City from the top.",
          "Stunning building and surroundings. I highly recommend accessing the central tower/roof which only cost \u20ac3.50. The 'tilting' lift with multiple viewing panels was an interesting (and slightly alarming - if like me you are no keen on lifts) and there are several viewing levels.",
          "It was a Historic and beatifull Place with a huge garden. The lake in ga5den is also awesome. I Reccomend",
          "Free entry. Model of the city during different stage of history. Nice spot to rest your feet on the steps of the hall and take in its grandness.",
          "My biggest regret is that I didn't have the courage to take a ride in the red-door \"lift with a difference\" - this will necessitate another visit to Hannover I suspect. After you've finished doing the history inside explore the beautiful gardens and lake outside",
          "One of the best free sights in Hannover are the four small models in the main hall of the new townhall that show how Hannover looked at different times in the past.",

          "A massive old and interesting building. Easy to access and very impressive to look at. Well worth a visit with a lovely coffee shop.",
          "We visited on a lovely sunny day and went to the top of the dome - the lift goes up a track which is slightly curved and you can see through the floor which is pretty cool. I'd recommend this, the views are great and it's a good way to orientate yourself.",
          "Certainly worth visiting but for me the view did not compensate the time waiting in the queue to go up and down. Skip if your time is limited.",
          "The view is great. However, it took 45 minutes to get in the lift to the tower. Only five persons are allowed to be in the lift at the same time.",
          "Its not a bad place definitely worth visiting if you are in town - nice architecture - some good scale models of the city",
          "We had a wonder around the town hall to kill some time while we were waiting for a friend. We wanted to go up in the lift for a view of the city but there was a 90 minute wait.. it was very busy with several coaches outside. The town hall is a lovely building - but not really a",
          "Worth queuing to take a trip up in the lift to see the amazing views from the top. Beautiful building, perfectly restored.",
          "History, elegance and amazing surroundings! We have been there several times with our friends and family. Definitely worth a visit!",

          "this town hall is one of the most visited spots of Hanover and not without a reason. It is visible from a distance and the red trail runs by it and also the hop-on hop-off buses stop here. The building is the new old town hall which looks like a castle with a high dome on top",
          "Well worth a visit. Of great historical interest & views from the tower. The rear of the building backs onto a lake.",
          "It's free, it's a beautiful building and it's easy to get to from the centre of the city, so why not visit? We spent an hour or so here - the stairs and inside of the main dome are wonderful and it was interesting to see with the help of the 4 historical models how the city has",
          "We were told to visit this site. the new town hall . Close to a beautiful small lake. Interesting pre and post war history",
          "Stopped in to see the Rathaus. In the main lobby, there are 4 diaramas of the city stretching from the 1700s to the modern day. It's very interesting to see how the city changed and the destruction caused during WWII. The Rathaus also has a tour to the spire of the building",
          "The new (Rathaus) Town Hall is on the banks of a small lake. It is outside of the main centre where the old Rathaus is. Bot towers at the ends are in scaffolding when we went.",
          "What a stunning building! We walked there from our hotel near Hannover hauptbahnhof via the Red Thread (red line painted on the road that serves as a self guided walking tour). The building itself is magnificent and usually you can take the lift to the top of the dome but sadly",
          "Local friends live near the Neue Rathaus (and \"new\" is a relative term because the building is still very old!) So we took a stroll, wandering through the foyer. The city models from different times were eye-opening, especially since 80% of the city was destroyed in WWII. Then",
          "This palace is the actual town hall. It's a beautiful place to visit and to Walk around the park for free. Actually in restauration you can't visit the tour which I was told that offers a beautiful sightsee of Hannover city.",
          "This was my highlight of my short trip to Hannover. The view from the dome was well worth the queue in the cold outside (although the lift made me feel a little wobbly at times!) I visited in October, and the views over Hannover with all of the autumnal colours was simply",
          "I didn't get a chance to go inside the city hall, but I enjoyed the view of the building from the park.",
          "This place offers a lot of information about II World War and there is a maquette of the city which shows us how big and organised this city was during that horrible period.",
          "The place look so nice with a small lake around the area. Outside, the architectural design looks so nice, while inside, its have four miniature area maps showing the development of the city before, during, and after the war, and finally, the new City of Hanover.",
          "We had a lovely trip here. Inexpensive tickets to the the top to see stunning views over Hannover. Approx 7 steps to the quirky lift then you have to go up a spiral staircase to the first level. You can then choose to walk more steps to go higher. No disabled access to the top.",
          "you must travel the glass elevator to reach the top and admire the views from up high, 360 degree view of hannover",
          "Rathaus, the Hannover city hall building is one of the most beautiful civic buildings you'll see anywhere. We decided to undertake a day's stop-over in the city of Hannover as part of our Europe wide tour and we were not disappointed. We headed into the city centre and found a",

          "Definitely I will return to Rathaus as much as I can when I would be in Hannover. The lift is unique and see Hannover from above is great, the mosaics as well. From outside the building is a Masterpiece, the s\u00edmbolo of Hannover, but city models - 1689, 1939, 1945 and actual) are",
          "Fine decoration and part of history. But instead of taking pictures of Hannover City Hall (Rathaus) try walking routes around Rathaus. You get different point of view and there you find lot of benches to rest.",
          "The rathouse is a must see, there you can see the history of Hannover made in four models and it is for free. You can go up the doom and see the panoramic view of the see, should not be missed. The curved left that gets you up there is very interesting",
          "Have to visit this beautiful rathaus, in the day and night. nice area around to walk and spend some time looking the lights.",
          "We chose a set meal which was excellent the staff very attentive, where we sat we had a good view of the lake we did start outside but the wasps were a pest so they took inside which was better.",

          "This place was a wonderful surprise for us. We paid only a few euros top go to the top. A regular lift took us up three storeys. We then entered a small elevator which took us the rest of the was in a shaft shaped to follow the curve of the dome. It had a glass ceiling and",
          "Staying close to the Rathaus we went in. They have an observation platform. The views are outstanding of the whole of Hannover. In the building there are models of Hannover pre war and after. There is also a model of Hannover today. Note there are 2 lifts to the top. The first",

          "The Rathaus is a great building with history. The building itself is magnificent but the models of Hannover before WW2, and after WW2 really show the destruction that occurred. Then there is the present day model which shows how the city has been rebuilt.",

          "This restaurant looking out over beautiful gardens is a great place to relax with a drink or meal. Just don't get lost inside the incredible Rathaus itself if you're looking for the loo. Mind you, it's such an amazing building, it might be worth it!",

          "Tremendous looking building, somewhat out of proportion given the size of Hannover as a city. But that's what you get when British royal family have roots in your city. It's free to enter, and interior is equally amazing, with great miniatures how city looked and developed",
          "This is a magnificent gothic building. It looks far older then what it is, being opened in 1913 and known as the new town hall. It towers almost a hundred metres high and is a really fine and detailed building that perfectly represents the city. Although heavily damaged in WW2",

One of them and definitely a must see is the \u201enew\u201c town hall (which is more than 100 years old anyway). First of all it\u2019s a stunning building, whe you see it, you predict it is",

          "Absolutely stunning city hall building. Spare some time to enter inside and wonder around multiple floors of this wonderful building which is free of charge. City models at the ground floor give a nice idea how Hanover has expanded since the middle ages and how much it has been",

          "Seemigly, this is the second on the list of place to visit in Hanover... Not in my esteem. The building is nice to look at from the front, and in the lobby, but the view from the side with the lake, is all covered in workmens sheets, and the lift was closed or winter. The 4",
          "Also referred to as the New Town Hall Or Neues Rathaus (I like that a Government Building is called a Rat House:-). It\u2019s an amazing building both inside and out and is free to visit but you must buy a ticket to ride the lift. Buy the ticket when you first enter otherwise",

          "First be clear this is the Neues Rathaus (not to be confused with the Altes Rathaus) approached across a very wide and busy road. But once in see the wonderful space with magnificent staircases and space. Difficult to realise that it is the functioning town hall. Then go out",

          "Take a photo and relax :) Beautiful peacefull and this is what you need uf you're going to avoid public",
          "Visited in Feb but would like to go again but in summer as you get to see more and do more. It was still a nice day to go and explore the zoo. It took about two hours to see everything although you could spend much longer. Definitely recommended if you are going to Hannover",
          "Rathaus is a place you must visit when in Hannover. The nearby lake and the building itself in and out are beautiful. A place to remember !",
          "It is the main attraction in Hannover, you can go around event if Rathaus is closed. You can go to the tower or simply go inside for free.",
          "A true architectural masterwork, the New Town Hall is one of Hannover\u2019s most iconic landmarks and most sought-after photographs. After a construction period of twelve years, it was ceremonially inaugurated on July 20, 1913. The building is a grand but elegant structure from",
          "Beautiful building with lots of architectural and art details. One can spend a lot of time admiring all of this delicate work.",
          "Cafe/Bistro hidden out the back over looking at the water was good to find after a walk round the lake. The walks about 45 mins and is worthwhile",
          "Impressive structure and architecture, shame there was scaffolding covering it, nice walk around the lake at the back.",
          "Really enjoyed strolling around the grounds. There is a lovely lake and the Rathaus architecture is nice.",
          "A lovely building with panoramic views from the roof. Take the small lift which costs a few euros to the top. The lift shaft is at an angle so it's a strange experience on the way up and down! The views over Hannover and the Maschsee Lake are lovely and provide good photo",
          "great for a hour or two, when you enter you have models in the centre showing Hannover from its humble begginings through to today, how it has grown and how iy was almost distryed during the war, then rebuilt. It is worth if visiting spending the time and money to go to the top",
          "From the outside the building is magnificent with a lot of nice details. However the real surprise is inside. I suggest to go in, I will not share to many details because I do not want to spoil the surprise. Go to the first floor via the main staircase and go back down via the",
          "Beautiful building inside and out. A MUST DO is the trip to top of Dome. Great cafe/restaurant too. Models of city are well worth seeing too.",
          "We went on the city tour and this was our first stop, i must say this place was breathtakingly beautiful. I felt like i was in a castle in a movie, or an old cathedral, beautiful, amazing. Its a must see",
          "We randomly arrived at the town hall during a wedding which was quite strange but fun! We were still able to walk around and see the amazing interior. The queue to go to the dome was an hour long so we waited until the next day and arrived early. The view was spectacular and",
          "Our visit to this site was a real surprise. We expected it to be an outside - view only of its nice fa\u00e7ade. Usually, we shy away from climbing towers that have stairs only, and we were delighted to find that this Town Hall tower offered an elevator. It is small, and only 5-6",
          "The Rathaus offers amazing Hannover city's Ariel view (3D map) before and after world war. You can clearly identify and see how the city was looked like before and after world war. It's really fascinating. If u are in Hannover , do visit this place!!!",
          "Nice and lively place. Good for photography. Max spend 30mins. Easily accessible n walkable from Hanover Hauptbahnhof central station via the Kropcke market area. Nothing exciting for families with kids though. History lovers will love it. Don't miss to visit the Old Church",
          "It is indeed a must place to visit. The building is beautiful, inside as well. You have to take the elevator up to the tower to see 360\u00b0 view. The elevator is unique, has an inclination of 70%. The view is fantastic.",
          "You'll have a beautiful view of the town and the surrounding gardens, plus the inside is exciting too and there's a nice modell of what Hannover looked like before WWII and of what got destroyed.",
          "The grounds are stunningly beautiful and clean. Worth a picnic by the lake if time allows. Inside, an absolute must see (and free), are the dioramas of Hannover's early beginnings, pre and post WWII, and as a modern city. My wife took the lift while I was working (3Euro) and",
          "Such a nice place to find the history of the area and the wonderful German legacy. Everything is well cared for and enjoyable for all to see and for many well worth the trip.",
          "Interesting diversion for a couple of hours. Depending on number of people you may need to wait thirty minutes or more to get up the lift to the top as it can only take five people each time. Great views across Hannover, slightly disorientating you are so high. Only three euro.",
          "It is a majestic building. The view from the back across the water body is even more beautiful ! Unfortunately I did not go inside, didn't have the time :-(.",
          "Its worth a visit to the Rathaus in Hannover for at least two reasons, firstly travel on the worlds only curving elevator, this runs internal in the skin of the dome and takes you to a look out at the top, interesting engineering built in the early 20th century and still",
          "For us that very seldom experience green open space, this place is so great to spend with your family. They have small ponds and you can feed the ducks. You also can enjoy the mini Hannover inside the Rathaus. They have small parks outside so your children also can enjoy",
          "This building is beautiful - inside and out. We went about half an hour before they closed the inside but that was plenty of time to look at the beautiful architecture - and its free! You can literally wander around, upstairs and down and along the lovely mezzanine floors",
          "We chanced upon this whilst wandering and were blown away by the views from the top of the dome - and the lift ride up! This is worth a visit only \u20ac3 a head. There are stairs involved, about 4 flights. Choose your day as the views of the surrounding area are worth it. The 2nd",
          "We didn't go into the rathaus, but the exterior and the setting was fantastic,it's set in a beautiful little Park but a stones throw from the busy city, the weather when we were there was hot! So it was an ideal place to spend an hour or so just relaxing in the shade and taking",
          "Stunning architecture inside and out. Free to the public and open 7 days a week (check website for hours). Located on the first floor are 4 different representations of Hannover from 1600's to the present day which was very interesting to see. View from the top is stunning!",
          "What a gorgeous piece of architecture sitting by a lake. It's free to the public and the inside is just as beautiful as it is on the outside. Has 4 scale models of Hannover pre and post WWII (1865, 1939, 1945 and present day). Lots of marble, crystal chandeliers... Gorgeous. You",
          "Definitely worth popping in. It is beautiful and has a model of the city c 1939. It would have been even more beautiful. The lift is unique in that it curves along the inside of the copper dome. This changes your balance a bit but that is all. The views are pretty stunning,",
          "Interesting free exhibition inside on the growth, bombing and subsequent rebuilding of Hannover. Stunning views from the top of the dome - well worth the 3Euro lift fee",
          "A historic part of Hannover. Its architecture is absolutely stunning and the view shouldn't be missed. You'll get to see the replica of Hannover before, during, and after the war and present day Hannover. Do not go here and miss going to the top. It is only \u20ac3 for adults and",
          "I went to the city hall and it seems there is nothing in the interior. However, when you go up to the top and see the city view, you would not regret coming to the city hall. The ticket for the visit to the top must be purchased at the ground floor of city hall. There is 360",
          "Inside the big hall you\u00b4ll find models of the city in different times of history but having good weather you should not miss to get a view over the city from the top. The elevator going up is a technical rarity because it doesn\u00b4t go up directly but on a rail connected to the",
          "Easy to walk to from the station and surrounding areas. You can enter and participate in a talk for a fee",
          "Visiting the beautiful town hall and surrounding grounds is well worth a visit and free to the public. You can also visit the bell tower by taking the unusual lift up for three euros.",
          "A striking building near to the Maschsee The Rathaus gives the best views over the City from its cupola summit - which is accessed from a unique parabolic lift which takes you up the side of the Dome. Inside, on the ground floor, are four striking models of the City from the",
          "Not able to go inside since i came late. Just walked around this building. The building itself was very beautiful and huge. There is a beautiful pond behind this building which is a nice place to spend time with friends and family.",
          "A excellent and historical building with a great look as architecture. One of the most of visiting from this place is visiting of city maquettes which have been built to show the view of Hannover city in different ages and years. Especially the view of Hannover during WWII",
          "The building itself is 'just' old majestic rathaus. Anyway there are 2 things why you may visit it: - 4 city models (oldest [hundreds years back] and then before and after 2nd war and modern city) - tower with the best view and funny lift to get there",
          "Love visiting this place for the free bathrooms, classy cafe, amazing models of the city development including the war damage, and the view over the pond and gardens behind it. Best part is the tower elevator for \u20ac3 where you get the best 360\u00b0 view of the city!",
          "The building is so nice. It attracts a big number of tourist and it is a major spot for picnic, tours in that area.",
          "We visited this attraction, and had a good look around. It is free entry, and has good disabled access, you can go up the tower for a small fee, but have to queue as they only allow five up at a time. I wouldn't advise it for those with a walking disability as it's a very narrow",
          "It is free to visit, but you must pay if you want to go up the tower. However, it has very strange and exciting diagonally going elevator, and the view is beautiful, so it is definitely worth visiting.",
          "If you want a decent picture you should go around the park. The beautiful weather added to the entire experience.",
          "Its beautiful, great for pictures, theres a tower to see all hannover (they charge 3 euros to go) totally worth it, theres scale models of the city during certain years even after the bombing",
          "There are many things that you can do at the New Town Hall. You can take a walk around its magnificent exterior, taking time to admire the domes, the architecture, the murals and the sculptures. You can go inside and see the 4 models of Hannover city - from the 17th century to",
          "Many tour books include a walking tour of the rebuilt \"Old Town\". They basically follow a well-maintained red-line (red thread) in the road that travels around the Rathaus (New / Old Town Hall) and it's pond, down to Maschsee where you might see rowers and through the Masch",
          "This is a fantastic piece of architecture. Unfortunately we were too early to go inside. Make your way to the old city hall after this.",
          "This place was not only architecturally amazing but very beautiful! It is open to the public and to visitors and has a lot of historical information inside as well. Large models of the city over it's history from the 1600's till now. Highly recommended!",
          "Well worth paying the couple of euros to go to the top of the neues Rathaus. The view is absolutely stunning but definitely not suited to those with a fear of heights!",
          "We were new to Hanover and spotted the Rathaus quite easily. Driving round the building, we easily found a parking spot behind it. There were lots of trees and shrubs nearby as well as a lake and the air was so pure and invigorating - I guess that must be due to the oxygen",
          "This impressive structure is well worth a walk around inside. It won't take long, and it has 4 fascinating 3D models of the city at different historical times. It's free, too.",
          "The Hannover City Hall is such a good preserved building that you feel present and the past is coming together. Together with some of the other old church building Hannover is a great place to walk around. It is also close to the Maschsee, which makes it a worthwhile place to",
          "Visited in May. The building itself is impressive and is situated next to an attractive lake. Good views from the top. Thought provoking displays of Hanover before and after the 2 nod world war. Devastation makes you realise both sides suffered badly in this dreadful war",
          "I have been there several times with friends and family. Very nice place for photos and walking. A must if you visit Hannover.",
          "If you are looking to see Hanover this is the place you can spot everything from the top, the elevator is very funny. On the entrance floor they have 4 city plans from different years and we can have a perspective of what have happen in the 2 world war, it's impressive. I",
          "We visited this on Mayday and the park was lovely and peaceful in contrast to the protest the other side of the town hall, a beautiful lake reflecting the facade of the Rathaus. There are many wildfowl on the lake and they take care of the nesting birds",
          "Having spent a lot of time in Hannover I can genuinely say that the Rathaus is a real focal point of the city and the setting for a range of events throughout the year. The inside is worth a look and free to get in. There are some poignant models showing Hannover at certain",
          "the hannover city hall ist one of the most beautiful ones in all of europe, definately worth a visit (inside and outside) including the surrounding parks and attractions as well",

          "This ornate town hall offers a range of tourist facilities and has a attached bar and restaurant with outside tables. At the back of the Rathaus is the Maschsee with surrounding park. Walk through here to reach the HDI Stadium and Sch\u00fctzenfestplatz.",
          "A very interesting building that is made to look old when its really not. There are 4 exhibits of Hanover in different years that shows the pre and post WWII devastation of the city.",
          "This building is stunning from the inside and out. The front and back are equally spectacular, but the rear with the lakes would be my favourite. Inside they offer 4 miniatures of the city of different stages. The one of post ww2 is very haunting but poignant also. The main",
          "We visited on a gorgeous Spring day & were able to enjoy the blossoming flowers in the park on the doorstep of the city hall. Sat out on the laws and took in the beautiful views & impressive architecture of the building.",
          "The building was worth a visit. There are 4 models of the city at different periods of its history in the main entrance. Yhe tilting lift is also a nice experience, it takes you right to the top where you can see the whole city. The staff is very kind, only 5 people at the time",
          "The city hall of Hannover is a nice place to visit. Good to families, children and kids too. The building is most beautiful place in Hanover on front of Lake.",
          "The city hall is a highlight of Hannover. The building is imposing, one can walk in the park and it is near to the market and railway station.",
          "Very impressive building, a true symbol of the city and the visit if free. A travel to Hannover is not complete without at least seeing the City Hall and a short walk in its park, which is very picturesque and provides beautiful spots for taking photos.",
          "A good one for architecture buffs & definately worth a trip to see the models of the city over the years, particularly pre & post 1939-45.",
          "This is a beautiful building, especially for pictures but we didn't go in. It was a Sunday evening and not possible.",
          "Beautiful architecture and a super view from the top; try to join a guided tour and learn about the different stages of the city through the various eras. Lovely setting and beautiful garden.",
          "Friends suggest we stop at the Rathaus to take the lift up to the viewpoint from which you can see the entire city, unfortunately the lift is closed in the winter. So we wandering through the lower floors, tagging onto a tour group and had a look at the models of the city from",
          "I only saw this building at night but it was beautiful - worth a look. Would have liked to see in the daylight",
          "A beautiful looking building outside and some very interesting marble work inside, the gardens are beautiful even I. The snow, the lake was iced over and looked wonderful.",
          "Open to the public also on Saturdays this is an amazing Rathaus. Huge corridors, a staircase that does not seem to end and very interesting the birds view on the town before and after the second world war and today.",
          "This is a must-see in Hannover. You will want to be sure and take the slated elevator to the top of the tallest tower for an impressive view of Hannover on a clear day!",
          "With a guide we were inside the building and saw the maquette that is inside the hall. The archetecture is worth to have a stop here and to go inside. (When it is allowed)",
          "Nearly everything is closed on a Sunday. No hop on, hop bus no shops open. But the Railway stn. Has little shops and loads of cafes so we made our way there but it was a wasted day. my favourite place was Munster. Beautiful churches and plenty of shops and restaurants.",
          "One of the major sights of Hannover.Opened by the Kaiser in 1913.The Mayor of Hannover apparently said to the Kaiser,\"All built with cash,Majesty.\"The Rathaus was one of the few buildings to survive the heavy bombing of Hannover.It is a very impressive sight ,which rather",
          "This is one od those places which you need to see. This is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Hanover.",
          "Beautiful building and pleasantly interesting. Amazing miniature scale creations of Hannover before during and after the war. Climb all the way up the stairs and explore. It's just incredible",
          "It's a great building with lake and park nearby. A favorite place for locals and tourists to relax on nice weather. Best time to take picture is right after the sunset but before getting too dark.",
          "Excellent place. they also have a lift to the viewing platforms. Narrow lift with glass floor and roof.",
          "Find this magnificent building along the interesting Red Thread walk. An amazing building with very interesting history of Hannover. Jaw dropping scale models of the city show the massive destruction brought to Hannover City by the 1945 bommings.",
          "We visited the Rathaus with a 4-year old in tow, and whilst it was extremely interesting to learn about the history of Hannover and it's environs, the 'small person' didn't seem to agree. Which is understandable. That aside, the building is beautiful and has some wonderful,",
          "I stayed at a Hotel a few minutes walk from the Hannover 'Rathaus' whilst in Germany on business and took a walk over one morning to look this magnificent building over. Built in 1901 to 1913 this is a major landmark and attraction with the top of its dome standing reaching",
          "A just superb city hall. A great building inside and out. Beautifull details. Do go inside for the models of old Hannover and informative also of the era of WOII (Hannover was bombed severly) Also go up the central tower for gorgeous views of the city and surroundings",
          "All and all this is a very beautiful building but what people don't realise is they have a canteen in the basement that is open to the General public! Very good value for money and I fully recommend that people come here for lunch! Enjoy",
          "On April 2014 I travelled to Hannover to meet my German friend and I asked him to bring me to the place he wanted to show. He chose City Hall, of course! We bought a ticket to the top of the Dome, I could not remember what the price was but I am sure it's worth for!! Even the",
          "The New Town Hall is a tremendously amusing building. It has Scottish Baronial, Gothic and Dutch touches to a very confident German style. With a giant Roman dome plonked on a Gothic tower, Quite remarkable. The interior is in a style familiar to all those grand Edwardian",
          "Nice place fro relaxation at taking photos, especially during sunsets, around the little lake there is jogging way",

          "A symbol of Hannover, the Neues Rathaus is worth visiting mostly at night because it is so bright iluminated. If you take a stroll around the Rathaus in the evening and sit on a banch you can easily found that the gardens are filled with rabbits, rodens and other happy birds who",
          "A freebie! How nice! The building is really quite imposing. Interiors are fairly grand. But the best part of it has to be the city models both before and after the bombing. So sad, it almost brought me to tears. Such a shame it had to be bombed. Walking around the city",
          "A must see. The main floor has models of Hannover through out history. The park out back is spectacular!",
          "A peek into German life over the ages. Worth a visit if your in Hannover, make sure you visit the Marchsee behind it if you are there.",
          "I've been to Hanover several times and always make sure to swing by here. It's not hard to get to yet feels remote due to proximity to the lake. Wonderful for a stroll or picnic!",
          "Pity we only had time to visit it shortly on our walking tour. The area is adorable. The building has fascinating architecture and the water at its back enhances its splendor. In the inner court there is also a set of 'mini' hannover to give you an idea of how it looked like",

          "We visited the City Hall as we wanted to see the lake and found it to be a very interesting visit. This is a lovely, very large building with interesting architecture. There are models showing present day Hannover, the very start of Hannover and Hannover after it was bombed",
          "Although it is just a building, it looks like a castle. Nice as an attraction. I hadn't enough time to go inside but nevertheless it looks great.",
          "This is one of Germany's most interesting buildings. The models of the bombed city in the entrance hall make visitors reflect on 20th century German history and perhaps more understanding of Hannover's terrible post-war city planning. Taking the lift up in summer is wonderful",
          "The view is nice, worth a visit.! You get to take the elevator that doesnt go up straight. It has a slight tilt, one of a kind experience. :) Was in the queue for about 20mins or so though!",
          "Good place to look around and visiting the tour. The garden around the back is well worth exploring too.",
          "Excellent park to enjoy a picnic in. Allow good time to go up the tower to view the city skyline. Remember to buy a ticket in the shop before using the lift and joining the queue",
          "What a gorgeous city hall. A beautiful building on a beautiful property and with great views. The architecture is pretty impressive. It was also interesting to see inside a miniature display of Hannover how it looked at the end of WWII when a lot of it was destroyed and how it",
          "Coming from a city full of skyscrapers, I was swept away by the beauty of this old structure. I took awhile to even get into the building as I was way too busy admiring the exterior. Carefully sculpted sculptures, the designs - beautiful! Once inside, you will be able to see 4",

          "The building is beautiful in and outside. It has a unique lift to the highest tower with an amazing view",
          "It is just in the middle of the city, surrounded by a beautiful park. If you pass by Hannover you should just walk there, jogging is an option but you may just sit in the green grass and enjoy your time",

          "This is a nice building. The exhibit showing 17th century Hannover, 1939 Hannover, 1945 bombed city and the present day in 4 very detailed models is outstanding. Very powerful. The trip to the top in the elevator is fun too. Unless you're afraid of heights. Then you're in",
          "This was part of the red thread tour. Grounds were beautiful. When you go inside there are miniature layouts of the town from different eras. You can go up to the roof but buy your tickets first.",
          "Fabulous architecture , and not to be missed if you are in Hannover. An impressive edifice indeed . At night it is well lit and is also on a fabulous park",
          "I hope you have a wonderful weather like I did, when you visit, so that you can see the shape of the Rathaus reflected in the water. Walk about and enjoy it, it is worth it. Enter the Rathaus and take the lift - it's a funny experience (and cheap). Only problem I had to wait",
          "It was almost fairy tale looking across the small lake at the view of the building. People picnicked or just relaxed, and couples strolled. Quite romantic! We happened upon the 2015 Hannover \"Das Diner en Blanc\" on the boulevard, with traffic on either side, in front of the",

          "Ok so this is not specifically the Rathaus but we were there. I find it necessary to review the city or at least the central area where we were located near Lister Platz and Kroepke. We were disappointed to see so many grim faces. These people are not happy. This so a convention",
          "Interesting place to visit and see the maps of the city in the lobby (they show the city at various points in its history--these are not wall maps, but are miniature 3d depictions and fairly good size). Take the elevator to view the city from the tower--its worth the few extra",

          "The structures is so great, they have this elevator that can go up to the top and see the view of Hannover city in 360 degrees. I read their history where they wrote it in the walls. So amazing that their city is dominated by the Protestants. Surroundings of the Rathaus is like",
          "One of the Hannover's landmark, the Rathaus is a very beatiful building, that deserve any tourist attention. Also the interiors are very nice, but the biggest attraction is the view from the tower (3E/person or 2 Euro for students) - it totally worth it.",

          "In addition to the beatiful construction and architectural view of this building, one of most important and interesting things for me was the maquette of Hannover city in 4 different times in the past. The maquette of Hannover before and during the WWII show the motivation and",
          "A beautiful building, meant to have a pop in in passing. Ended up spending 2 hours walking around taking photos. Definitely worth going in and walking around the lake. 10/10 considering its just the town hall.",
          "Take the time to go to the top of the tower to see the views: the lift that curves inside the dome is also a great experience and the man in charge very interesting. At the top there is a bit of climbing but nothing too strenuous and once there ther views over Hannover and the",

          "I was here at the tail end of a long tour around Europe and was too broke to go up the elevator to the tower to see the view. Something I sorely regret. However I will return one day to do this. The grounds are quite cool. We were following the red line guide book and ended up",
          "The NEW City Hall, built in the early 20th century, is a classical design. The 4 exhibition cases in the foyer, showing the history of Hannover, have been painstakingly produced - especially the 1945 post war exhibit - so much detail. Well worth a visit.",

          "This is a world-class place to visit. It takes awile to get to the top, but the view around Hannover, one of Germany's nicest, and most thoughtfully reconstructed cities, is brilliant. But just as impressive are the four miniature recreations of Hannover in the lobby, at four",

          "Enjoy the view from the top and see the Maschsee and Niedersachsenstadion/HDI-Arena where Hannover96 is based. The price of 3\u20ac is also a bargain. But its not only the view, I love the displays of the different stages of Hannover reflecting the change after the wars and how it",
          "This was a wonderful, yet emotional visit for me. It is an amazing building. Although I am deathly afraid of heights, I made it to the top to see the fabulous view. When I looked at the various models of the city & in particular the one post war, I was overcome with emotion. My",

          "Were due to depart from Hannover airport later the same afternoon and decided to do a de-tour and visit this public building. There is a fee to take the elevator up to one of the viewing points. It cost three euros each. The elevator ride was worth the money. A strange wonky",
          "We were visiting Hannover with friends who were locals so got to see many local places of interest mainly on bike! This is a very lovely building with a very interesting area depicting how Hannover has looked in miniature over different times. Most touching was how Hannover was",

          "Well worth going up in the lift to the top of the dome (3 euros each). Slightly hard to find out how to get there if you dont speak much german though. Enter through the main doors, take the spiral staircase to the left in the main hall, and its signed from the top of there",

          "This is well worth a visit unfortunatly we ran out of time to view to whole of the building. The lift to the tower is the most unusual I have ever been in first the floor slants one way and then it slants the other due to the shaft not bing straight, but when you get to the top",
          "Well worth a visit. There are 4 models of the city on the ground floor detailing the city through the ages, these are intersting and also an eye opener. Next take yourself up to the viewing platforms in the Willy Wolka esq. lift and marvel at the views from the top.",

          "The city hall, called the New City Hall was built in 1901. Inside you might catch a wedding party. Trips to the tower can have a long wait as only 5 people plus operator can do the elevator which goes up on an incline and has a glass ceiling, floor and walls. On a clear days you",
          "I enjoyed seeing what Hannover looked like over the ages from the mid 1300-s to today. If you have the ability to take panoramic pictures, this is the place to do it!",
          "This is Hannover's most beautiful building - both outside and inside. They have constructed 4 diaroma's in the main foyer to show what Hannover was like in the 1600's, pre-WW 2, post WW 2, and present day. It is very fascinating. You can also go all the way to the top and",

          "This is a beautiful turn of the century building with a lovely setting near the Maschsee. The view from the tower is amazing and with a reasonable price (not for the faint of heart though, as the last bit requires some climbing--it uses elevators and a stair case at the end).",
          "It was amazing! You could see the entire city. It is a great spot to visit, you'll get to see all the amazing buildings in hannover, plus the elevator is an amazing experience. It's a bit small, so if your claustrophobic, you might not want to go.",
          "While walking along the touristic red line of Hannover I came across the city hall. Walking in I was very impressed by the design and grandeur of the building. You can see the work which was put into recreating a building in an old style. The lobby houses a few miniature",
          "The New Town Hall is worth a visit as it is a very impressive building. Take the time to go up to the top either by stairs or pay for the lift as the views of Hannover are worth seeing. Also remember to walk round the back of the Town Hall as the lake and grounds are lovely to",
          "Some minutes from the old town(not much to walk around in this)is the new Rathaus, you must walk around the lake behind it to see the best views.Nice place for a picnic or a family walk.",
          "If you like architecture, you might not want to miss out the old town hall. If you are not... well, you might not fully appreciate its beauty. Inside the town hall, you can walk around old, dusty displays of the city which, sadly enough, some use to dispose of their litter. More",
          "The beautiful and magnificent palace surrounded by green, looks like a castle, but it is one of the most beautiful Germany\u00b4s City Hall.",
          "Although Hannover isn't especially touted as a vacation spot, we found ourselves there recently while researching family ties in nearby Ilten, Germany. During our 2-day stay we found the city to be charming and bustling with activity. One day while walking the \"Red Thread\" that",
          "Awe inspiring building free to look around and a small fee to take the \"horizontal lift\" with a glass roof to the top for great views. The models of medievil Hannover, shortly after the war and today are very sad and make you realise why Hannover has mostly modern architecture.",
          "Hannover is known for its lush, green landscaping & park-like atmosphere. Nestled in the center of this charming city is Rathaus, or City Hall. Rathaus, with its spectacular dome (among many other astonishing features) is a true architectural masterpiece. The interior is as"

        "wiki": "Hanover Square is a square with a public park in the Financial District, Lower Manhattan, New York City.  It is triangular in shape, bordered by Pearl Street, Stone Street (which is now pedestrian-only) and a street named Hanover Square. Most surrounding buildings are primarily commercial.\nThe square's pocket park is maintained by the New York City Department of Parks, and has an area of 0.056 acres (0.023 ha) or 2,440 square feet (227 m2).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe square was known by its current name as early as 1730, during the period of British colonialism.  In 1714, it was named for the House of Hanover, when King George I ascended to the throne.\nThe Queen Elizabeth II Garden (formerly named the British Garden at Hanover Square) was opened in June 2008. A memorial park for those victims of September 11 who were citizens of any Commonwealth realm (i.e., Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.) it was given its broader designation on September 11, 2011. In July 2010, Queen Elizabeth II visited Hanover Square after laying a wreath at the World Trade Center site and meeting with families of the British victims.For many years, Hanover Square was the center of New York's commodity market, with the New York Cotton Exchange at 1 Hanover Square, New York Cocoa Exchange (now the New York Board of Trade) and others located nearby. The square was also known as \"Printing House Square,\" and it was here that the Great Fire of New York broke out on December 16, 1835, decimating much of Lower Manhattan. 3 Hanover Square, a former home to the New York Cotton Exchange, and 10 Hanover Square, a former office building, have been converted to residential use.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe IRT Third Avenue Line elevated railway had a station above the square from 1878 until 1950, when it was deactivated and later dismantled. \nThe fourth stage of the Second Avenue Subway is slated to extend subway service to Hanover Square. Today, the nearest New York City Subway stations are:\nWall Street (2 and \u200b3 trains)\nBroad Street (J and \u200bZ trains)\nSouth Ferry/Whitehall Street (1\u200b, N, \u200bR, and \u200bW trains)\nWall Street (4 and \u200b5 trains)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNYC Parks history of Hanover Square",

The square is situated at the crossroads of Georgstra\u00dfe, Karmarschstra\u00dfe, Bahnhofstra\u00dfe and Rathenaustra\u00dfe. It is named after Wilhelm Kr\u00f6pcke, one of the owners of the former Caf\u00e9 Robby, which was erected on the then-nameless square in 1869. Kr\u00f6pcke leased the caf\u00e9 in 1876, changed the business's name to Caf\u00e9 Kr\u00f6pcke and operated the caf\u00e9 until 1919. Eventually, the square adopted the name from the caf\u00e9 and in 1948 was officially named Kr\u00f6pcke by the city of Hanover.\nOne of its notable features is the Kr\u00f6pcke clock, which is a 1977 replica of an 1885 clock that was scrapped after World War II.\n\n\n== Stadtbahn station ==\n\nThe station Kr\u00f6pcke is the main station in the Hanover Stadtbahn network. It was built from 1968 to 1974 and opened in several parts through the 1970s and 1980s. At the time, it was one of Hanover's largest construction sites, extending more than 30 meters underground. Today, all Stadtbahn lines except two call at the station and it is the main interchange point for the network. It has six platforms in total on three lines that cross each other in independent tunnels.\nLevel -1\nMain entrance and access to  Niki-de-Saint-Phalle-Promenade.\nLevel -2\n\nA line toward Hauptbahnhof and Markthalle.\nB line toward Hauptbahnhof and Aegidientorplatz.\nConnection between A line to Markthalle and B line to AegidientorplatzLevel -2.5\nConnecting level with escalators and staircases to the A, B and C lines.\nLevel -3\n\nC line toward Steintor and Aegidientorplatz.The station underwent extensive modernisation prior to Expo 2000, including hiding its 1970s colours tilework behind large murals.\n\n\n=== Next stations ===\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Goslar is a historic town in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the administrative centre of the district of Goslar and located on the northwestern slopes of the Harz mountain range. The Old Town of Goslar and the Mines of Rammelsberg are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Each year Goslar awards the Kaiserring to an international artist, called the \"Nobel Prize\" of the art world.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGoslar is situated in the middle of the upper half of Germany, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of Brunswick and about 70 km (43 mi) southeast of the state capital, Hanover. The Schalke mountain is the highest elevation within the municipal boundaries at 762 metres (2,500 feet). The lowest point of 175 m (574 ft) is near the Oker river. Geographically, Goslar forms the boundary between the Hildesheim B\u00f6rde which is part of the Northern German Plain, and the Harz range, which is the highest, northern-most extension of Germany's Central Uplands. The Hildesheim B\u00f6rde is characterised by plains with rich clay soils \u2013 used agriculturally for sugar beet farming \u2013 interlaced with several hill ranges commonly known as the Hildesheim Forest and Salzgitter Hills. In the northeast the Harly Forest stretches down to the River Oker, in the east, Goslar borders on the German state of Saxony-Anhalt.\nImmediately to the south, the Harz range rise above the historic borough at a height of 636 m (2,087 ft) at Mt. Rammelsberg. Extended forests dominate the landscape. The major rivers crossing the municipal boundaries are the Oker with its Gose/Abzucht and Radau tributaries. The eponymic River Gose originates approximately 9 kilometres (6 miles) south-west of Goslar at the Auerhahn Pass (638 m (2,093 ft)) east of the Bocksberg mountain. At the northern foot of the Herzberg (632 m (2,073 ft)) it meets the smaller Abzucht stream, before it flows into the Oker. The D\u00f6rpke and Gelmke streams also flow from the Harz foothills to the south into the Goslar municipal area, where they discharge into the Abzucht.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\n(clockwise from the North): Liebenburg, Schladen-Werla (Wolfenb\u00fcttel District), Osterwieck (Harz District, Saxony-Anhalt), Bad Harzburg, Clausthal-Zellerfeld (Oberharz), and Langelsheim.\n\n\n=== Town districts ===\nThe township currently comprises 18 districts (Stadtteile):\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIron ore mining was common in the Harz region since Roman times; the earliest known evidences for quarying and smelting date back to the 3rd century AD. Ancient burial objects made of Harz ore have even been discovered during excavations in England. The settlement on the Gose creek was first mentioned in a 979 deed issued by Emperor Otto II; it was located in the Saxon homelands of the Ottonian dynasty and probably a royal palace (K\u00f6nigspfalz) already existed at the site. It became even more important when extensive  silver deposits were discovered at the nearby Rammelsberg, today a mining museum.\nWhen Otto's descendant Henry II began to convene Imperial synods at the Goslar palace from 1009 onwards, Goslar gradually replaced the Royal palace of Werla as a central place of assembly in the Saxon lands; a development that was again enforced by the Salian (\"Franconian\") emperors. Conrad II, once elected King of the Romans, celebrated Christmas 1024 in Goslar and had the foundations laid for the new Imperial Palace (Kaiserpfalz Goslar) the next year.\nGoslar became the favourite residence of Conrad's son Henry III who stayed at the palace about twenty times. Here he received King Peter of Hungary as well as the emissaries of Prince Yaroslav of Kiev, here he appointed bishops and dukes. His son and successor Henry IV was born here on 11 November 1050. Henry also had Goslar Cathedral erected and consecrated by Archbishop Herman of Cologne in 1051; shortly before his death in 1056, Emperor Henry III met with Pope Victor II in the church, emphasizing the union of secular and ecclesiastical power. His heart was buried in Goslar, his body in the Salian family vault in Speyer Cathedral. Of the cathedral only the northern porch survived; the main building was torn down in the early 19th century.\nUnder Henry IV, Goslar remained a centre of Imperial rule; however, conflicts intensified such as in the violent Precedence Dispute at Pentecost 1063. While Henry aimed to secure the enormous wealth deriving from the Rammlesberg silver mines as a royal demesne, the dissatisfaction of local nobles escalated with the Saxon Rebellion in 1073\u201375. In the subsequent Great Saxon Revolt, the Goslar citizens sided with anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden, who held a princely assembly here in 1077, and with Hermann of Salm, who was crowned king in Goslar by Archbishop Siegfried of Mainz on 26 December 1081. brought Goslar the status of an Imperial City.\nIn Spring 1105 Henry V convened the Saxon estates at Goslar, to gain support for the deposition of his father Henry IV. Elected king in the following year, he held six Imperial Diets at the Goslar Palace during his rule. The tradition was adopted by his successor Lothair II and even by the Hohenstaufen rulers Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa. After his election in 1152, King Frederick appointed the Welf duke Henry the Lion Imperial Vogt (bailiff) of the Goslar mines; nevertheless, the dissatisfied duke besieged the town and at an 1173 meeting in Chiavenna demanded his enfeoffment with the estates in turn for his support on Barbarossa's Italian campaigns. When Henry the Lion was finally declared deposed in 1180, he had the Rammelsberg mines devastated.\nGoslar's importance as an Imperial residence began to decline under the rule of Barbarossa's descendants. During the German throne dispute the Welf king Otto IV laid siege to the town in 1198 but had to yield to the forces of his Hohenstaufen rival Philip of Swabia. Goslar was again stormed and plundered by Otto's troops in 1206. Frederick II held the last Imperial Diet here; with the Great Interregnum upon his death in 1250, Goslar's Imperial era ended.\nWhile the Emperors withdraw from Northern Germany, civil liberties in Goslar were strengthened. Market rights date back to 1025; a municipal council (Rat) was first mentioned in 1219. The citizens strived for control of the Rammelsberg silver mines and in 1267 joined the Hanseatic League. Beside mining in the Upper Harz, commerce and trade in Gose beer, later also slate and vitriol, became important. By 1290 the council had obtained Vogt rights, confirming Goslar's status as a free imperial city. In 1340 its citizens were vested with Heerschild rights by Emperor Louis the Bavarian. The Goslar town law set an example for numerous other municipalities, like the Goslar mining law codified in 1359.\nEarly modern times saw both a mining boom and rising conflicts with the Welf Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, mainly with Prince Henry V of Wolfenb\u00fcttel who seized the Rammelsberg mines and extended Harz forests in 1527. Though a complaint was successfully lodged with the Reichskammergericht by the Goslar citizens, a subsequent gruelling feud with the duke lasted for decades. Goslar was temporarily placed under Imperial ban, while the Protestant Reformation was introduced in the city by theologian Nicolaus von Amsdorf who issued a first church constitution in 1531. To assert independence, the citizens in 1536 joined the Schmalkaldic League against the Catholic policies of the Habsburg emperor Charles V. The Schmalkaldic forces indeed occupied the Wolfenb\u00fcttel lands of Henry V, however, when they were defeated by Imperial forces at the 1547 Battle of M\u00fchlberg, the Welf duke continued his reprisals.\nIn 1577 the Goslar citizens signed the Lutheran Formula of Concord. After years of continued skirmishes, they finally had to grant Duke Henry and his son Julius extensive mining rights which ultimately edged out the city council. Nevertheless, several attempts by the Brunswick dukes to incorporate the Imperial city were rejected. Goslar and its economy was hit hard by the Thirty Years' War, mainly by the Kipper und Wipper financial crisis in the 1620s which led to several revolts and pogroms. Facing renewed aggressions by Duke Christian the Younger of Brunswick, the citizens sought support from the Imperial military leaders Tilly and Wallenstein. The city was occupied by the Swedish forces of King Gustavus Adolphus from 1632 to 1635; in 1642 a peace agreement was reached between Emperor Ferdinand III and the Brunswick duke Augustus the Younger. The hopes of the Goslar citizens to regain the Rammelsberg mines were not fulfilled.\nGoslar remained loyal to the Imperial authority, solemnly celebrating each accession of a Holy Roman Emperor. While strongly referring to its great medieval traditions, the city continuously decreased in importance and got into rising indebtedness. When Johann Wolfgang von Goethe stayed at Goslar in 1777, he called it \"an Imperial city rotted in and with its privileges\". \nIn the winter of 1798, the coldest of the century, the young English poet William Wordsworth stayed in the city. To dispel homesickness he started to write a few verses about his childhood, which would eventually evolve into the masterpiece that was published in 13 volumes after his death as The Prelude.First administrative reforms were enacted by councillors of the Siemens family. Nevertheless, the status of Imperial immediacy was finally lost, when Goslar was annexed by Prussian forces during the Napoleonic Wars in 1802, confirmed by the German Mediatisation the next year. Under Prussian rule, further reforms were pushed ahead by councillor Christian Wilhelm von Dohm. Temporarily part of the Kingdom of Westphalia upon the Prussian defeat at the 1806 Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt, Goslar finally was assigned to the newly established Kingdom of Hanover by resolution of the Vienna Congress. The cathedral was sold and torn down from 1820 to 1822, bitterly mourned by Heinrich Heine in his Harzreise travelogue. Again under Prussian rule after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Goslar became a popular retirement residence (Pensionopolis) and a garrison town of the Prussian Army. The Hohenzollern kings and emperors had the Imperial Palace restored, including the mural paintings by Hermann Wislicenus.\nAfter the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Reich Minister Richard Walther Darr\u00e9 made Goslar the seat of the agricultural Reichsn\u00e4hrstand corporation. In 1936, the city obtained the title of Reichsbauernstadt. In the course of the German re-armament, a Luftwaffe airbase was built north of the town and several war supplier companies located in the vicinity, including subcamps of the Buchenwald and Neuengamme concentration camps. Nevertheless, the historic town escaped strategic bombing during World War II.\nPart of the British occupation zone from 1945, Goslar was the site of a displaced persons camp. During the Cold War era the city near the inner German border was a major garrison town for the West German army, the border police as well as the French Forces in Germany. After the fall of the Berlin wall, the barracks were vacated and a major economic factor was lost. The Rammelberg mines were finally closed in 1988, after a millennial history of mining.\nIn the summer of 2018, a bottled typewritten message dated March 26, 1930 was discovered in the roof of Goslar Cathedral, signed by four roofers who bemoaned the economic state of that country. The bottle was discovered by a roofer who was the grandson of one of the signatories, who had been an 18-year-old roofing apprentice in 1930. Goslar's mayor replaced the bottle with a copy of the 1930 message, adding his own confidential message.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nAs of 30 June 2018 there were 50,943 inhabitants in Goslar.\n\n(count: December 31 of each year)\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Town council ===\nFor the legislature from 1 November 2016 until 31 October 2021, the seats were allocated as follows:\n\nSPD: 14 seats (37.55%)\nCDU: 10 seats (26.10%)\nAfD: 3 seats (9.28%)\nFDP: 3 seats (6.95%)\nGreens: 3 seats (6.70%)\nGoslarer Linke: 2 seats (5.36%)\nBGL: 2 seats (5.02%)\nAfG: 1 seat (1.69%)\n\n\n=== Lord Mayor ===\nDr Oliver Junk was elected as Lord Mayor in September 2011.\n\n\n=== Members of Parliament ===\nEuropean (Constituency: Southern Lower Saxony), Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl (CDU), Erika Mann (SPD)\nBundestag (Constituency 52: Goslar, Northeim, Osterode), First: Wilhelm Priesmeier (SPD), List: Hans Georg Faust (CDU)\nLandtag Lower Saxony (Constituency 16: Goslar), First: Petra Emmerich-Kopatsch (SPD), List: Dorothee Pr\u00fcssner (CDU)\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nGoslar is twinned with:\n\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n\nMemorial to the fallen riflemen of the 10th Hanover Rifle Battalion in the Franco-Prussian War 1870/1871 (now at the Kahnteich)\nMemorial to the fallen riflemen of the 10th Hanover Rifle Battalion in World War I 1914-1918\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nThe Odeon Theatre is the town's major theatre venue.

        "wiki": "Gifhorn (German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0261\u026afh\u0254\u0281n] (listen)) is a town and capital of the district of Gifhorn in the east of Lower Saxony, Germany. It has a population of about 42,000 and is mainly influenced by the small distance to the more industrial and commercially important cities nearby, Brunswick and Wolfsburg. Further, Gifhorn is part of the Hanover-Brunswick-G\u00f6ttingen-Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. The Municipality Gifhorn includes the villages of Gamsen, Gifhorn, K\u00e4storf, Neubokel, Wilsche and Winkel.\nThe oldest verifiable source attests the existence of the city in the year 1196.\nGifhorn is home to the International Wind- and Watermill Museum, which contains a comprehensive collection and working replicas of the world's most common windmills.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGifhorn lies at the confluence of the Rivers Ise and Aller. Gifhorn is situated about 20 km (12 mi) north of the city of Brunswick and about 15 km (9 mi) west of Wolfsburg. In the city, the Bundesstra\u00dfe 4 and 188 meet. At the northern end of the city, the L\u00fcneburg Heath starts.\n\n\n== History ==\nGifhorn was first mentioned in 1196. It was located at the crossing of two then important merchant routes: the salt street (German: Salzstra\u00dfe) being a main trading route for salt between L\u00fcneburg and Brunswick, and the grain street (German: Kornstra\u00dfe) transporting grain between Celle and Magdeburg.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSchools in Gifhorn include the Humboldt Gymnasium, the Otto-Hahn-Gymnasium, Fritz-Reuter-Realschule, Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Realschule, Albert-Schweitzer-Hauptschule and the Berufsbildenden Schulen I and II. Alfred-Teves-Schule, which was called Volksschule S\u00fcd between 1954 and 1958, was open between 1954 and 2010.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe Gifhorn rail station is in the southern part of the town.\nIn the city, the Bundesstra\u00dfe 4 and 188 meet.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nGifhorn is twinned with:\n\n\n== The Bells Palace ==\nGlocken-Palast, or The Bells Palace, is a monument and large building in Gifhorn. It was completed after 16 years of construction, combining various Russian timber building styles.

        "wiki": "Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel (German: Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand; 9 October 1735 \u2013 10 November 1806) was the Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel and Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg and a military leader. His titles are usually shortened to Duke of Brunswick in English-language sources.\nHe succeeded his father as sovereign prince of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, one of the princely states of the Holy Roman Empire. The duke was a cultured and benevolent despot in the model of Frederick the Great, and was married to Princess Augusta, a sister of George III of Great Britain. He was also a recognized master of 18th century warfare, serving as a Field Marshal in the Prussian Army. During the Napoleonic Wars, he was mortally wounded by a musket ball at the Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt in 1806.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nCharles William Ferdinand was born in the town of Wolfenb\u00fcttel on 9 October 1735, probably in Wolfenb\u00fcttel Castle. He was the first-born son of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel and his wife Philippine Charlotte.\nHis father Charles I was the ruling prince (German: F\u00fcrst) of the small state of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, one of the imperial states of the Holy Roman Empire. Philippine Charlotte was the favourite daughter of King Frederick William I of Prussia and sister of Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great). As the heir apparent of a sovereign prince, Charles William Ferdinand received the title of Hereditary Prince (German: Erbprinz).\nHe received an unusually wide and thorough education, overseen by his mother. In his youth he travelled in the Netherlands, France and various parts of Germany. In 1753 his father moved the capital of the principality back to Brunswick (German: Braunschweig), the state's largest city. (Wolfenb\u00fcttel had been the capital since 1432.) The royal family moved into the newly built Brunswick Palace.\n\n\n== Early military career ==\n\nCharles William Ferdinand entered the military, serving during the Seven Years' War of 1756\u201363. He joined the allied north-German forces of the Hanoverian Army of Observation, whose task was to protect Hanover (in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain) and the surrounding states from invasion by the French. The force was initially commanded by the Anglo-Hanoverian Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. At the Battle of Hastenbeck (1757) Charles William Ferdinand led a charge at the head of an infantry brigade, an action which gained him some renown.The subsequent French Invasion of Hanover and Convention of Klosterzeven of 1757 temporarily knocked Hanover out of the war (they were to return the following year). Cumberland was recalled to Britain and the remaining allied north-German forces were placed under the command of Ferdinand of Brunswick, brother of Charles I, who easily persuaded his nephew Charles William Ferdinand to renew his military service as a general officer.Charles William Ferdinand was part of the allied Anglo-German force at the Battle of Minden (1759), and the Battle of Warburg (1760). Both were decisive victories over the French, during which he proved himself an excellent subordinate commander. He continued to serve in the army commanded by his uncle for the remainder of the war, which was generally successful for the north German forces. The hereditary prince's reputation improved throughout, and he became an acknowledged master of irregular warfare. Peace was restored in 1763.\n\n\n== Marriage and travels ==\n\nThe royal houses of the former Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg had traditionally married within the family, to avoid further division of their family lands under Salic law. By the time, Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg had consolidated back into two states, Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel and the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (Hanover). The electorate was ruled by the Hanoverian branch of the family in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain. It was therefore arranged for Charles William Ferdinand to marry a British-Hanoverian princess: Princess Augusta of Great Britain, daughter of Frederick, Prince of Wales and his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and sister of the reigning King George III.In 1764, shortly after the Seven Years' War had ended, he travelled to London (landing at Harwich) to marry Princess Augusta. He received a rapturous welcome from the British people, thanks to his service with allied British troops during the war. The Parliament of Great Britain showed its gratitude by voting him a lump sum of \u00a380,000 and an annual income of \u00a33,000 as a wedding gift. However George III was less welcoming, and sought to express his displeasure through numerous small insults e.g. by lodging the prince at Somerset House, instead of one of the royal palaces; not providing him with a military guard; and instructing the servants at the wedding to wear old clothes. This merely served to exacerbate the enthusiasm of the public, particularly when the prince was suspected of turning his back on the unpopular monarch whilst attending an opera (a breach of social protocol). Charles William Ferdinand defied royal displeasure by meeting William Pitt the Elder (who had been prime minister during the war but resigned in 1761) and the other leaders of the parliamentary opposition. The wedding was completed, but as a result of these machinations the prince remained in Britain for only thirteen days.\n\nOver the next few years the couple embarked on a wide-ranging tour of Europe, visiting many of the major states. In 1766 they went to France, where they were received by both his allies and recent battlefield enemies with respect. In Paris he made the acquaintance of Marmontel. The couple next proceeded to Switzerland, where they met Voltaire. The longest stop on their travels was Rome, where they remained for a long time exploring the antiquities of the city under the guidance of Johann Winckelmann. During their travels the couple also met Pietro Nardini and in 1767 the prince had his portrait painted by Pompeo Batoni. After a visit to Naples they returned to Paris, and thence to Brunswick.\n\n\n== Ruler of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel ==\n\n\n=== Restoration of state finances ===\nHis father, Charles I, had been an enthusiastic supporter of the war, but nearly bankrupted the state paying for it. As a result, in 1773 Charles William Ferdinand was given a major role in reforming the economy. With the assistance of the minister Feon\u00e7e von Rotenkreuz he was highly successful, restoring the state's finances and improving the economy. This made him hugely popular in the duchy.When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, Charles William Ferdinand saw an opportunity to replenish the state's treasury by renting its well-trained army to Great Britain. In 1776, Charles I signed a treaty supporting Britain in the war, the first prince to do so. Under the terms of this treaty, Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel supplied 4,000 troops for service with the British armies in America, under the command of general Friedrich Adolf Riedesel. Riedesel was given command of all the German troops serving in the Saratoga campaign, under British general John Burgoyne. Burgoyne was defeated in the Battles of Saratoga (1777), and his troops were taken captive as the Convention Army. Although the terms of surrender allowed the Convention Army to give their parole and return to Europe, the American Continental Congress revoked the convention. The Convention Army was kept in captivity until the war ended in 1783.\n\n\n=== Reign ===\nCharles I died in 1780, at which point Charles William Ferdinand inherited the throne. He soon became known as a model sovereign, a typical enlightened despot of the period, characterized by economy and prudence.The duke's combination of interest in the well-being of his subjects and habitual caution led to a policy of gradual reforms, a successful middle way between the conservatism of some contemporary monarchs and the over-enthusiastic wholesale changes pursued by others. He sponsored enlightenment arts and sciences; most notably he was patron to the young mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, paying for him to attend university against the wishes of Gauss' father.He resembled his uncle Frederick the Great in many ways, but he lacked the resolution of the king, and in civil as in military affairs was prone to excessive caution. He brought Brunswick into close alliance with the king of Prussia, for whom he had fought in the Seven Years' War; he was a Prussian field marshal, and was at pains to make the regiment of which he was colonel a model one.The duke was frequently engaged in diplomatic and other state affairs. In August 1784 he hosted a secret diplomatic visit from Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach (Goethe was a member of Karl August's entourage). The visit was disguised as a family visit, but was in fact to discuss the formation of a league of small- and mid-sized German states as a counterbalance within the Holy Roman Empire to Habsburg Monarchy's ambitions to trade the Austrian Netherlands for the Electorate of Bavaria. This F\u00fcrstenbund (League of Princes) was formally announced in 1785, with the Duke of Brunswick as one of its members and commander of its military forces. The league was successful in forcing the Austrian Joseph II to back down, and thereafter became obsolete.\nThe Swedish princess and diarist Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte visited Brunswick in 1799; she described the Duke as \"witty, literal and a pleasant acquaintance but ceremonial beyond description. He is said to be quite strict, but a good father of the nation who attends to the needs of his people.\"In 1803 the process of German Mediatisation led to the acquisition of the neighbouring imperial abbeys of Gandersheim and Helmstedt, which were secularised.\n\n\n== Military commander ==\n\nHe was made a Prussian general in 1773.\n\n\n=== War of the Bavarian Succession ===\nFrom 1778 to 1779 he served in the War of the Bavarian Succession. Frederick II praised the prince personally for his conduct during the war.\n\n\n=== Invasion of the Netherlands ===\n\nIn 1787 the Duke was made Generalfeldmarschall (field marshal) in the Prussian army. Frederick William II of Prussia appointed him as commander of a 20,000-strong Prussian force which was to invade the United Provinces of the Netherlands (The Dutch Republic). The goal was to suppress the Patriots of the Batavian Revolution, restoring the authority of the stadtholder William V of the House of Orange. Much of the country was in open revolt against William, whose personal troops were unable to quell the Patriot militias and the various Dutch provinces refused to aid him.\nThe Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica described the Duke's invasion: \"His success was rapid, complete and almost bloodless, and in the eyes of contemporaries the campaign appeared as an example of perfect generalship\". The Patriots were out-manoeuvred and overwhelmed: their militias were unable to put up any real resistance, were forced to abandon their insurrection, and many Patriots fled to France.The Duke's forces entered the Netherlands on 13 September and occupied Nijmegen that day. The largest Patriot force, 7,000 men under the Rhinegrave of Salm, was quickly out-manoeuvred and forced to abandon Utrecht, which the Duke occupied on 16 September. The Prussian force captured Gorcum on the 17th after a short artillery bombardment, followed by Dordrecht on the 18th and Delft on the 19th. They entered The Hague on the 20th, from which the Patriots had been forced to withdraw following a loyalist insurrection on the 17th. Amsterdam, the last city occupied by the Patriots, surrendered on 10 October. The campaign had taken less than a month. William V was restored to power, which he was to hold until 1795.\nBoth contemporaries and historians have praised the Duke's decisive campaign, in which he manoeuvred to concentrate his forces and achieve overwhelming local superiority, before moving on to the next city. He also received credit for the low number of casualties; one British observer suggested that \"the sap of the trees was the only blood shed\" (an exaggeration), referring to the wooden palisades and batteries constructed by both sides.\n\n\n=== War of the First Coalition ===\nAt the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition in the early summer of 1792, Ferdinand was poised with military forces at Coblenz. After the Girondins had arranged for France to declare war on Austria, voted on April 20, 1792, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II and the Protestant King of Prussia Frederick William II had combined armies and put them under Brunswick's command.\n\n\n==== The Brunswick Proclamation ====\n\nThe \"Brunswick Proclamation\" or \"Brunswick Manifesto\" that he now issued from Coblenz on July 25, 1792 threatened war and ruin to soldiers and civilians alike, should the Republicans injure Louis XVI and his family. His avowed aim was:\n\nto put an end to the anarchy in the interior of France, to check the attacks upon the throne and the altar, to reestablish the legal power, to restore to the king the security and the liberty of which he is now deprived and to place him in a position to exercise once more the legitimate authority which belongs to him.\nAdditionally, the manifesto threatened the French population with instant punishment should they resist the Imperial and Prussian armies, or the reinstatement of the monarchy. In large part, the manifesto had been written by Louis XVI's cousin, Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9, who was the leader of a large corps of \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the allied army.\nIt has been asserted that the manifesto was in fact issued against the advice of Brunswick himself; the duke, a model sovereign in his own principality, sympathized with the constitutional side of the French Revolution, while as a soldier he had no confidence in the success of the enterprise. However, having let the manifesto bear his signature, he had to bear the full responsibility for its consequences.\nThe proclamation was intended to threaten the French population into submission; it had exactly the opposite effect.\nIn Paris, Louis XVI was generally believed to be in correspondence with the Austrians and Prussians already, and the republicans became more vocal in the early summer of 1792. Rather than assuring the continued existence of the French monarchy, Brunswick's proclamation would instead ensure its downfall; the manifesto was rapidly distributed in Paris on July 28, apparently by monarchists, who badly misjudged the effect it would have. The Brunswick Manifesto seemed to furnish the agitators with a complete justification for the revolt that they were already planning. When news spread of a combined Austrian and Prussian army led by Brunswick marching into French soil on the days after the Manifesto was publicized, the Paris populace, already incensed by the threat against the city, exploded into violence. The first violent action was carried out on August 10, when the Tuileries Palace was stormed.\n\n\n==== Invasion of France ====\n\nThe Duke was disappointed that the British remained neutral.His initial advance into France was slowed by poor weather, the rough terrain of the Forest of Argonne, and an outbreak of dysentery among his troops.The Duke was less successful against the French citizens' army that met him at Valmy. Having secured Longwy and Verdun without serious resistance, he turned back after a mere skirmish in Valmy, and evacuated France.\nInitially the Duke intended to winter in the fortress of Verdun, before resuming the campaign in France the following spring. However Kellerman's forces outflanked him by advancing up the Rhine, recapturing French possessions there. The Duke abandoned Verdun on 8 October and Longwy on 22 October, before retreating back into Germany.\nWhen he counterattacked the Revolutionary French who had invaded Germany, in 1793, he recaptured Mainz after a long siege, but resigned in 1794 in protest at interference by Frederick William II of Prussia.\n\n\n=== War of the Fourth Coalition ===\n\nPrussia did not take part in the Second Coalition or Third Coalition against Revolutionary France. However, in 1806 Prussia declared war on France, beginning the War of the Fourth Coalition. Despite being over 70 years old, the Duke of Brunswick returned to command the Prussian army at the personal request of Louise, Queen of Prussia.By this stage the Prussian army was regarded as backward, using outdated tactics and with poor intelligence and communication. The structure of the high command has been particularly criticised by historians, with multiple officers developing differing plans and then disagreeing on which should be followed, leading to disorganisation and indecision.\nThe duke commanded the large Prussian army at Auerstedt during the double Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt on 14 October 1806. His forces were defeated by Napoleon's marshal Davout, despite the Prussians outnumbering the French around Auerstedt by two to one. During the battle he was struck by a musket ball and lost both of his eyes; his second-in-command Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau was also mortally wounded, causing a breakdown in the Prussian command. Severely wounded, the Duke was carried with his forces before the advancing French. He died of his wounds in Ottensen on 10 November 1806.\n\nThe duke's body was provisionally laid to rest in Christianskirche in 1806. It was later transferred for reburial in Brunswick Cathedral on 6 November 1819.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nOn 16 January 1764, Charles married Princess Augusta of Great Britain, eldest sister of King George III. The couple were second cousins to each other, being great-grandchildren of George I of Great Britain. As such, they were not related in a particularly close degree, yet there had been many bonds of marriage between the House of Brunswick-Bevern and the House of Hanover, themselves both branches of the House of Welf. Some commentators have pointed to inbreeding as a possible cause for the fact that many of the couple's children suffered from physical, mental or psychological disabilities. Indeed, the duke was once moved to describe his children to von Massenbach as \"mostly cripples in mind and body.\"Shortly after they married, the prince had the Schloss Richmond built for his wife. It was in English architectural style and with an English landscape garden, to remind her of her home.\nThe duke and his wife Augusta had four sons and three daughters. Three of their four sons suffered from major debilities. Their eldest son, Karl Georg August (1766\u20131806) was named heir apparent, but suffered from a significant learning disability and was regarded as \"well-nigh imbecile.\" Nevertheless, he was married in 1790 to Frederika of Orange-Nassau, daughter of William V, Prince of Orange, a gentle, good-hearted woman who remained devoted to him to the end. He died childless at the age of 40 in 1806, shortly before his father. The second son, Georg Wilhelm Christian (1769\u20131811), suffered from an even more severe learning disability than his elder brother. He was declared incapacitated and was excluded from the succession. He never married. The couple's third son was August (1770\u20131822). He was blind and was also excluded from the succession. He also never married. The fourth son, Friedrich Wilhelm (1771 \u2013 16 June 1815), was sound of mind and body. He eventually succeeded his father, married and sired two sons.\nFrederick and Augusta also had three daughters, two of whom reached adulthood. Neither of them was disabled, but both of them had similar, disastrous trajectories in life. Both of them were married to future kings, both made extreme failures of their marriages, both had extremely acrimonious relations with their husbands, and both were accused by them of similar faults: adultery, uncouth behavior, absence of dignity, falsehood and utter fecklessness. The elder daughter, Auguste Caroline Friederike (1764\u20131788), was the wife of the future king Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg and mother of the future William I of W\u00fcrttemberg. She separated from her husband and died in Russia from complications that arose while giving birth in secret to an illegitimate child. The younger daughter, Caroline of Brunswick, was married in 1795 to her first cousin, the future George IV of the United Kingdom, and bore him a daughter, the ill-fated Princess Charlotte of Wales. On two occasions (1806 and 1818\u201319), her husband made serious efforts to divorce her on grounds of adultery, forming commissions of inquiry to indict her, and after he became king, he in fact caused the House of Lords to pass a bill of divorce citing adultery with an Italian commoner. However, the bill was never introduced in the House of Commons and the divorce was never finalized. Caroline died three weeks after she was physically prevented from entering Westminster Abbey to participate in her husband's coronation.\nThe future Queen of Sweden, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described the ducal family thus:\n\nThe Duchess is the sister to the King of England and a typical Englishwoman. She looked very simple, like a vicar's wife, has I am sure many admirable qualities, and is very respectable, but completely lacks manners. She makes the strangest questions without considering how difficult and unpleasant they can be.....The sons of the Ducal couple are somewhat peculiar. The (eldest) prince, chubby and fat, almost blind, strange and odd - if not to say an imbecile - attempts to imitate his father but only makes himself artificial and unpleasant. He talks continually, does not know what he says, and is in all aspects unbearable. He is accommodating but a poor thing, loves his consort to the point of worship, and is completely governed by her. The (second) son, Prince Georg, is the most ridiculous person imaginable, and so silly that he can never be left alone but is always accompanied by a courtier. The third son is also described as an original. I never saw him, as he served with his regiment. The fourth is the only normal one, but also torments his parents by his immoral behaviour. \nThe duke also fathered at least one bastard, Forstenburg, who was healthy and began a promising military career before being killed in action during 1793.\n\n\n=== Issue ===\n\n\n=== Ancestry ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nText of the Proclamation of the Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg, 1792\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFitzmaurice, Edmond (1901).

          "What a wonderful medieval cathedral full of ancient artefacts , sculptures and tombs . Situated in the centre of this cracking little town , it reminds me of Worcester in England which ironically has an area called Brunswick which I am sure is the translation of Braunschweig.",
          "Very nice - attended services here as well. Very well preserved. The crypts in the cellar are quite eerie!",
          "I wandered into the church and was stunned by the beauty. Loads of original medieval art and furnishings. I greatly admire the care that\u2019s been taken with this piece of history. Strongly recommended.",
          "Also the tomb of Matilda of England - not the Queen! The crypt too os fascinating. Right in the centre of Braunschweig so cannot be missed",
          "We just missed a morning service, but the light and uncluttered feel of the cathedral with its many wonderful features was a welcome change from the crowded streets outside. From early mediaeval frescoes and sculptures, through to the tombs of Henry and Matilda, German royals",
          "We went in this place to listen a concert of organ; it was very nice and also a Dom it\u2019s really beautiful place.",
          "Very beautiful and romantic church, really a visit worth. There are a lot of old history to read about and a lot of sculptures to see.",
          "If in Braunschweig, you have to visit the old dome with it\u00b4s famous candle-holder with 7 arms and the grave of Heinrich the lion and his wife. It is a big chuch with many concerts during X-mas time, situated on the \"Burgplatz\". There is no entrance fee.",
          "This fantastic building shows how builders have brought there belief in god into stone. The church itself is without too much ornament, but the sheer height of the building is awesome. If you have the time and there's an organ or trumpet concert happening: Definitely a must",
          "This dom is in its own class because of the unusual murals inside on the walls and the ceilings. While the colors are kind of dull due to their ages, the murals deserve some careful viewing. See the accompanying photo.",
          "Take time to enter this lovely cathedral and feel the history of the town. There are some wonderful twisted columns on one side of the nave which are quite unique. There are guided tours in German and you can purchase a little written guide in English for 1Euro",
          "This is such a beautiful church, inside and out. The building itself is lovely, but then there's amazing paintings on the ceilings, on top of dried plaster. There's also a tomb that costs 1 Euro to enter, totally worth it! You see all kinds of ancient caskets and the stone tomb",
          "This is a great cathedral dated from the 12th century. There are some surprising aspects to it. It is very light inside in contrast to the huge exterior end portal. There is a wonderful medieval bronze chandelier, a very unusual Christ at the column and a very old Crucifixion",
          "Like many medieval churches and cathedrals, this one is large and imposing. But the best part has to do with the tombs, the statues, and the spectacular 7-armed candlestick with superb medieval figures, plants, and ornaments. The other great thing is the north aisle added to the",
          "A nice classic church but more interesting due to the unique columns along one side of the church and a sculpture.",
          "While we always enjoy seeing the great churches of Europe, this one disappointed in afraid to say. For some reason they've hung brightly colored letters spelling words hanging from above. Totally destroys the view of the Rose Window as well as the altar. I guess the \"modernists\"",
          "I had 24-hours in the city and found more than enough to do walking around the old town section which is dominated by the Dom. It is having some work done on the outside at the moment so not great for photographers but the inside of the cathedral offers some historical insights",
          "We called in while on a foot tour of the town. We found it to be a simple, but cold and empty place of worship. It did not take long to walk round and , when we were there, no guide was availle",
          "Wow! What a beautiful building. The staff working were friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is magical. Worth a visit!",
          "The location of the Dom is really nice, on a wonderful square with many other wonderful historical buildings.",
          "12th century Mathilda of England married Henry of Brunswick and they are buried here. Interesting architecture, especially the row of twisted columns. Spooky royal coffins in the crypt. Genuine 800 year old candelabra (ie not repro after the war - don't mention the war!).",
          "We walked around the exterior of the Dom and stopped inside for 15 minutes, prayed and admired the beautiful features of this church. - The columns on the left aisle had twisted columns, as compared to those of the right hand side aisle. - the frescoes of the ceiling above the",
          "The seven arm lighter and the architecture is very impressive. A very good place to discover a part of the Brunswick history.",
          "This beautifully kept medieval style church, built by Henry the Lion and completed by his wife, is a \"must see\" when visiting the church square. The crypt beneath the alter is the resting place of some of nobility and although a little eerie is well worth a visit. The inside of",
          "I didn't spend long here as I was on a post-conference walking tour but this cathedral has some pretty cool authentic medieval art. The Nazi era style crypt is an interesting contrast to the architecture of the rest of the cathedral. Henry the Lion is buried here next to his",
          "Pretty from the outside with interesting interior architecture. The tomb of Henry the Lion and his wife is right there in the center of the main floor, and downstairs, open to the public, is a mausoleum with several coffins. The church contains many significant pieces of",
          "a place full of history- amazing cathedral with the human remains of Henry the Lion and his Family-interesting for everyone who is interested in old buildings and architecture as well as history and saga. Lion statue in front of the cathedral is great, too.Besides, you can see",
          "Visit to the Dom is an asset when in Brunswick. There are concerts organized inside the cathedral on Saturdays and Sundays, it is impressive experience of sound of organs and chorus. Do not miss to go down to the secret rooms of Dom, you would feel like in Indiana Jones",
          "There is a lot to savour here, so take your time. The first glimpse might given the impression of a slightly chilly grandeur, but take a look at the elegant barley sugar twists on one -- yes just one - of the columns... Then notice the ancient carving of at the top of the left",
          "One of the nicest attraction in braunschweig. Majestic medieval structure but best place is under the altar. Richly ornamented Coffins give a surreal experience so do not miss it",
          "A great wonderful piece of medieval architecture. The oldest wooden cross, the colorful ancient painting, and some relationship with Bath Cathedral, and secret stories by locals. More information on leaflets can be available in different languages. It is a must to visit in",
          "Beautiful cathedral. Always take fmaily into the catacomb under the altar. Henry the lion and his wife are there, as well as many hapsburg nobles in metal caskets. A little creepy, but also interesting. they have information about who is buried there in many languages..",
          "It's a great piece of medieval architecture. The construction was started by Henry the Lion and finished by his wife Dutches Matilda. They both are buried in front of the altar with other members of the House of Braunschweig buried in the crypt. There's an entry fee but you can"
